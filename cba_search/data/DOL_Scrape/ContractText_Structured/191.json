The term \"he\" as used herein refers to any  \nemployee and shall apply equally to male and female  \nemployees.  \n"], ["ARTICLE 2\u00b0  \nSCOPE OF AGREEMENT  \n", "Section 1.  \nIt is agreed that this written contract reflects the entire  \nagreement between the parties. However, this Article  \n4  \nwill not restrict the Company and the Union by mutual!  \nagreement of adding amendments, interpretations or  \nclarifications of this agreement, or applying interpreta-  \ntion in accordance with the intent and purpose agreed  \nupon between the Union and the Company.  \nSection 2,  \nThe parties acknowledge that during the negotiations  \nwhich resulted in this Agreement, each has had the  \nunrestricted right and opportunity to present demands  \nand proposals with respect to any matter subject to  \ncollective bargaining. Therefore, the Company and  \nUnion freely agree that during the period of this Agree-  \nment neither party shall be obligated to bargain with  \nrespect to any matter or subject referred to in this  \nAgreement except in the manner specified herein.  \n"], ["ARTICLE 3  \nHOURS OF WORK  \n", "Section 1.  \nThe Company's regular workweek begin at Mid-  \nnight on Sunday and end at Midnight the following  \nSunday.  \nSection 2.  \nAn employee's workday shall begin at the time the  \nemployee starts to work and shall continue for twenty-  \nfour (24) consecutive hours, but in no event will an  \nemployee's workday begin earlier than twenty-four (24)  \nhours following the beginning of the preceding workday.  \nSection 3.  \nIt is understood and agreed that the Company shall  \n2  \nhave the right to schedule shifts both on a fixed and  \nrotating basis beginning and ending at times made  \nnecessary by the Company's production requirements.  \nThe Company will give the Union and the affected  \nemployees one (1) week's notice of any changes in the  \nstarting and ending times of such entire shifts, unless  \nthe reasons requiring the changes make it impractical  \nto give such notice.  \nSection 4. Overtime  \nIt is mutually agreed that the Company's operations  \nmay require performance of overtime work, in recogni-  \ntion of this, the Parties agree that overtime require-  \nments will be filled either by voluntary overtime oppor-  \ntunities or mandatory overtime work. Employees may  \nbe relieved of their obligation to work mandatory over-  \ntime if volunteers are obtained prior to the start of the  \nmandatory overtime.  \nA. Voluntary Overtime.  \n1. Definition. Voluntary overtime is when an employee  \nrequests or agrees to volunteer to work an overtime  \nopportunity,  \n2. Removal From Voluntary Overtime Consideration.  \nEmployees who do not want to work voluntary overtime  \nmust sign a statement with their appropriate manage-  \nment representative and a copy presented to the Local  \nUnion. Such employee will not be asked for voluntary  \novertime until he notifies the Company and Union in  \nwriting of his desire. At such time he will be charged the  \nhighest number of opportunities for overtime work he  \n3  \nnormally performs. This provision will not excuse the  \nemployee from their turn for mandatory overtime.  \nB. Equalization of Overtime Opportunities,  \n1. It ts agreed that overtime work will be offered on a  \nreasonably equal basis, catculated to the  \nemployees who normally perform such work. However,  \nno employees will be paid for time not actually worked  \nunder this Section, and in the event employees do not  \nreceive their proportionate share of overtime work as  \nprovided herein, such will be given prefer-  \nence until they have reached their proportionate share,  \nas provided in Paragraph B 4 below.  \n2. The Company will maintain and post a uniform  \novertime sheet for each job classification and shift  \nshowing overtime opportunities provided for the em-  \nployees who normally perform the work, as well as a  \nrecord of alt overtime worked by employees outside of  \nthe classification. The overtime sheets will be uniform  \nacross all classifications and work areas, and will  \ninclude codes identifying the opportunities.  \n3. Monthly overtime sheets will be made available for  \ninspection by the employee during the first week of the  \nmonth. Employees will be responsible to examine, sign  \nand report any errors during that week.  \n4. Employees who are low in opportunities will be  \ngiven preference the following month for overtime work  \nwithin their classification on work they normally per-  \nform.  \n5. On a monthly bais the Steward and appropriate  \nmanagement representative will review the overtime  \nsheets. Supervisors will be reasonably available to  \nmeet with shop stewards to review overtime sheets. If  \ninequities for opportunities exist a plan of action will be  \nagreed upon to correct the problem. Should the parties  \nbe unable to agree upon aplan of action or should a plan  \nnot be followed, the Steward will refer the matter to the  \nBusiness Agent who will meet with the Plant Industrial  \nRelations Supervisor to establish corrective action. If  \nthe Union believes the inequity continues, the Union  \nBusiness Agent may meet with the Plant Manager.  \nWhere it is agreed an inequity exists the Plant Manager  \nwill meet with the management Leader to ensure that a  \nplan is developed to address the inequity.  \n6. In order to equalize the overtime of a person who is  \nbeing transferred from one department or from one job  \nto another, he will be credited with the highest total of  \naccumulated overtime incurred on the new job in that  \ndepartment.  \n7. Employees who are assigned or transferred to a job  \nother than a bargaining unit job will be credited, upon  \nreturn to the bargaining unit, with the total of the  \novertime hours he worked in the non-unit job or the  \novertime hours worked of the highest employee in the  \njob classification that the employee is returning to in the  \nbargaining unit, whichever is higher.  \n8. All overtime sheets will be zeroed out effective upon  \nratification of the contract. The Company will agree to  \nreview specific problem areas identified by the Union  \nand not zero out those hours until mutually agreed that  \n5  \nthe problem has been addressed, and corrected if  \npossible.  \nC. Mandatory Overtime.  \n1. Definition. Mandatory overtime refers to any over-  \ntime the employee is required to work for which the  \nemployee did not volunteer.  \n2. Employees will work up to, but not exceeding, four  \n(4) hours mandatory overtime per workday for up to Six  \n(6) times per month, subject to the following provisions:  \na. Employees will be permitted to refuse manda-  \ntory overtime up to four (4) times per rolling twelve (12)  \nmonths. Documentation of each refusal will be provided  \nto the employee. Emptoyees will be expected to sign  \nthe documentation of each refusal and will receive a  \ncopy thereof. Each employee who works mandatory  \novertime more than six (6) times in a calendar month will  \nbe granted an additional refusal for each mandatory  \novertime work, that cannot be used in the immediately  \nfollowing ten (10) working days, but must be used  \nduring the rolling twelve (12).month period. A refusal of  \novertime in excess of the number permitted under this  \nArticle 3, Section C will result in immediate termination.  \nb, Overtime for vacations and other known vacan-  \ncies may be scheduled at least seven days in advance.  \nFor other vacancies that may occur, employees as-  \nsigned mandatory overtime will generally be notified at  \nleast 48 hours in advance. in instances where the  \nvacancy is not known 48 hours in advance, notice will  \n6  \nbe given as soon as is reasonable after the vacancy is  \nknown.  \nc. Itis understood that if the Company is unable to  \nmeet its manning requirements, as it has determined,  \nthrough volunteers and/or the use of mandatory over-  \ntime, the Company has the right to fill its requirements  \nfrom any source it deems appropriate from within the  \nbargaining unit. Under this section, an employee work-  \ning in a job other than his or her regular job will receive  \nthe rate of his or her regular job or the rate of the job to  \nwhich he or she works, whichever is higher.  \nd. Employees who volunteer to work another  \nemployee's mandatory overtime, the employee who  \nwas going to work mandatory overtime will be credited  \nwith working the mandatory overtime.  \ne. Employees will not be picked up on the manda-  \ntory overtime rotation for any reason, when returning to  \nwork, except for a reported absence, unreported ab-  \nsence or leaving early on their scheduled shift,  \nuntil their next regular turn in order occurs. It is agreed  \nthat if an employee leaves early on overtime it will be  \nrecorded as a \u201cleave early\u201d pursuant to Article 8,  \nSection 4, and the employee will not be credited as  \nhaving worked a mandatory overtime under this Article,  \nbut will be charged with an overtime opportunity.  \nf. Employees required to work overtime for a pe-  \nriod of four (4) housr after their regular shift will be  \npermitted a company phone to cali home.  \ng. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Com-  \n7  \npany from requiring an employee to work mandatory.  \novertime in the hours immediately preceding or follow-  \ning his or her regularly schedule shift. Employees who  \nare given less than 24 hours notice of the requirement  \nto work mandatory overtime in the hours immediately  \npreceding his or her regularly scheduled shift will re-  \nceive double the straight time hourly rate for these  \nmandatory overtime hours.  \nh. Itis agreed that the Company will not temporarily  \ntransfer employees from one job classification to an-  \nother for the purpose of shifting overtime.  \ni. Mandatory overtime will be rotated from the  \njunior employee to the senior employee in each group.  \nD. Maintenance Overtime  \nMaintenance overtime will be first offered to employees  \nwho normally perform such work, in the following order:  \n1. Daylight employees will be offered daylight over-  \ntime.  \n2. Shift employees will be offered shift overtime.  \n3. In the event no employees desire the overtime on  \ndays, the Company will offer the overtime to shift  \nemployees who are available.  \n4. In the event no employees desire the overtime on  \nshift, the Company will offer the overtime to daylight  \nemployees who are available.  \n8  \n5. Inthe event the Company cannot obtain voluntary  \novertime in the above manner, the junior employee  \neither on the daylight shift or the junior employee on  \nshift, will work the overtime in his group. Mandatory  \novertime will be rotated from the junior employee to the  \nsenior employee in each group. Daylight employee  \novertime will be equalized. Shift employee overtime will  \nbe equalized.  \nSection 5.  \nTime and one-half the straight time hourly rate will be  \npaid for all hours worked by an employee over eight (8)  \nhours in any employees\u2019 workday and over forty (40)  \nhours in any workweek.  \nSection 6.  \nDouble time the straight time hourly rate will be paid for  \nall hours worked by an employee on the seventh (7th)  \nconsecutive workday worked in the regular workweek.  \nSection 7.  \nTime and (1 1/2) the straight time hourly rate  \nwill be paid for alt hours worked by an employee on  \nSunday.  \nSection 8.  \nAn employee who is temporarily transferred, as pro-  \nvided herein, for the convenience of the Company, toa  \njob other than his regular job, and on which job such  \nemployee has not previously qualified to receive the  \nqualified rate will receive the rate of his or the  \nbeginning rate of the job to which he is transferred,  \nwhichever ts higher. An employee who is temporarily  \ntransferred, as provided, herein, for the convenience of  \n9  \n   \nSee =  \nthe > Company, to a job on which such employee has  \n\u2018previously qualified to:receive the qualified rate forthat  \njob will receive the rate of his job or the qualified rate of  \nthe job to which he is transferred, whichever is higher.  \nin all other cases other than for the convenience of the  \nCompany, emptoyees wil! be paid either at the begin--  \nning of qualified rate of the job to which they are  \ntransferred, whichever is applicable.  \nSection 9.  \nNo change will be made in an work sched-  \nule in a given workweek after such workweek has  \nbegun for purposes of equalizing his time or otherwise  \nfor the purpose of affecting his hours of work to avoid or  \nchange overtime payments required by this Contract.  \nThis Section shali not apply in case of curtailments,  \ncutbacks or recalls.  \nSection 10.  \nEmployees working on second shift will be paid a  \npremium of $.30 per hour. Employees working on third  \nshift will be paid a premium of $.40 per hour.  \nSection 17.  \nThere shall be no pyramiding of overtime or premium  \npay under this Contract. In computing an employee's  \novertime and premium pay for a given day or week, that  \nbasis which is most favorable to the employee wiff be  \nused,  \nSection 12.  \nNothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of  \nany given number of days per week or hours per day of  \n10  \nwork except as specifically otherwise provided for in  \nthis Agreement.  \n\u2018Section 13.  \nUnless otherwise scheduled by supervision, employ-  \nees are required to be at their work station ready for  \nwork at the time their shift begins and will not leave their  \nwork station at the end of the shift until their shift ends.  \nIn addition, unless specifically scheduled by supervi-  \nsion, employees will not be allowed to report to their  \nwork station more than five (5) minutes before the  \nbeginning of their shifts, and all employees will leave  \ntheir work station promptly at the end of their shift.  \nSection 14.  \nThere shall be no split shifts other than shifts split forthe  \npurpose of providing non-paid lunch periods.  \nSection 15. Reporting and Call-In Pay  \nA. employee reports for work in accordance with  \nhis schedule without being notified not to report at least  \none {1) hour prior to the beginning of his shift (by  \ntelephone, in person or bulletin board notification} that  \nhis services will not be required on his next scheduled  \nwork shift and who nevertheless reports on time for his  \nwork on such day and is not required to work or is given  \nless than four (4) hours of consecutive work during his  \nshift, shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours pay,  \nunless such employee quits, is discharged, or sus-  \npended for cause, or voluntarily seeks time off, of is laid  \noff by reason of a work stoppage or an emergency  \nforced close down of the plant or his job beyond the  \ncontrol of the Company (such as major machinery  \nbreakdown, fire, flood, power failure, bomb threats or  \n114  \nother acts beyond the control of the Company). In any  \nevent, the employee must accept any work offered for  \nsuch four (4) hour period. In the event an employee is  \nsent home from work after four (4) hours, department  \nseniority, within a job classification, will be the determin-  \ning factor.  \nB. Employees who are called in after they have teft the  \nplant or before they report to the plant for their regular  \nshift for work on shifts other than their own, will receive  \na minimum of four (4) hours work or four (4) hours pay  \nunder the same conditions, restrictions, and provisions  \nprovided for above in the case of reporting in pay,  \nincluding the requirement that such employees must  \naccept whatever work is available and assigned to them  \nby the Company. For purpose of this Call-In Pay Sec-  \ntion, an employee will be deemed to have left the piant  \nand have been called in if request is made to him to work  \nafter he has clocked out. If such employee is called into  \nwork less than four (4) hours the beginning of his  \nregular shift and work is made available to him on a  \ncontinuous basis until the beginning of his regular shift  \nthen the provision herein for call-in pay will not apply.  \nC. The four (4) hours pay provided for above for  \nreporting pay and the four (4) hours pay provided for  \nabove for call-in pay shall not be less thanthe employee's  \nregular job rate or the applicable rate the employee  \nwould receive for work during such period whichever is  \nhigher.  \nD, Employees who are requested to come to the plant  \nby the Company or designated representative for the  \npurpose of attending meetings will be paid at the  \n12  \napplicable base or premium rate of pay for actual time  \nSpent in such meetings and the Provisions above for  \nor call-in pay will not apply.  \nSection 16.  \nDouble the straight time rate will be paid after- twelve  \n(12) hours work in any one (1) workday as such.  \nAll consecutive hours worked in excess of twelve (12)  \nconsecutive hours of work will be paid for at the rate of  \ndouble time even though some such hours may fall in  \nthe next work day.  \n"], ["ARTICLE 4  \nMAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS  \n", "It is agreed that any monetary benefit currently being  \nprovided by the Company on a uniform basis to all  \nemployees and not specifically provided for in this  \nAgreement will nevertheless be continued for the dura-  \ntion of the Agreement. It is further understood that this  \nprovision will not increase nor decrease the monetary  \nbenefits that are specifically provided for in this Agree-  \nment.  \n"], ["ARTICLE \u00a7  \nSENIORITY  \n", "Section 1.  \nA. Seniority as used hereinafter is defined as follows:  \n1, Plant seniority shall mean an employee's length of  \nservice dating from his last date of hire into the plant.  \n13  \n2. Departmental seniority shall mean an employee's  \nlength of service dating from his last date of hire into, or  \npermanent transfer into, a department within the plant,  \nwhich department shal! also be known as his home  \ndepartment. Employees cannot carry department se-  \nniority in more than one department at any one time.  \n3. Protected seniority shall mean the total department  \nseniority which an employee had in his last home  \ndepartment at the time he was permanently transferred  \ninto his present department. Employees cannot carry  \nprotected seniority in more than one department at any  \none time.  \n4. Temporary department seniority shall mean the  \ntime employees accumulate in departments other than  \ntheir home department as a result of a cutback or recall.  \nB. In applying seniority as provided hereinafter as  \nbetween employees with equal department seniority,  \nplant seniority will be the determining factor. If plant and  \ndepartment seniority are equal, the employee with the  \nlowest clock number shall be considered the senior  \nemployee. In application of plant seniority, where plant  \nseniorities are the same, the employee with the lowest  \nclock number shall be considered the senior employee.  \nIn application of the protected seniority where the  \nprotected seniority is the same, plant seniority shall be  \nthe determining factor and where the plant seniority is  \nthe same, the employee with the lowest clock number  \nshall be considered the senior employee.  \nC. New employees shail be regarded as probationary  \nemployees for the first ninety (90) working days of  \n14  \nservice and have no seniority rights during said proba-  \ntionary period, During said probationary period, the  \nCompany shall have the absolute right to lay off,  \ntransfer, discipline or discharge such employees with-  \nout recourse on the part of such employees or the Union  \nunder the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure. Proba-  \ntionary employees will be entitled to leaves of absence  \nas outlined in Article 9 except leaves of absence time  \nwill not count toward completing the probationary pe-  \nriod. Upon completion of such probationary period the  \nemployees will be credited with seniority from the date  \nof hire. The Company shall at all times be the sole judge  \nof whom it shall hire.  \nD. New employees will be afforded the opportunity to  \nsign check-off authorization and the Union application  \nblanks upon receiving employment. After the proba-  \ntionary period is completed, the Company shall deduct  \nUnion initiation fees and Union duesin such amounts as  \nare certified by the Local Union.  \nSection 2. Seniority Departments  \nA. The Company's seniority departments shal! be as  \nfollows:  \n1. Forming - which shail include Batch, Chem Prep,  \nFurnace, Binder Room, and Forming.  \n2. Fabrication - which shall include Endfinding, Twist  \nand Ply, Packing and Re-fab.  \n3. Special Fabrication - which shail include Beaming,  \nand Multitex.  \n15  \n4. Maintenance which shall include Mechanica! Main-  \ntenance, Electrical Maintenance, Alloy, Utilities and  \nBuilding and Grounds.  \n5. Warehouse and Shipping.  \n6. Purchasing and Stores; and  \n7. Quality Services  \nB. The Company shall have the right to consolidate  \ndepartments, create new departments or to rearrange  \ndepartment structures in a manner other than shown in  \nSection A hereof, provided it gives notice of its intention  \nto do so to the Union and meets with the Union upon  \nrequest to agree on the proper method of determining  \nthe seniority rights of the employees involved in such  \nnew, rearranged or meshed departments.  \nSection 3. Seniority Rosters  \nThe Company wil prepare and post on the bulletin  \nboards at the end of each quarter a seniority roster  \nshowing the department, plant and protected seniority  \nof each employee.  \nA copy of the seniority roster will be furnished to the  \nUnion. Unless a protest is made concerning the senior-  \nity standing of any employee within thirty (30) days after  \nthe posting of the roster, then such roster and seniority  \nstanding shown thereon shall be conclusively deemed  \nto be correct.  \nSection 4.  \nAn employee's continuous service and his seniority will  \n16  \nbe considered terminated if he:  \nA. Quits or is discharged:  \nB. Is furloughed for a period of eighteen (18) consecu-  \ntive months or if the employee has three (3) or more  \nyears of service is furloughed for a period of thirty six  \n(36) consecutive months.  \nC. Fails to report to work at the \u20acxpiration of the leave  \nof absence granted by the Company under Article 9  \nhereof.  \nD. Fails to return to work from furlough within seven (7)  \ndays after notification by the Company to return to his  \njob (or other jobs for which he is Q-rated as provided in  \nSection 5 (C) (4) hereof) through notice by certified mail  \nwith registered return receipt. (The seven (7) days  \nperiod will be computed from the date of the maiting by  \ncertified mail to the employee's last known address).  \nE. If absent three (3) or more consecutive workdays  \nwithout notice unless such employee furnishes a justi-  \nfiable reason for failure to give such notice.  \nSection 5. Curtaitments and Recalls  \nAs used hereinafter, a temporary reduction in force  \nshall mean a reduction in force lasting or expecting to  \nlast eight (8) hours or longer, but less than fifteen (15)  \ndays. A reduction in force other than a temporary  \nreduction in force shall mean reduction in force lasting  \nor expecting to last longer than fifteen (15) days. The  \nCompany agrees to advise employees as soon as it  \nknows or can reasonably ascertain whether a reduction  \n17  \nin force is expected to last less or longer than fifteen (15)  \ndays in order that employees may exercise the rights  \nprovided hereinafter. As used herein \"Q-rated\" means  \njobs on which the employee has received the qualified  \nrate. A furloughed employee is an employee who is not  \nworking in the plant. A cutback employee is an em-  \nployee who has been displaced from his job but is  \nworking on another job in the plant.  \nCURTAILMENTS  \nOTHER THAN TEMPORARY  \nA. Inthe event ofa curtailment, the following procedure  \nwill be used:  \n4. employee is displaced from his job as a result  \nof a reduction in force other than a temporary reduction  \nin force as defined above, he may elect by the end of his  \nsecond working day to take a voluntary furlough, or he  \nmust exercise his department seniority to displace the  \njunior department seniority employee in his regular job  \nclassification on any shift in his department.  \n2. Upon exhausting his department seniority in his  \nregular job classification, the employee may elect by  \nthe end of his second working day to take a voluntary  \nfurlough or wil! roll the junior department seniority  \nemployee in any equivalent paying job on any shiftin his  \ndepartment on which he had been Q-rated. Employees  \npreviously Q-rated in jobs that have been combined or  \neliminated into newly created jobs will have curtailment/  \ncutback rights to the newly created jobs. However, if  \nsuch employee cannot displace an employee on an  \nequivalent paying job, he will roll the junior department  \n18  \n\u2014,  \nseniority employee in the next lower paying job classi-  \nfication on any shift in his department on which he has  \nbeen Q-rated in descending order. As a last step before  \nbeing displaced from his department, the employee  \nwith more department seniority may elect by the end of  \nhis second working day to take a voluntary furlough or  \nwill roll the junior department seniority employee on a  \nbeginning or exit job even though he is not Q-rated on  \nsuch beginning or exit job provided he is capable of  \nperforming such beginning or exit job.  \n3. Any employee who is displaced, by the above  \nprocedure may by the end of his second working day  \nelect to take voluntary furlough or he must exercise his  \nprotected seniority from the last department from which  \nhe was permanently transferred. !n applying protected  \nseniority to his last home department he shall first apply  \nhis seniority to the highest rated job classification on  \nany shift in which he is Q-rated and if such employee  \nhas insufficient protected seniority to displace the junior  \ndepartment seniority employee in that job classifica-  \ntion, he will then be allowed to use his protected  \nseniority to roll the junior department seniority em-  \nployee in any equivalent paying job on any shift in this  \ndepartment on which he had been Q-rated. However, if  \nsuch employee cannot displace an employee on any  \nequivalent paying job, he will roll the junior department  \nseniority employee\u2019on the next lower paying job classi-  \nfication on any shift in his department on which he has  \nbeen Q-rated in descending order. As a last step before  \nbeing displaced from the department from which he has  \nprotected seniority an employee with more protected  \nseniority may elect by the end of his second working day  \nto take a voluntary furlough or he will roll the junior  \n19  \ndepartment seniority employee on @ beginning or exit  \njob even though he is not Q-rated on such beginning or  \nexit job, provided he is capable of performing such job.  \n4. lf an employee has exhausted his depariment se-  \nniority and his protected seniority, he may elect by the  \nend of his second working day to take a voluntary  \nfurlough or he wilt be assigned by the Company to a job  \nin another department, provided he has sufficient plant  \nseniority and provided he is capable of performing such  \njob in the following order:  \na. Where there is a vacancy on a beginning or exit job,  \nprovided that he is capable of performing such begin-  \nning or exit job and further provided that other employ-  \nees with more department and/or Plant seniority did not  \nhave prior claim on such vacant job.  \nb. The job of the least senior employee in the Plant on  \na beginning or exit job.  \nc. Appendix A lists beginning and exit jobs. Employ-  \nees who are assigned by the Company to an exit or  \nbeginning job, where there is a vacancy, will be as-  \nsigned on the basis of their Plant seniority to the highest  \njob classification in which they had previously been Q-  \nrated.  \nd. Senior department employees in ajob classification  \nbeing reduced by curtailment other than temporary may  \ntake a votuntary furlough by mutual agreement be-  \ntween the Company and the Union. Employees in the  \naffected classification have the responsibility to inform  \nthe Company of their request for a voluntary furlough  \n20  \n   \nand must make this request within two working days  \nafter employees are notified of the  \nTEMPORARY CURTAILMENTS  \nB. 1. tf an employee is from his job as a  \nresult of a temporary reduction in force as defined  \nabove and such employee is not the junior department  \nseniority employee in his job classification on his regu-  \nlar shift, he will displace such junior department senior-  \nity employee in his job classification on his regular shift.  \n2. Upon exhausting his department seniority in his  \nregular job classification on his regular shift, the em-  \nployee will exercise his department seniority to roll the  \njunior department seniority employee in any equivalent  \npaying job on that shift in his department on which he  \nhad heen Q-rated; however, if such employee cannot  \ndisplace an employee on any equivalent paying job, he  \nwill roll the junior departmental seniority employee in  \nthe next lower paying job classification on his regular  \nshift in his department on which he has been Q-rated in  \ndescending order. Upon exhausting his department  \nseniority on his shift, as a last step before being  \ntemporarily furloughed, such employee wilj roll the  \njunior department seniority employee on a beginning  \njob on any shift in his department even though he is not  \nQ-rated on such beginning job provided he is capable of  \nperforming such job.  \n3. If an employee is displaced from his department  \nduring a temporary curtailment, he will be placed on  \ntemporary furlough.  \n21  \n4. In temporary cutbacks, employees will not be en-  \ntitled fo take voluntary furlough but will take the job  \nassignment as provided above.  \n5. The beaming area and the Muititex area will be  \nconsidered as separate departments under the tempo-  \nrary curtailment provisions outlined in the Contract for  \ncurtailments lasting from 8 hours to a maximum of 4  \ndays. (This will pertain to primarily shutdowns related to  \nHoliday curtailments.)  \nRECALLS  \nC. Employees will be recalled in the following order and  \nsubject to the following procedure:  \n1. Furloughed employees lose all rights of recall and  \ntheir employment will be terminated at the end of  \neighteen (18) consecutive months or thirty six (36)  \nconsecutive months, whichever is applicable, on fur-  \nlough. A cutback employee does not Jose his recall  \nrights regardless of the length of time he is in cutback  \nstatus.  \n2. An employee who has been displaced from a job  \nother than a beginning job shall be entitled to recall in  \naccordance with his department seniority to any va-  \ncancy that arises in a job classification in his depart-  \nment for which he was Q-rated in ascending arder. An  \nemployee who has been displaced from a beginning job  \nwithin a department will be entitled to recall to such  \nbeginning job in accordance with his department se-  \nniority unless there is an employee on furlough who has  \nmore plant seniority than such employee and the em-  \n22  \n   \nployee on furlough with more plant seniority is capable  \nof performing such beginning job and has indicated in  \nwriting a desire to be considered for jobs in such  \ndepartments.  \n3. Furloughed employees will be given preference  \nover hiring new employees for work they are capable of  \nperforming in line with their plant seniority in depart-  \nments other than the departments from which they were  \nfurloughed, provided such furloughed employees have  \nfiled a written application for available work on such jobs  \nwith the Human Resources Office. Such right or prefer-  \nential consideration in other departments shall be avail-  \nable to the employees for a period of eighteen (18)  \nconsecutive months or thirty six (36) consecutive  \nmonths, whichever is applicable, from the date of their  \nfurlough. If pursuant to their request an employee is  \noffered work in other departments and refuses or fails  \nto accept such work he will forfeit his right to any other  \nsuch work in any other such departments.  \n4, The Company has the right to offer employees on  \nfurlough, jobs that they are capable of performing rather  \nthan hire new employees to fill such jobs. If none of the  \nemployees on furlough in line with their plant seniority  \nare willing to accept such other jobs that are offered by  \nthe Company, then the Company shalt have the right to  \nrequire the junior plant seniority employee who is Q-  \nrated on such job to accept such job. Such junior plant  \nseniority employee who fails and refuses within seven  \n(7) days after notification to report to work on such job  \nwill be terminated and lose seniority.  \n5 Recalls from temporary curtailments shall be in  \n23  \nce  \n=  \nSse  \nSS ESSE  \nreverse order of the  \nD. assigned to another job by virtue of the  \nabove cutback or recall pracedures must demonstrate  \ntheir ability to perform the jab. Employees cutback to  \njobs in which they have been Q-rated must demon-  \nstrate within forty-five (45) working days that they are  \ncapable of fully performing the job. Employees cutback  \nto jobs in which they have nat been Q-rated must  \ndemonstrate within sixty (60) working days that they are  \ncapable of fully performing the job. If it is determined  \nduring the forty-five (45) or sixty (60) working day period  \nthat such employee is unable ta fully perform the jab,  \nsuch employee may eject to take voluntary furlough or  \nwill avail himself of such cutback opportunities as his  \nseniority would otherwise him. Empfoyees cut-  \nback to jobs in which they have been Q-rated wil!  \nreceive the Q-rate for such jobs, but must nevertheless  \ndemonstrate wihtin the forty-five (45) working day pe-  \nriod that they are capable of fulling performing the jab.  \nEmployees cutback to beginning jabs below Rate Group  \n7 will receive the Q-rate for the job even though they are  \nnot Q-rated an such job. In all other instances where  \nemployees are cutback to jobs on which they are not Q-  \nrated, they will receive the beginning rate for such jobs.  \nThe Company, at its discretion, may provide additionat  \ntime and training in exceptional circumstances.  \n   \n\u00a3. inthe event of a cutback or furlough, the successful  \nbidder, who had been promoted to a straight-day job,  \nand remained on the straight-day job for thirty (30) days,  \nwill have the right to claim the straight-day job in his  \nclassification on a recalt basis.  \n24  \nTT  \n    \nCURTAILMENTS IN MAINTENANCE  \nSection 6.  \nFor purposes of cutbacks and furloughs either tempo-  \nrary or other than temporary and for purposes of recalls  \nin the Maintenance Department, the Company shall  \ndetermine the skills that must be retained or required  \nand the areas in the Maintenance Department  \nwill be handled separately:  \n. Mechanica!  \n. Electrical  \n. Utility  \n. Alloy  \n. Building and Grounds  \nan & WG A) =  \nIn the event of any cutback, an employee in one of the  \nabove five (5) areas will not be allowed to use his  \ndepartment seniority for purposes of rolling an em-  \nployee in one of the above other listed areas unless:  \n1. Such employee has been Q-rated in the area in  \nwhich he seeks to displace a junior employee; and, in  \naddition,  \n2. Unless such employee has demonstrated by actual  \nperformance on the job that he is fully capable of  \nperforming ail of the job duties, skills and functions of  \nthe junior employee he seeks to displace.  \ntn the event of a cutback within an area employees will  \nbe cutback on the basis of department seniority. it is  \nrecognized that in times of such cutback the Company  \n25  \nmay assign cutback employees within the classification  \nwithout regard to particular skills.  \nThe restrictions imposed above for cutbacks will apply  \nfor recails involving Maintenance Department employ-  \nees.  \nMaintenance Department employees who have ex-  \nhausted their department seniority as above set forth  \nwill then be entitled to use their protected seniority and/  \nor plant seniority as in the case of all other employees  \nprovided hereinabove.  \nThe Union and the Company have acknowledged that  \nvarious craft skills have been recognized within the  \nMaintenance Department in the past. The Company  \nhas discussed with the Union that more efficient utiliza-  \ntion of craft personnet is necessary in the competitive  \nworld in which we live. The objective is to utilize the craft  \nwork force as efficiently and effectively as possible  \nwithout regard to jurisdictional constraints within the  \nMMM, ELE and UEP job classifications. Assistance  \nbetween classifications will be expected and incidental  \nwork will be routine.  \nThe Company has recognized the Union's concerns  \nabout the safety of it's workers and the fact that there  \nwill need to be additional training of Maintenance em-  \nployees. The Company agrees to provide this training  \nand instruction on Company time. Employees will be  \nexpected to make good faith efforts to perform assigned  \nwork, Itis recognized that employees will not be subject  \nto disciplinary action for work they are not capable of  \nperforming.  \n26  \nThe Company agrees that these changes will not result  \nin a cutback of craft personnel in Maintenance.  \nMISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  \nSection 7.  \nIn cutbacks and in recalls the Company will make every  \nattempt to provide displacement rights and recall rights  \nto affected employees as soon as practicable. It is  \nunderstood that the determination of seniority rights of  \nrespective employees and the subsequent notification  \nof employees will require some time. For this reason the  \nCompany will be allowed a reasonable time to accom-  \nplish the seniority placements of employees both in  \ncutback and in recail. If an employee or the Union feels  \nthat the Company has displaced an employee or re-  \ncalled an employee in violation of the rights of such  \nemployee under the seniority provisions herein, a griev-  \nance may be filed and if it is later determined that the  \nCompany has, in fact, displaced or recalled an em-  \nployee in violation of his seniority rights as contained  \nherein, then such employee will be entitled to any back  \npay such employee may have suffered by virtue of such  \nviolation beginning as of the shift following the filing of  \nthe grievance.  \nSection 8.  \nA. Employees displaced from their home seniority  \ndepartment and who take jobs in other departments by  \nusing protected seniority rights wit! not accumulate  \nadditional protected seniority rights while working in a  \ncutback status in the department in which they carry  \nprotected seniority rights.  \n2?  \nB. Employees working in departments other than their  \nhome seniority department due to cutbacks whether  \nthey are working in such other department as a result of  \nexcercised protected seniority or plant seniority rights  \nwill accumulate temporary department seniority rights  \ndating from the date of their last entry into such depart-  \nment by virtue of cutbacks which temporary department  \nseniority may be used for purposes of job progression  \nand cutbacks in such other department. Such tempo-  \nrary department seniority will be lost when the em-  \nployee leaves the departmeni.  \nC. An employee in a department as a result of exer-  \ncised protected seniority may, at time of a cutback in  \nthat department, exercise his protected seniority or  \ntemporary department seniority, whichever is greater.  \nD. Ifanemployee is working ina department otherthan  \nhis home department by reason of cutbacks and subse-  \nquently such employee refuses recall to his regular job  \nin his home department and elects to stay in his new  \ndepartment, the new department will become his home  \nseniority department with seniority dating from his last  \ndate of entry into such other department whether such  \nentry was by the exercise of plant seniority or protected  \nseniority; and such employee's former home depart-  \nment seniority date to the date of his election not to  \nreturn to such home seniority in his from home seniority  \ndepartment. He will then lose any former protected  \nseniority in other departments.  \nE. An employee who is cutback from his home depart-  \nment into his protected seniority department for a  \nperiod of two (2) or more consecutive years wil) have the  \n28  \noption to assign his protected seniority and his tempo-  \nrary department seniority to his cutback department as  \nnew department seniority. Employees who elect this  \noption forfeit all recall rights to their former position.  \nEmployees will be responsible to notify the Company of  \ntheir election of this option.  \nEmployees who are cutback and are notified by the  \nCompany that there is no intention of ever recalling  \nthem to their job, this option, even though they  \nhave not been cutback two (2) or more consecutive  \nyears.  \nSection 9.  \nItis understood and agreed that in every instance where  \nanemployee is assigned to a job classification for which  \nhe has not been Q-rated, whether such assignment of  \njobs be due to reassignments in times of cutback and  \nrecall or as a result of job bid and promotion, if such  \nemployee is unable to satisfactorily perform the job, he  \nwill be returned to the status from which he was  \nassigned to the job classification and will not be eligible  \nfor assignment to that job classification for twelve (12)  \nmonths.  \nSection 10. PROMOTIONS  \nA. Permanent vacancies within the unit  \n(vacancies that the Company intends to fill which are  \nexpected to last sixty (60) or more days) other than  \nvacancies in the Maintenance Department which pro-  \ncedures are set forth in a separate section below, will be  \nhandled as follows: will be posted and will be filled from  \nbidders from within the department who are capable of  \nperforming the jobs on the basis of department senior-  \nity. If there are no bidders within the department ca-  \n29  \npable of performing the jobs then the jobs will be filled  \nfrom those employees bidding from other departments  \nwho are capable of performing the jobs based on plant  \nseniority and then by hiring new employees.  \nB. The Company reserves the right to determine, from  \ntime to time, the number of employees and the skills  \nrequired from employees in the Maintenance Depart-  \nment. In the event the Company determines that addi-  \ntional employees will be required in a particular job  \nClassification or to perform a particular skill within a job  \nclassification, it will post such job classification along  \nwith the skill requirements for such jobs and the jobs will  \nbe awarded on the basis of department seniority to  \nemployees within the department who are capable of  \nperforming, including the particular skills required as a  \npart of such jobs. If there are no employees within a  \ndepartment who desire or are capable of fully perform-  \ning the jobs, then the jobs will be awarded to employees  \nwithin the plant who are fully capable of performing such  \njobs and the skills as part of such jobs on the basis of  \nplant seniority and then by hiring new employees.  \nAPPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM  \nA. The Apprenticeship qualifications and program es-  \ntablished by the Company shal! be a part of this  \nContract and shall continue in effect. Only employees  \nworking in the bargaining unit will be eligible to bid into  \nthe apprenticeship program.  \nThe following are the maximum periods that an em-  \nployee will remain in an apprenticeship slot, but it is  \nunderstood that such maximum periods may be ex-  \n30  \ntended by mutual agreement of the Company and the  \nUnion:  \nThird Class B Six (6) months  \nThird Class Q Six (6) months  \nSecond Class B Twelve {12} months  \nSecond Class Q Fifteen (15) manths  \nFirst Class B Fifteen (15) months  \nThe above are maximum periods, however, and if, in  \nthe judgment of the Company, an employee has devel-  \noped sufficient skills as to warrant his moving to the next  \napprenticeship slot in craft progression prior to such  \nmaximum time, the Company will move the employee  \naccordingly.  \nB. Bargaining unit employees that desire entrance into  \nthe Apprenticeship Program will sign the bid sheet  \noutlining the basic requirements for entry into the pro-  \ngram and the requirements for successful progression  \nto the status of first class in a particular craft area.  \nApprenticeship vacancies wilt be filled by the plant  \nsenior employees who sign the bid sheet and fulfill the  \nbasic requirements outlined on it. The bid sheet will be  \nposted for thirty (30) days.  \nIn an effort to upgrade craft capabilities the following  \nprocedures will be utilized in Atken's Apprenticeship  \nTraining Program.  \n1. A detailed classroorn and training outline will be  \ndeveloped for each craft apprenticeship training pro-  \ngram.  \n31  \n2. Successful bidders will be expected to take class-  \nroom work, make passing grades in such Classroom  \nwork, and perform satisfactorily on their job training  \nassignments.  \n3. If, at any time prior to earning a qualified first class  \nrating, an apprentice leaves the program for any rea-  \nson, he will return to his previous job with no loss of  \nseniority. Such employee will not hold protected senior-  \nity in the apprenticeship program.  \n4. During a period of cutbacks, apprentices will be  \ncutback before any reductions are made to \u201cQ\" rated  \nfirst class maintenance classifications.  \n5, Apprentices who earn a first qualified maintenance  \nclassification through this program will not be able to  \ndisplace departmental senior first class maintenance  \npersonnel in a period of cutbacks. Apprentices may be  \nassigned to Maintenance periodically for the purposes  \nof training while in a cutback status.  \n6, Employees who bid jobs under the Apprenticeship  \nProgram may be required to attend Technical Schoolan  \naverage of two (2) evenings per week. Such schooling  \nwould be paid for by the Company by way of the  \nCompany's educational refund program.  \n7. Ajoint apprenticeship committee, consisting of three  \n(3) representatives from the Company and three (3)  \nrepresentatives appointed from the bargaining unit, by  \nthe Union, will monitor the Apprenticeship Training  \nProgram.  \n32  \n8. The apprentice training program will be utilized for  \nvacancies in the Maintenance department except for  \nSituations where positions must be filled on an immedi-  \nate basis to meet the operational needs of the Com-  \npany.  \nC. In addition to the craft job classifications listed  \nabove, the Company may utilize the job classification of  \n\u201cchief\u201d within each craft area. Itis recognized, however,  \nthat included in a particular craft area are many and  \nvaried skills. In order for an employee to be eligible to  \nbe awarded a bid to chief in a particular craft area, he  \nmust have demonstrated leadership ability, and by  \nactual on-the-job performance demonstrated that he is  \nfully capable of performing all of the job duties, Skills,  \nand functions of the particular type of work within the  \nCraft area covered by the job in which there is a  \nvacancy.  \nCraft employees who are working in another craft area  \nin their job classification under the Company's training  \nprogram will be eligible to bid for Chief Job tn their own  \nCraft area. This provision will not apply to employees  \nwho have bid into another job classification, bid into  \nanother craft area under the job preference system or  \nhave been cut back from their craft asea or the depart-  \nment. Employees who bid to move under the job  \npreference procedure in the maintenance department,  \nwill not be eligible for a chief job in the new craft area for  \na period of one year.  \nin order to be eligible to be awarded the job of \"chief\" in  \na particular craft area, the senior employee meeting the  \nestablished qualifications will be awarded the job. The  \n33  \nCompany agrees to offer the senior department em-  \nployees in the particular craft area the right for addi-  \ntional training for the purposes of advancement.  \nD. 1. Jobs posted as provided herein will remain posted  \nuntil all shifts on which there could be eligible bidders  \nhave worked one full eight (8) hour shift.  \n2. Employees who are absent from the plant during the  \nentire period during which a job is posted may, upon  \nreturn to work, report to the Human Resources Office  \nand place their name on the job bid sheet provided the  \njob has not already been awarded.  \n3. Permanent vacancies that reoccur within the same  \njob classification within sixty (60) days from the date of  \na job posting for such job classification will not be  \nreposted but will be filled from those who bid on the  \nprevious job bid sheet.  \nE. The Company shall retain its right to make assign-  \nments to machines and places of work within a job  \nclassification as well as shift assignments within a job  \nclassification and there shall be no claim or rights to bid  \non shift assignments other than from a rotating shift to  \na daylight shift and/or locked straight shift jobs within  \nthe same job classification as provided herein and there  \nshall be no claim or right to bid on a different machine  \nor different job assignment within a job classification.  \nDaylight jobs and/or locked straight shift jobs, when-  \never such jobs become available, will be offered to the  \ndepartmental senior employee in the same job classifi-  \ncation within the department in descending order.  \n34  \nF, Any employee assigned to another job classification  \nwithin his own department or another department as a  \nresult of job bidding, promotion or request for transfer  \nwill receive the beginner's rate for such job, unless he  \nhas been previously Q-rated on such job. If such  \nemployee is Q-rated on the new job to which he is  \nassigned within his department, or another department  \nthen he will receive the Q-rate for such job at the time  \nhe begins working on such job and upon accepting such  \njob. The employee will be considered on a trial basis for  \na period of not longer than the period indicated for that  \njob in Appendix B, during which or at the end of such  \ntime the Company will determine whether such em-  \nployee can perform the job. The employee may elect to  \nreturn to his former job during the first fifteen (15)  \nworking days after being placed on the new job, after  \nwhich time the employee will not be allowed to voluntar-  \nily return to his former job. If he cannot perform the job  \nor the employee elects to return to his former job or  \nmove to a lower-rated job, he wilt be ineligible to return  \nto such job for a period of one (1) year except in cases  \nof cutback. An employee on a beginner's rate will be  \nconsidered on a trial basis for a period of not longer than  \nthe period indicated for that job in Appendix B, during  \nwhich time or at the end of such time the Company will  \ndetermine whether such employee has qualified to  \nreceive the Q-rate for the job. If he has so qualified, the  \nemployee will forfeit his right to return to the former job  \nfor one (1) year except in case of cutback and will at that  \ntime begin to receive the Q-rate for the job.  \nDuring such trial period, the Company, at its discretion,  \nmay fill the employee's former job by temporary transfer  \nor by posting such job for bid.  \n35  \nG. An employee filling a job vacancy created by job  \nbidding, promotion or request for transfer will be consid-  \nered as temporarily filling the job until such time as the  \nemployee or Company exercises the option to remain  \non the new job or return to the former job. During such  \ntemporary period, the employee retains his right to  \nreturn to his former job.  \nH. Employees in the Maintenance Department in the  \njob classification of MMM, ELE and UEP who desire to  \nmove from one work area to another will be considered  \nfor such vacancies when they occur, provided they  \nhave made a request in writing to the Maintenance  \nLeader or his designate and are capable of performing  \nsuch jobs.  \n|. The following job classifications may have a \"per-  \nmanent relief.\u201d  \nForming: CPS, MPT, TSY  \nFabrication: TSS, PRA  \nSpecial Fabrication: TSZ, IMX  \nStores: RSA  \nQuality: PQT  \nWarehouse: WAA, ICA, WAC  \nMaintenance: CPX, CPZ, CRY, AMM  \nThe Company will post and award permanent relief jobs  \nin accordance with the Contract provisions. Employees  \nawarded permanent relief jobs wil! have claim to the  \njobs when a permanent vacancy occurs. Department  \nseniority will prevail among employees having claim to  \npermanent openings.  \nJ. who successfully bid a job and subse-  \n36  \nquently get cutback due to a Plant curtailment, and who  \nhave not been Q rated on the new job, will be allowed  \nto return to the job after all Q rated \u201cpermanent\" employ-  \nees have been recalled to that job, before the job is  \nposted again.  \nK. The following jobs will be filed within the plant by a  \njob preference system.  \nFabrication: ABM, EFO, FSR  \nSpecial Fabrication: CRF  \nEmployees who desire moves to these jobs will be  \nSelected to fill openings by Department Seniority from  \nthose employees who have expressed a desire to be  \nconsidered for such jobs in writing in the Human Re-  \nsources Department office. (Plant seniority will be used  \nto determine selection fram those employees having no  \nFab or Special Fab department seniority.) Should  \npreferences exist for these jobs, the Company will fill  \nopenings by hiring new employees. Employees will be  \nallowed no more than two job preferences per calendar  \nyear.  \nSection 11.  \nEmployees assigned to another job within a new de-  \npartment as provided herein and who elect to remain in  \nthe new department as provided above will begin to  \naccrue seniority in the new department from the date  \nthey were awarded the job by bid promotion or assign-  \nment to the job by transfer and their seniority in their  \nformer department will end as of such date and such  \nSeniority in their former department will become their  \nprotected seniority.  \n37  \nSection 12. Temporary Transfers  \nThe Company retains the right to temporarily transfer  \nemployees from one job classification to another or  \nfrom one department to another, however, no employ-  \nees will be transferred temporarily for longer than sixty  \n(60) consecutive calendar days at any one time. For the  \npurpose of such temporary filling of jobs, no employees  \nwill have any right to claim such work. In the event,  \nhowever, such temporary transfers are expected to last  \nordo last longer than sixty (60) days, itis agreed that the  \nCompany will post such jobs and employees within the  \ndepartment may bid to fill such temporary vacancies, it  \nbeing understood that when the employees whose  \nabsence occasioned the temporary transfer return to  \nwork either before or after the sixty (60) day period,  \nthose employees who have been temporarily trans-  \nferred under the provisions provided herein will be  \nreturned to their respective jobs.  \nit is understood that the temporary transfer policy is to  \nbe utilized for such occasions as emergencies, vaca-  \ntions, absentees, training, etc. The Company agrees  \nnot to abuse the temporary transfer agreement and  \nfurther will utilize senior employees whenever possible  \non HIGHER RATED JOBS.  \nOn equivalent paying jobs, or rate groups below equiva-  \nlent paying jobs the Company will utilize junior employ-  \nees who are capable of performing the job whenever  \npossible.  \nOnly those employees working eight (8) hours overtime  \nwithin their own job classification will have preference to  \njob assignments within their job classifications.  \n38  \nSection 13.  \nThe Company shall have the right to make the determi-  \nnation of capability requirements for any job involved  \nunder this Article, including the adoption and use of  \nuniform job-related tests. It is agreed that if there is a  \ndispute as to whether a given employee meets the  \ncapability requirements set out by the Company, the  \nCompany's determination shall control. However, such  \ndetermination may be subject to the grievance and  \narbitration procedures of the Agreement. If the  \nCompany's determination is carried to the grievance  \nand arbitration procedure, the Company's determina-  \ntion will stand unless it is proven that the Company's  \ndetermination was discriminatory or inherently wrong.  \nSection 14.  \nSenior employees within a job classification will be  \nawarded relief jobs on the basis of department seniority  \nproviding they are capable of performing the relief jobs.  \nSection 15.  \nMovement within a job classification will be made for the  \npurposes of operational requirements and will not be  \nmade for disciplinary reasons.  \nSection 16.  \nIn the job classification of EFO the Company will utilize  \nthe junior Q-rated employee when a movement is being  \nmade between the following work areas:  \n1. Surge Lines  \n2. Charge backs and twist breaks  \n3. Regular end finding (Belt).  \nEFO employees may exercise their department, .pro-  \n39  \ntected, or temporary seniority when the Company de-  \ntermines that there is a parmanent vacancy.  \nSection 17.  \nEmployees who are cut back from the WOP in Beaming  \nto a CRF will exit first through the CRF in Beaming  \nproviding they have more department seniority, then  \nthrough the SFU in Multitex, provided the employee  \nwas previously qualified as a CRF or one of the former  \njobs that have been incorporated into the SFU.  \n"], ["ARTICLE 6  \nGRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION  \n", "Section 1.  \nA grievance is hereby defined to be a controversy,  \ncomplaint, misunderstanding or dispute arising out of a  \nclaimed violation of any provision of this Agreement.  \nSuch a grievance involving such claimed violation of  \nany provision of this Agreement shall be taken up  \nbetween the Parties and handled in the following man-  \nner:  \nStep 1: Within three (3) working days following oc-  \ncurrence or first knowledge of the incident or matter  \ncomplained of, the employee(s) may take the matter up  \nwith his appropriate management representative.

If it is  \ndetermined that the employee did not commit the  \noffense then he will be made whole; however, if it is  \nestablished that the employee actually committed the  \noffense, then the discipline in such case will be limited  \nto that which was proposed by the Company during the  \ngrievance procedure prior to arbitration unless it is  \nproven that the discipline imposed was inconsistent  \nwith that imposed on other employees for similar of-  \nfenses under similar circumstances since the effective  \ndate of this Contract.  \n"], ["ARTICLE 8  \nATTENDANCE AND REPORTING OFF  \n", "Section 1.  \nAll employees are expected to work regularly.

Acomplete record of all absences of an employee  \nduring an anniversary year will be noted on an atten-  \ndance record by the appropriate management repre-  \nsentative which will be available for inspection by the  \nemployee.  \nB. For the purpose of this policy, an anniversary year  \nis a year from the anniversary of an employee's plant  \nseniority date through the day before his anniversary  \nthe following year. An \"absence\u201d means the occurrence  \nof an absence whether it be for one day, more than one  \nday. And a reported absence means an absence for  \nwhich an employee has properly reported off prior to the  \nstart of his scheduled shift. From this standpoint and  \nwithin the meaning of this policy, absences on consecu-  \ntive work days will be counted as one absence.  \nC. Times missed from work by reason of jury duty,  \nmilitary service, on-the-job injuries for which the em-  \nployee is entitled to draw Workmen's Compensation,  \nvacations, funeral leave, excused time off for official  \nUnion business as outlined in Article 9, Section 5, or  \nleaves of absence beyond two (2) working days of  \ncompelling and emergency personal reasons, illness,  \ndisability, accident or pregnancy when approved as  \nprovided for in Section 1, Article 9, do not constitute an  \nabsence for purposes of this policy.  \nAT  \nD. Anemployee as provided and defined herein, will be  \nallowed eight (8) occurrences of absence in the period  \nof an anniversary year. After an employee has four (4)  \nreported absences, the appropriate Management Rep-  \nresentative will review with the employee his atten-  \ndance record for the anniversary year and the policy  \nprovided herein for discipline of excessive absentee-  \nism, and the employee will be given written notice with  \na copy to the Union after four (4) call-offs. if the  \nemployee feels the absentees are unjustified, he can at  \nthat time grieve the recorded absentees under the  \ngrievance procedure. If the employee does not grieve  \nthe four (4) absentees, at that time, the absentees will  \nstand as recorded and will not be changed at a later date  \nfor consolidation or any other reason. After an em-  \nployee has had seven (7) reported absences in an  \nanniversary year, the employee will again be inter-  \nviewed by his appropriate Management Representa-  \ntive, his attendance record and this policy will again be  \nreviewed and the employee will be given written notice  \nwith a copy to the union that two (2) more absences in  \nthe same anniversary year will result in his discharge.  \nIf the employee feels the fifth through the seventh  \nabsentees are unjustified, he can at that time grieve the  \nrecorded absentees under the grievance procedure. If  \nthe employee does not grieve the absentees at that  \ntime, the absentees will stand as recorded and will not  \nbe changed at a later date for consolidation of any  \nreason. Employees, in this manner, who occasion nine  \n(9) reported absences in an anniversary year will be  \ndischarged.  \nIn the event an employee receives two (2) written  \nwarnings for absenteeism in two (2) consecutive anni-  \n48  \nversary years, followed by one (1) written warning for  \nabsenteeism in the next (current) anniversary year, the  \nemployee will be given written warning placing him on  \nan Attendance Improvement Program (AIP) stating that  \nthree (3) occurrences of absence during the nexttwelve -  \n(12) months will result in his discharge. Any furloughs or  \nleaves of absence during this period will extend the  \ntwelve (12) month warning period by the equivalent  \nnumber of calendar days away from work.  \nE. Absences on consecutive days which do not involve  \nnon-occupational or occupational accidents, sickness  \nor personal hardship, will count as separate absences.  \nAbsences on consecutive days caused by non-occupa-  \ntional or occupational accidents, sickness or personal  \nhardship will count as one absence.  \nEmployees who report off from work for more than two  \ndays for the same illness or personal hardship, each  \nday thereafter will be counted as a separate occurrence  \nof absence.  \nThe Company recognizes that a limited number of  \nemployees may require consideration for a defined  \npenod of time beyond the normal contractual pravisions  \nregarding absences due to serious medical problems or  \npersonal hardships.  \nIt is the Company\u2019s and the Union's intention to address  \nthese kinds of problems by reviewing the employees  \nrequest for consideration in conjunction with the  \nemployee's past attendance record to determine whether  \nor not future absences related to the above will be  \ncounted as occurrences. In making this decision the  \n49  \nCompany may ask the employee for additional informa-  \ntion of documentation to support the employee's re-  \nquest for consideration, including reporis from  \nthe personal physician. in addition the  \nCompany may require additional physical examina-  \ntians and medical opinions.  \nlt is also recognized that ar employee approved under  \nthis proviston that coniinues to have problems may  \nresult in the Company taking on of the following  \n1} Place on layoff status, 2) Place on medica! Jeave of  \nabsence, or 3) Place on personal! of absence.  \nEmployees will be required to update such requests on  \n@ periodic basis depending on the circumstances or at  \nleast every twelve (12) manths.  \nF. Employees who have accumulated non-consecu-  \ntive absences and have been discharged upon their  \nninth (9) absence wilt not be allowed to combine such  \nabsence with a back-dated Doctor's statement.  \nG. Employees whose absences necessitate forced  \novertime or early call-ins on a continuing basis may be  \ntransferred to another shift, within the same job classi-  \nfication, by the Company, in order to reduce the hard-  \nship imposed on other employees. Such transfer will be  \nby mutual agreement by the Company and the Union.  \nWhen such employee absences are corrected and do  \nnot put hardships on fellow employees, the Company  \nwill move such employee back to his regular shift.  \nH. inthe event that snow and/or ice would prevent fifty-  \none percent (51%) of the employees on any shift from  \n50  \n  \nreporting to work, the absence or consecutive ab-  \nsences will not be counted as a recorded absence.  \nSection 2.  \nAny employee unable to report at his regularly sched-  \nuled work time is required to report off. This notification  \nwill be made no later than one (1) hour prior to his  \nscheduled reporting time.  \nA. When reporting off, an employee will call 649-9911  \nand give the following information.  \nName  \nClock Number  \nDepartment  \nTime scheduled to work  \nReason for reporting off  \nWhen expected to return to work  \noO & WN os  \nB. An unreported absence is defined as an absence  \nwhen the employee fails to report off, as outlined above,  \none hour prior to the start of his scheduled shift, unless  \nthere is justifiable reason for failure to give such notice.  \nIn case of unreported absences, an employee will  \nreceive a verbal warning for the first offense and a  \nwritten warning for the second offense with notice that  \na third offense, within his anniversary year, will result in  \ndischarge. On the third offense, within his same anni-  \nversary year, the employee will be discharged.  \nC. An employee will be allowed to work if he reports to  \nwork within thirty (30) minutes of the start of the shift  \nprovided no one has been held over at the overtime rate  \nto fill his job classification.  \n51  \nSection 3.  \nlf an employee is absent for three (3) consecutive  \nworkdays without reporting off unless there is justifiable  \nreason for failure to report off he will be considered as  \nhaving quit without notice and such em-  \nployee will be terminated.  \nSection 4.  \nAn employee that leaves early four (4) times in an  \nanniversary year may have his record reviewed by  \nappropriate management representative and the Union  \nSteward. The employee will be counseled for leaving  \nearly and written notice of this review will be given to the  \nemployee and to the Union. After this review, employ-  \nees may be given a written warning for each additional  \noccurrence of leaving early under Article 7 of the  \nContract. Three (3) written warnings will result in dis-  \ncharge. Such counseling will remain in effect even  \nthough the employee's anniversary year has turned  \nover, until the problem is corrected. This section will be  \napplied the same for late's.  \nThe Company and Union agree that the intent and  \npurpose of this provision will be applied the same as the  \nLetter of Intent that has been under the past Contract  \nAgreement.  \nSection 5.  \nThe Company willreview employees\u2019 attendance records  \nto insure that the intent of the medical leave benefit is  \nbeing utilized properly. If it is determined by the Com-  \npany that an employee is abusing this benefit, the  \nemployee will be counseled and notified that each  \nadditional leave will count as an.occurrence of absence.  \n52  \nThis provision will be in effect for the remainder of that  \nanniversary year and continuing until the end of the  \nfollowing anniversary year.
