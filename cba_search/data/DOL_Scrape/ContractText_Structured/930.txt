to the employee's home-area local union or District/Regional Council funds even if  
the work-area local union or District/Regional Council funds and the employee's  
home-area local union or District/Regional Council funds are signatory to a UBCJA  
National Reciprocal Agreement. If the Company chooses this option, it shall  
provide sufficient proof to the work-area local union or District/Regional Council  
funds that the appropriate contribution amount has been paid to the employee's  
home-area local union or District/Regional Counci! funds. This option shall not be  
available if the employee's home-area local union or District/Regional Council  
funds refuse to accept such payment. Furthermore, it is expressly understood that  
the Employer will only be required to submit contributions to the above referenced  
funds in the amounts listed in the collective bargaining agreements and/or wage  
addendums where the work is actually performed. This provision is strictly limited  
to the Company's payment of annuity pension and/or health and welfare  
contributions. The Company is obligated to pay dues check-off and all other  
contributions required under the applicable work-area collective bargaining  
agreement to the work-area local union or District/Regional Council.  
The bargaining unit shall also include, for purposes of Pension and Welfare Fund  
contributions only, such persons in the employ of the Employer referred to herein  
as “supervisors”, as that term is defined in the Labor-Management Relations Act of  
1947, as amended, provided that such supervisors:  
(a) has heretofore been included as a member of the "bargaining unit" on any  
basis, under the terms of this collective bargaining agreement, any  
predecessor collective bargaining agreement, or any other collective  
bargaining agreement entered into by this Local Union or District Council, and  
(b) was an employee on whose behalf within the five year period prior to the  
effective date of this Agreement contributions were required to be made or  
were in fact made to the Carpenters Pension Fund of Illinois and Carpenters  
Welfare fund of Illinois, Central Illinois Health & Welfare Fund, Construction  
Industry Welfare Fund, Construction Industry Retirement Fund, Kankakee and  
lroquois Counties Benefit Fund, Southern I!linois Benefits Corporation, Danville  
Carpenters Health, Welfare and Pension Funds, and Construction Workers  
Pension Funds for at least 5,000 hours worked.  
It is expressly understood that the purpose of this provision is limited solely to  
permitting persons who have participated in the aforesaid Pension and Welfare  
Funds as members of the bargaining unit to continue to do so upon their promotion  
to management positions, and is in no respects intended to include such persons  
within the scope of the bargaining unit for purposes of union membership,  
collective bargaining, or any other provisions of this Agreement other than  
provisions governing the payment of pension and welfare contributions.  
It is further understood and agreed that since such supervisors are not subject to  
the wage provisions of this Agreement, and may be paid on a salaried basis,  
contributions on behalf of such persons to the Pension and Welfare funds shall be  
on the basis of 160 hours for each and every month during which such supervisor  
receives any wages from the Employer. |  
It is expressly understood that in the event the Employer is an unincorporated  
partnership or sole proprietorship, any persons who is a pariner or sole proprietor  
of the Employer is ineligible to receive benefits from the Pension and Welfare  
Funds, and no contributions are payable to those Funds on behalf of such persons.  
on the other hand, the Employer is a corporation, persons who happen to own all  
or a portion of the stock of said corporation are of the Employer and  
will be considered as included within the bargaining unit for purposes of wages and  
fringe benefit contributions to the extent that they would qualify as such if they were  
not  
The parties recognize that individuals employed by corporations which are  
employers under this Agreement may perform some work which is covered under  
this Agreement and other work which is not. Some of these empioyees receive  
compensation in such a manner that it is difficult or impossible to determine for  
purposes of fringe benefit contributions the precise number of hours for which  
contributions are payable on their behalf to the Funds, and this uncertainty has  
created a need for uniform and consistent rules which would be fair to all  
concerned. it is therefore agreed that when an employee who is employed by a  
corporation performs both work covered under the terms of this and  
work which is not covered under the Agreement, and if such person Is paid on any  
basis other than at the hourly wage rate specified in this Agreement for ali hours  
worked by such employee in any capacity whatsoever, and provided further that  
such employee is:  
(a) shareholder, officer, and/or director of the corporation, or  
(b) a relative (father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister) of a shareholder,  
officer, and/or director of the corporation.  
The Employer shall be required to make contributions on behalf of such employee  
on the basis of 160 hours for each month in which such employee received any  
compensation from the corporation at the hourly contribution rates established  
elsewhere in this Agreement.  
Within ten (10) days of a request by the Union for a particular project the Employer  
shall obtain and furnish to the Union evidence of a surety bond not to exceed  
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) guaranteeing payment of all fringe  
contributions as set forth in the wage and fringe Addendums attached to this  
Agreement. The Employer shali not cancel or terminate such bond without first  
providing thirty (30) days notice to the Union. Provided, however, that Employers  
who have worked not less than three (3) years in the State of Illinois and have  
made fringe benefit payments in accordance with the terms of this contract for the  
preceding two years shall be exempted from said bonding obligation altogether.  
In the event the Union and/or Trustees are required to file suit by reason of an  
Employer's failure to: (a) maintain his monthly Welfare and Pension contributions  
pursuant to the attached Addendums, and a judgment is rendered in favor of the  
Union and/or Trustees, as part of said judgment, a reasonable amount of the  
attorney's fees and court cost shall be awarded them by the-court. After the Union  
and/or Trustees are awarded said judgment, the Union shall have the right, at its  
option, to require said Employer to furnish a suitable bond with a reputable Surety  
Company guaranteeing his performance, as set forth in this section prior to any  
resumption of the instant agreement with said employer.  
it is agreed that on each anniversary day of any wage addendum to this Agreement  
the Union will have the option of distributing any part of the negotiated increase into  
an existing Health and Welfare and/or Pension Plan or basic wage rate, upon sixty  
(60) days from notice to the Associated General Contractors of Illinois.  
In addition to any contributions otherwise called for herein, the parties agree that  
the Employer shail make a contribution as per the area wage schedule or area  
addendum for each employee covered by this Agreement to the United  
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America National Apprenticeship &  
Training Fund (the "Training Fund"). The parties also agree that the Empioyer shall  
make a contribution as per the area wage schedule or area addendum for each  
employee covered by this Agreement to the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and  
Joiners of America National Health & Safety Fund (the "Health Fund") and the  
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of American Labor Management  
Fund. Payment shall be made to the Training Fund, Health Fund, Labor  
Management Fund, or to such collection agent as is designated by the Training  
Fund, Health Fund or Labor Management Fund on or before the 15th day of the  
month following the month of the work performed. The Employer hereby agrees to  
be bound by the Agreements .and Deciarations of Trust for. the Training Fund,  
Health Fund and Labor Management Fund as they exist and as they may be  
amended or restated, and to such rules, regulations and other governing  
documents adopted pursuant to such Trusts. Upon request, the Employer may  
receive the latest annual report prepared for any or all of the above referenced  
Funds.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the parties agree that during the  
term of this Agreement, with sixty (60) days prior written notice to the Associated  
General Contractors of Illinois, the Union may redirect their contributions to another  
Health and Welfare, Pension or Annuity plan. Provided further, that any increase  
or decrease in the contribution rate shall not take effect until the next wage  
anniversary date at which time a new Wage Addendum shall list the changes, if  
any, in contributions. Because of the restrictions in the I!linois Prevailing Wage Act,  
it is also agreed that the basic wage rate will not be reduced to accommodate any  
changes in the fringe benefit contributions.
