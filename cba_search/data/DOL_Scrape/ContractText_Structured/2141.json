Emergency referrals made outside the designated dispatch hours would also  \nbe made in order, however, applicants who are unavailable or refuse such referrals will  \nnot be penalized.  \nUpon registration, applicants will designate themselves as available for referral within  \ncertain regions. Once an applicant has thus classified him or herself, all penalties  \nregarding refusals and unavailables, for any job in those. regions, will apply. The Union  \nwill be operating with multiple, regional referral lists.  \nIn the event that the Union, trying to fill an Employer's request, has exhausted all  \npossible applicants for referral from that region's list and still requires more workers, the  \noffice may move on to the next, closest list. However, applicants who refuse such  \nreferrals or are unavailable under these circumstances will not be penalized.  \nAll members are required to sign the out of work list according to the county in which  \nthey seek employment.
