inexperienced Laborer  
1. An Inexperienced Laborer is defined as an individual who initially  
starts work as a Laborer after June 1, 1991 and who has worked  
fewer than 600 hours under this Agreement or any other Agreement  
covering building and heavy construction work negotiated by 4  
constituent local of the Laborers’ Internationa! Union of North America  
and who has completed fewer than 240 hours of instruction from the  
Michigan Laborers’ Training Fund.

(75%) of the Construction Laborer’s Gross Wage. An Inexperienced  
Laborer’s Gross Wage shall be allocated so that 100% of the

percent (25%) of the Laborers employed by the Employer on the job.

Laborers, except nonworking foremen and Sweeper/Cleaner Laborers  
shall be counted. To illustrate, after the Employer is employing three  
Laborers on the job, the fourth person may be an Inexperienced  
Laborer. After the additional Laborers (the 5th, 6th and 7th Laborers)  
are employed, the next Laborer may be another Inexperienced  
Laborer. Sweeper/Cleaner Laborers and nonworking foremen cannot  
be included when counting the number of Laborers employed by the  
Emptoyer on the job.

to notify the Union in writing before paying the inexperienced Laborer  
scale of wages, paying the Inexperienced Laborer an incorrect wage  
or by employing Inexperienced Laborers in excess of the maximum  
ratio allowed, the Committee may deny the Employer the privilege of  
using the Inexperienced Laborer scale of wages, for up to one (1)
