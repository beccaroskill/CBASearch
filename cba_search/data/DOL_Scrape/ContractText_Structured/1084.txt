month (the “due date”), irrespective of whether such  
delinquency is willful or otherwise.

they shall also be required to pay, as liquidated dam-  
ages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 10%

particular month (as provided in [a] above), as to  
any or all of the Trust Funds, and if the reports and  
the full payment due for such work month {including  
liquidated damages) are not postmarked in the office  
of the Fund Administrator on or before the 15th day  
of the month following the applicable due date, such

10%. If the report and the full payment for January  
(including the 10% liquidated damages amount) are  
not postmarked before March 16, the Employer  
must then post a bond of $25,000 minimum to a  
maximum amount to be determined by the Fringe

due.  
(e) The delinquent Employer shall also be re-  
quired to pay all costs of collection actually incurred  
by the Trust Fund, including all attorney fees, ser-  
vice fee, filing fees, court reporter fees, and all other  
fees, costs and disbursements, incurred by or on  
behalf of the Trust Funds in collecting the amount  
due. Trustees at their discretion may reimburse  
(from the fund) the Union for picketing and ban-  
nering expense actually incurred by the Union in  
collecting amounts due the Trust Funds, which  
expenses shall be deemed to be costs of collection on  
behalf of the Trust Funds.  
(f) Each Employer who is required to make  
payments to the Trust Funds shall promptly furnish  
to the Trustees and the Union or its authorized  
agent on demand, all necessary employment and  
payroll records relating to its Employees covered by  
this Agreement, including any other relevant infor-  
mation that may be required in connection with the  
administration of the Trust Funds. The Trustees or  
their authorized agents may examine such employ-  
ment, or payroll records whenever such examination  
is deemed necessary in connection with the proper  
administration of the Trust Funds.  
If an Employer fails or refuses to furnish its pay-  
roll records to the Trustees, or their authorized  
16  
agents upon demand or refuses to afford the  
Trustees, or their authorized agents reasonable  
opportunity to examine the same in accordance with  
standard auditing procedures, the Trustees may  
enforce such rights by legal action, in which event  
all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees, court  
reporter fees and other legal costs and disburse-  
ments, as well as the auditing fees and costs  
incurred in conducting such audit, shall be paid by  
such Employer on direction by the Trustees. The  
Union shall also have the right to take economic  
action to enforce such rights on behalf of the Union  
and the Trustees, and the Trust Funds shall reim-  
burse the Union for picketing and bannering  
expenses actually incurred in enforcing such rights.

11 Settlement of Disputes, the failure, refusal or  
neglect of an Employer to report and to pay sums  
due the Trust Funds or otherwise to comply with the  
terms and provisions of this Article shall not be sub-  
ject to arbitration.  
(h) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge  
that the provisions of this Agreement establishing  
rates of pay, wages, all hours of employment and  
other terms and conditions of employment, includ-  
ing fringe benefits, apply to Employees employed in  
job classifications within the jurisdiction of the  
Union, regardless of whether or not such Employees  
are members of the Union.  
6. Any and all fringe contribution rates shall be  
open for adjustment upon thirty (30) days written  
notice to the AGC. Such adjustment shall adjust  
wages in a like amount.
