The Board  \nagrees to give full consideration to the professional background and attainments of applicants for vacancies.  \nIf the SRP is qualified for said position, he/she shall be interviewed by the appropriate supervisor.  \nApplicants shall be notified in writing of the decision by the worksite supervisor.  \nSECTION D - LAYOFF PROCEDURE  \n1.  \nLayoff is defined as the reduction in force for lack of funds or changes in allocation without fault on the part  \nof any employee. Layoffs may occur due to staff reduction at a worksite or the closing of an existing facility.  \nThe Board shall notify the Union immediately upon determination that layoffs must occur.  \n. In case of staff reduction at a worksite, volunteers for layoff will first be sought from among the affected  \nSRP. In the event the number of volunteers is not sufficient, the SRP with the least seniority in the district  \namong those assigned to the worksite at which the reduction must occur within the area of assignment  \naffected shall be laid off first. \"Area of assignment\" shall mean specific job title. Should it become  \nnecessary to reduce the number of Bus Driver/Paraprofessionals at an alternative school for disruptive  \nstudents, the school principal after receiving recommendations from the staff relative to program needs and  \nneeds of students, will determine the SRP to be laid off. SRP selected for layoff and the Union shall be given  \nnotice of the layoff and the reason therefore in writing.  \nIf a school has at least fifteen (15) students speaking the same home language and a Paraprofessional  \n(ESOL/Bilingual) is the only Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) on staff who is  \nproficient in the same home language, then to comply with Florida State Board of Education Rules, Chapter  \n6A-6.0904 (4) (c), the seniority requirement contained in paragraph 2 above relative to the layoff of a  \nParaprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) will be preempted.  \nAn SRP who is laid off under provisions of this section shall be placed on leave without pay for a period of  \ntwelve (12) months. This leave may not be extended beyond one (1) year for any reason.  \nAn SRP who is laid off under provisions of this section shall retain his/her seniority upon recall. Layoff shall  \nnot be considered a break in service if the SRP is recalled under the Recall Procedure, Article VII, Section E.  \nAn SRP who is placed on leave because of layoff shall have the right to unemployment compensation, and  \nnothing contained herein shall be construed to abridge that right.  \nSECTION E - RECALL PROCEDURE  \n1.  \n2.  \nLaid off SRP shall be recalled to their job classification in inverse order of layoff.  \nRecall lists by job title shall be maintained districtwide and positions shall be offered regardless of where  \nthey occur in the district, except that no school or department shall be required to fill more than fifty percent  \n(50%) of its vacant positions by job title from recall lists unless no other vacant positions are available within  \nthe district. At an alternative school for disruptive students, the principal, after interviewing an employee on  \na recall list in which the school has a vacancy, may decline to hire the employee. An employee on a Bus  \nDriver/Paraprofessional recall list will be granted preference in hiring over outside applicants for district  \npositions for which he/she possesses required qualifications provided that no recall lists exist for these  \npositions and there are no laws or regulations which would bar this procedure. A Bus  \nDriver/Paraprofessional who wishes to claim this preference must notify the worksite supervisor and the  \nDistrict Human Resources Office in writing of his/her intentions at the time of application for an advertised  \nvacancy. Failure to make this notification will bar relief through the grievance process in the event  \npreference is not granted. The Union shall be notified of all SRP on the recall list, in order of recall. This list  \nshall be updated whenever there is a change in the SRP sequential recall order.  \nIt shall be the responsibility of each laid off SRP to provide the Board with a telephone number and mailing  \naddress at which he/she can be reached or at which a message may be left during working hours. Telephone  \ncalls for the purpose of recalling SRP shall be made Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. when the  \ndistrict office is in normal operation, based on the twelve (12) month work calendar. The Union shall be  \nprovided with a copy of this calendar.  \nBefore the recall procedure is initiated, the Union shall be notified that a position is being offered to a  \nspecifically named SRP. When a vacancy occurs in a position for which a recall list exists, the Board shall  \nattempt to contact the person at the top of the list by telephone at least three (3) times per day over a three (3)  \nday period and offer the position to the SRP. A busy signal shall not count as an attempt to reach the SRP.  \nIn the event an SRP's telephone is out of order due to no fault of said SRP, the SRP shall be returned to the  \n   \n2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 9  \n"], ["ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  \n", "10.  \ntop of the recall list upon confirmation of this situation.

In the  \nevent a person cannot be reached after following this procedure two (2) additional times, the Board shall be  \nreleased from further recall obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons  \nfrom the employment of the Board.  \nIf a school has at least fifteen (15) students speaking the same home language and there is no  \nParaprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) on staff who is proficient in the same home  \nlanguage, then to comply with Florida State Board of Education Rules, Chapter 6A-6.0904 (4) (c), the  \nseniority requirement contained in paragraph 1 above relative to the recall of a Paraprofessional or  \nInstructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) will be preempted.  \nThe person at the top of the recall list for a specific position vacancy must respond within forty-eight (48)  \nhours of an offer of a position. If the person does not accept that position, he/she shall be placed at the  \nbottom of the recall list. If the SRP declines the second position offered by the Board, except as provided in  \nArticle VII, Section E, paragraph 7, the Board shall be released from further recall obligations, and the  \nperson shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of the Board. It shall be  \nthe obligation of the notified SRP, except in an emergency, to respond to a job offer made under the  \nprovisions of this section. Non-response without cause shall be deemed to be a resignation for personal  \nreasons.  \nWhen an SRP is offered a position at a worksite which is twenty (20) miles further from the SRP's previous  \nworksite, he/she shall have the right to turn down two (2) such offers before being placed at the bottom of the  \nrecall list. When said SRP reaches the top of the recall list again, the Board shall offer him/her the next  \navailable position. If the SRP declines this position, the Board shall be released from further recall  \nobligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of  \nthe Board.  \nWhen an SRP who is a tobacco user and who is on the recall list is offered a position at a smoke and tobacco  \nfree site, he/she shall have the right to turn down the position and shall retain his/her current place on the  \nrecall list. If the SRP who is a tobacco user turns down a position at a smoke and tobacco free site and gives  \nbeing a tobacco user as the reason for turning down the position, he/she shall retain his/her current position  \non the recall list but will no longer be offered positions at other smoke and tobacco free sites.  \nIf, after accepting a position, an SRP does not report to the new position within five (5) working days of the  \noffer being made, the Board shall be released from further recall obligations, and the person shall be deemed  \nto have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of the Board.  \nIf an SRP has not been recalled within twelve (12) months of layoff, the Board shall have no further recall  \nobligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of  \nthe Board.  \nSECTION F - EVALUATION  \n1.  \nPrior to September 15, all SRP shall receive a copy of the assessment instrument, and an explanation of the  \nassessment process shall be provided. In the event an SRP is employed after other SRP have received this  \ninformation, said instrument and explanation shall be given upon employment.  \nThe worksite supervisor or designee making the evaluation shall meet with the SRP to discuss the areas in  \nwhich the SRP's performance is satisfactory, and any area(s) in which the SRP's performance is unsatis-  \nfactory/deficient, or in which the SRP needs improvement.  \nAfter each assessment of an SRP, the SRP or witness shall sign and be given a copy of the assessment  \ninstrument. The signature of the SRP shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the assessment but only  \nacknowledges that he/she has read the report.  \nAn SRP shall be given the opportunity to include his/her comments in writing concerning the assessment  \nreport or, in the case of subparagraph 5 below, any written notification of performance deficiencies. These  \ncomments shall be placed in the SRP's personnel file if the assessment report or, in the case of subparagraph  \n5 below, any written notification of performance deficiencies is placed in the SRP's personnel file.  \nIn the event an SRP is not performing satisfactorily, the worksite supervisor or designee shall advise the SRP  \nin writing of the specific deficiencies in his/her performance and shall give the SRP reasonable time and  \nassistance to overcome these deficiencies. The worksite supervisor or designee will:  \n   \n2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 10  \n"], ["ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  \n", "a) notify the SRP in writing that deficiencies exist,  \nb) provide a full and complete explanation of deficiencies and suggested corrections,  \nc) offer administrative and supervisory assistance, and  \nd) provide reasonable time for correction of deficiencies.  \nThis written notification of performance deficiencies may be accompanied by a completed assessment  \ninstrument.

At any time during this period, beginning with the initial  \nnotification to the SRP that he/she may be subject to involuntary transfer, the Union has the right to represent  \nthe SRP. At an alternative school for disruptive students, the salary of an SRP who is involuntarily  \ntransferred to another worksite shall be no less than he/she would have earned at the alternative school for the  \nremainder of the school year. SRP involuntarily transferred shall not be transferred to a worksite which is  \ntwenty (20) miles further from his/her residence than the alternative school for disruptive students.  \nAll confidentiality of the assessment allowable by law will be granted by the Administration.  \nAll SRP will be evaluated, through the use and completion of an approved assessment instrument, at least  \nonce during the school year. Should a worksite supervisor not meet the date designated by the Human  \nResources Department for the completion of an SRP\u2019s evaluation, the worksite supervisor will inform the  \nSRP of the reason for the delay. If an SRP receives an unsatisfactory evaluation, the SRP has the option of  \nanother evaluation to determine if satisfactory performance has been demonstrated. All evaluations shall be  \nconducted only by worksite supervisors, their designees, or district-level supervisors.  \nAll recommendations regarding continued employment except for positions affected by the layoff procedure  \nshall be based upon information contained in the SRP's personnel file.  \nSECTION G - STAFF DEVELOPMENT  \n1.  \nBy February 1, the worksite supervisor and the SRP building representative will jointly conduct an election  \nof all bargaining unit members at that worksite to elect a representative to coordinate SRP staff development  \nactivities there.

No employee at these sites shall  \nuse any tobacco product in the building(s) or on any outside grounds. This includes the use of such  \ntobacco products in motor vehicles, with the exception of those vehicles entering or exiting the  \nworksite(s).  \nb) A committee shall exist consisting of six (6) members, three (3) representing the Board and three (3)  \nrepresenting the Union, for the purpose of resolving problems that may arise due to the implementation of  \nthe Tobacco Free Policy.  \nAll employees assigned to any School Board facility which is not smoke and tobacco free shall be  \nsurveyed once each year if requested by any employee at the facility. Such request shall be made in  \nwriting by September 30 to the Director of Employee Relations, with a copy provided to the President of  \nthe Union.

Overtime, if any, will be kept to a minimum. However, any Relief Bus Driver who is  \ncalled to work shall be paid for a minimum of two (2) hours.  \nAdvertising for Relief Bus Driver positions will be conducted \u201cin-house.\u201d Should this not result in filling  \nall available Relief Bus Driver positions, advertising will be conducted to attract applicants from outside  \nof the Transportation Department.  \nc) A regular Bus Driver who moves to a Relief Bus Driver position will retain seniority as a Bus Driver.  \nSuch seniority will be retained for purposes of layoff/recall, route bidding on an open position, and route  \nselection if the Relief Bus Driver reenters the selection process prior to the start of the school year. A  \nsingle seniority list will be kept for the group comprised of Bus Drivers and Relief Bus Drivers for these  \npurposes.  \nRelief Bus Drivers will be allowed to reenter the selection process prior to the start of the school year in  \norder to bid for a regular route, according to the procedures as established in the SRP Master Contract,  \nArticle VIII, Section A, paragraph 10. A Relief Bus Driver who wishes to reenter the selection process in  \nthis manner must apply in writing to the Director of Transportation on or before May 15 preceding the  \nstart of a new school year.  \ne) Relief Bus Drivers will be allowed to bid on open routes. However, the Relief Bus Driver may be  \nrequired to remain in the Relief Bus Driver position until his/her replacement is hired.  \nb  \n  \nd  \n\u2014  \nf) Relief Bus Drivers will be afforded the same rights to bid on Summer School routes as are Bus Drivers.  \ng) Relief Bus Drivers can choose to be in the field trip rotation. However, the Relief Bus Driver recognizes  \nthat because of the requirement to keep overtime to a minimum, the opportunity for field trip assignments  \nis diminished.  \nh) Relief Bus Drivers may be used as coaches or to assist in training of new drivers.

Continuous Service Health Leave Benefits  \na) The purpose of this provision is to extend certain insurance benefits to SRP who are not eligible for those  \nbenefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and subsequent language as provided in  \nArticle VIII, Section C, paragraph 7 of the School Related Personnel Master Contract because their work  \ncalendar(s) (days and hours) for the preceding twelve (12) months does not equal 1250 hours or more as  \nrequired for eligibility under FMLA, but who are eligible for Health Leave under Article VIII, Section C,  \nparagraph 5 of the School Related Personnel Master Contract.  \nSpecifically, for this purpose an eligible SRP is one who:  \nk  \n\u2014  \nb  \n\u2014  \n1) has completed ten (10) years of continuous employment by the Board;  \n2) is in an insurance benefit earning position;  \n3) during the twelve (12) month period preceding the unpaid health leave has been in a paid status for at  \nleast 95% of the SRP\u2019s contracted hours. Holidays, earned sick leave, and vacation time for which  \nthe employee has been paid but had not worked shall be included in the calculation of the hours.  \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation, suspension with pay, and Sabbatical Leave for which the employee has been  \npaid will not be included in the calculation of the hours. Sick Leave Bank days for which the  \nemployee has been paid will not be included in the calculation of the hours. Should an SRP apply for  \nHealth Leave and such requested leave immediately follows Sick Leave Bank days which were  \n   \n2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 29  \n"], ["ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  \n", "granted for the SRP\u2019s serious health condition, the twelve (12) month period in which the SRP  \nreceived pay will be calculated prior to the first day of approved Sick Leave Bank; and  \n4) documents that Health Leave is required for the treatment of a serious health condition which prevents  \nthe SRP from performing his/her job. A \u201cserious health condition\u201d means an illness, injury,  \nimpairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:  \na. any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to in-patient care (i.e., an  \novernight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility);  \nb. any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities, of  \nmore than three calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision  \nof) a health care provider; or,  \nc. continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or long-  \nterm health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a  \nperiod of incapacity of more than three calendar days; or for prenatal care.  \nVoluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not \u201cserious health  \nconditions\u201d unless in-patient hospital care is required.  \nc) The twelve (12) month period for entitlement of insurance benefits under this provision will be measured  \nfrom July 1 through June 30.  \nd) Any insurance benefits paid as a result of the approval of days by the Sick Leave Bank under the  \nprovisions of Article VIII, Section B, paragraph 6, will be counted toward the SRP\u2019s annual entitlement  \nof up to twelve (12) weeks of insurance benefits.  \ne) The receipt of insurance benefits as mentioned in this provision is subject to the following restrictions and  \nprivileges:  \n1) The Board shall require the SRP to obtain and to furnish to the Board the necessary documentation of  \na serious health condition as described in paragraph b) 4) b, and c of this provision.  \n2) The Board may request that the SRP provide additional verification of a serious health condition at  \nany reasonable interval.  \n3) The Board retains the right to implement reasonable rules and regulations with regard to the approval  \nof benefits based on a claim of a serious health condition. This includes but is not limited to requiring  \na second opinion, at the Board\u2019s discretion, from a Board-paid doctor with regard to a medical  \ncondition, and the use of forms for requests for leave, physician documentation, and fitness to return  \nto work.  \n4) In the event that the Board exercises its right to a second medical opinion and the opinion conflicts  \nwith the first doctor\u2019s opinion in the medical certification, then a third opinion may be required by a  \nBoard-paid physician mutually agreed upon by the Board and SRP. This third opinion will be final  \nand binding upon the Board and the SRP.  \n5) Board-Paid Insurance Benefits  \nFor SRP who are eligible for continuous service health leave benefits, the Board will pay the portion  \nof the insurance premium which it normally paid prior to the leave, such as major medical, surgical,  \ndental, life, and flexible benefits. The cost of these benefits will be paid by the Board based on the  \nexpectation that the SRP will return to work following the approved Health Leave. Return to work  \nmeans that the SRP must return to work for at least thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion  \nof approved Health Leave or following the conclusion of other approved leave which is granted under  \nArticle VIII, and which is immediately subsequent to the Health Leave. Noncontracted days during  \nsummer break and unpaid holidays during winter and spring break will not be used in calculating the  \nthirty (30) calendar days. If the SRP does not return to work for the Board after approved leave, the  \nBoard shall take necessary steps to recover the Board\u2019s share of the health premium payments made  \non the SRP\u2019s behalf during a period of unpaid Health Leave unless:  \na. the SRP\u2019s position has been affected by reduction in force and/or layoff,  \nb. the SRP has a continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle  \nthe SRP to additional health leave, or  \n   \n2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 30  \n"], ["ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  \n", "c. other circumstances beyond the SRP\u2019s control.

This provision shall not prohibit the Board from paying additional retirement bonuses provided for in this  \nAgreement or future bonuses agreed to by the Board and the Union.  \n3.

If an employee chooses one of these aforementioned early retirement options, the Board will have no further  \nobligation toward his/her retirement benefits.  \n5. SRP who select one of these aforementioned early retirement options are required to retire from the Florida  \nRetirement System (FRS) and terminate their employment with the district. Therefore, such SRP are not  \neligible to participate in the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) as the DROP requires an SRP to  \nretire from the FRS yet continue to work within the district.  \nSECTION E \u2014- DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PROGRAM (DROP)  \n1. Effective July 1, 1998, employees who qualify for the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) may  \nelect to participate in that program as provided by the procedures set forth by the district and by Florida  \nStatute 121.091. An employee\u2019s salary, benefits, terms, and conditions of employment as specified in this  \nAgreement will remain in full force during the employee\u2019s participation in DROP.

The 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and the Employer Paid 403(b) Plan allows participating employees to  \ndefer federal income tax and permanently avoid the payment of Social Security tax and Medicare tax on  \neligible plan contributions.  \n7.

For SRP who retire after January 1, 1997, and who were eligible for insurance benefits at the time of  \nretirement, the Board agrees to contribute the same amount toward the retiree\u2019s health premium each year as  \nit does toward the premium of a regular employee. The contribution will begin upon retirement and continue  \nuntil the retiree is eligible to receive Medicare benefits.  \n2.
