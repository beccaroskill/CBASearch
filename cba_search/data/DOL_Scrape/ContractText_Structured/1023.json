Upon receipt of written  \nauthorizations signed by the employee, the trustees shall deduct such sums as are payable  \nas working dues from Vacation Fund contributions for said employee received by the  \ntrustees prior to depositing such contributions into the Vacation Fund.  \n(b) For any employee who has not executed an authorization for the assignment of  \nworking dues, the Fund will, on request, remit to the employee at regular intervals at such  \ntimes as determined by the trustees, such a sum as would be remitted to the Union if such  \nan authorization had been executed by the employee.  \n(c) The authorization for the assignment of working dues shall be irrevocable for the  \nperiod of one (1) year, or until the termination of this collective bargaining agreement,  \nwhichever period is less, unless written notice is given by the employee to the trustees of  \nthe Fund not more than seventy-five (75) days before any periodic renewal date.  \n(d) The Union shall indemnify and save each Employer, the Association, and any  \nAssociation trustee harmless against any duplication of payment and any and all claims,  \ndemands, suits or other forms of liability that may arise out of or by reason of action taken  \nby or not taken by the Employer, the Association or any Association trustee for the purpose  \nof complying with this Section, provided, however, the Union shall not be responsible for  \nany liability caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the Employer or  \nthe Association.  \n"], ["ARTICLE Il  \nWages and Fringe Benefit Contributions  \n", "1.
