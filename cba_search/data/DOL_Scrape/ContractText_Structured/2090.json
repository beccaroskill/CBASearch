In the application of seniority principles, the  \nCompany will give preference to seniority if other factors are substantially equal. For  \nseniority to be applicable, the employee involved must have the ability, physical fitness,  \ndependability and qualifications to perform the work involved.  \n4.2 Seniority is defined as the length of time since the last date of hiring by the  \nCompany or by all predecessor contractors at Vance. Employees who are transferred or  \npromoted out of the bargaining unit and who return to the bargaining unit within six months  \nwill do so without loss of seniority via the bidding procedure in Article 4 to available openings.  \n4.3. Every new employee shall be a probationary employee for a period of ninety (90)  \ncalendar days from the date he/she first reports for work and during said probationary period  \nhe/she may be discharged at any time at the sole discretion of the Company and shall not  \nhave recourse to the grievance procedure or to arbitration. Probationary employees will not  \nbe eligible to bid on posted job openings.  \n4.4 Inthe event of a layoff the Company shall designate the number of employees to  \nbe laid off in each job classification, and in each such job classification the employees with  \nleast seniority shall be laid off first. An employee who is designated to be laid off or who Is  \nbumped may bump a less senior employee in his/her line of progression, but in no event can  \nan employee bump a higher classified employee than themselves. Bumping rights must be  \nexercised within 48 hours after an employee is notified that a layoff will take place. An  \nemployee who is bumped to a lower job classification will receive the maximum rate of his/her  \nnew job classification or his /ner previous rate of pay, whichever is less.  \n4.5 Following any layoff, as employees are needed for recall they shall be recalled in  \nreverse order to the order in which they were laid off. An employee who has bumped to a  \nlower job classification in lieu of layoff will be offered recall to his/her previous job  \nclassification only one time. If he/she declines the offer he/she will not have further recall  \nrights to his/her said previous job classification. When an employee returns to his/her  \nprevious job classification the employee shall receive his/her previous rate of pay plus any  \ngeneral wage increases and/or longevity wage increases they would have received if the  \nlayoff had not occurred.  \n4.6 Employees who are in layoff status and accept a full time job with the Company  \nout of their line of progression shall forfeit all recall rights under paragraph 4.5 but shall retain  \nall seniority and other benefits accrued prior to layoff.  \n4.7 returning to full time jobs out of their line of progression as set forth in  \nparagraph 4.6 shall acknowledge their forfeiture of recall rights under paragraph 4.5 by  \nsigning a statement to that effect on a form provided by the Company.  \n4.8 Anemployee's seniority shall be terminated, and he/she shall cease to have any  \nrights under this article, in the following situations:  \n(a) lf the employee resigns or is discharged or accepts employment outside  \nthe bargaining unit covered by this agreement.  \n(b) lf the employee fails to respond to a written notice of recall within five work  \ndays of receipt.  \n(C) If the employee fails to inform the personnel department of changes of  \naddress while he/she is on layoff.  \n(d) lf the employee is absent for three consecutive working days without  \nreporting a reason sufficient to justify his/her absence. (Job Abandonment)  \n(e) If the employee is on layoff or on leave of absence for two years.  \n4.9 \"Qualified\" and \"qualified to perform the work\" as used in this agreement shall  \nmean possession of the required experience, if any, and required training, if any, and the  \nability to perform satisfactorily the required duties of the job and to meet standards of quantity  \nand quality without the need of extensive training. In job classifications involving the storage  \nor movement of property, employees must have the physical strength to frequently lift and  \ncarry large and cumbersome items and items up to 40 pounds.  \n4.10 Relative seniority for employees with the same hire date will be determined by the  \nlast four digits of each employee's Social Security number, i.e. the lowest number has the  \nmost seniority.  \n4.11 When a job becomes vacant and is needed to be filled, it will be posted for three  \nworking days, except that temporary jobs will not be posted. Any employee, except  \nprobationary employees, whether or not in the line of progression may sign or electronically  \nsign the job posting notice in accordance with paragraph 4.14. Preference will be given in  \nfilling the posted job, except as provided in paragraphs 4.12 to the senior employee in the line  \nof progression, who is qualified to perform the work and who has signed the posting notice  \nbefore the close of the posting period. If the job is not filled by an employee in the line of  \nprogression, it will be awarded to the senior qualified bidder outside the line of progression.  \nAn employee in the line of progression in which the vacancy is posted, who has been on sick  \nleave throughout the posting period and returns to work within three working days after the  \nclosing date, or who is on vacation throughout the posting period, may claim the posted  \nvacancy within 24 hours after returning from vacation or sick leave, if it has been awarded to  \na less senior employee in the line of progression or to an employee outside the line of  \nprogression and if he is qualified to perform the work. An employee on sick leave or  \nauthorized absence will be allowed to have his/her name added to the posting during the  \nposting period. This can be accomplished by a phone call to the Human Resources office or  \nby signing a posting at one of the locations on base.
