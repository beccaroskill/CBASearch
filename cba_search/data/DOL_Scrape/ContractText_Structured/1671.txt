resolved in the following manner; each of the steps hereinafter listed shall be initiated by the parties in sequence as  
set forth:  
(1) The Employer shall assign work on the basis of traditional craft jurisdictional lines. Jurisdictional  
assignments shall be made on the basis of Agreements of record, established trade Agreements and  
prevailing area practices.  
(2) All questions, complaints or disputes dealing with craft jurisdiction shall be referred to the business  
representatives of the Unions involved in the jurisdictional disputes and to the Employer’s authorized  
representatives, who shall then meet at a location acceptable to all parties.  
(3) Jurisdictional disputes which cannot be resolved at the Local level shall be referred to the International  
Unions involved for a determination. Pending such determination, the work will continue as assigned by the  
Employer. Any determination made pursuant to this provision shall be final and binding on the disputing  
Unions and the involved Employer on this project only. Such a determination shall not establish a precedent  
on other projects.  
Section 3. There shall be no stoppage of work or slow down by employees, or lockout by the employer, during the  
implementation of the above procedure for the settlement of jurisdictional disputes between crafts.

### ARTICLE XXXI  
### MARKET PRESERVATION  
### 
The Business Agent, with the approval of the District Council Business Manager, shall have the authority to make  
contract concessions during the term of this Agreement. Any such concessions or modifications shall be granted on  
a project by project basis only.  
When concessions are granted by the Business Agent, with the approval of the District Council Business Manager,  
the following procedure shall be strictly adhered to:  
Step 1: Any individual Employer or Employers signatory to this Agreement may request contract concessions for a  
specific project. Such a request shall be directed to the appropriate Business Agent who shall, as appropriate, grant  
concessions and modifications necessary to assure continued work opportunities for employees.  
Step 2: Once a Business Agent(s) agrees to contract concessions the individual Employer(s) requesting the  
adjustment shall be immediately notified. The Union(s) shall also immediately notify the Association(s) having the  
bargaining rights for the Employer(s) who originally requested the modification. Notification of the Association  
shall be confirmed in writing as soon as practicable.  
Any concessions which are granted must be transmitted to the appropriate individual Employer(s) and  
Association(s) no later than two (2) working days prior to bid opening. Such concessions shall initially be  
transmitted to the appropriate Association(s) by telephone. However, as noted above, they must be confirmed in  
writing as soon as practicable.  
Step 3: Any concessions or adjustments granted for a specific project shall be available to all signatory Employers  
interested in the project. It shall, however, be the responsibility of the individual Employers to request information  
regarding any possible adjustments from the Association Office in his/her area. To insure that all individual  
Employers have equal access to contract concession information, the Employer Associations shall serve as a  
clearing house for information regarding contract concessions.  
Any wage adjustments granted as a part of concessions for a specific project shall be established on a percentage of  
the base wage rate. Fringes, contributions, shall continue to be paid as provided in the Collective Bargaining  
Agreements. ~
