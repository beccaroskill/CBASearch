of forces seniority based on the following shal] govern.  
Length of continuous service and ability to perform the work.  
(b) Temporary work assignments, except as otherwise provided by  
agreement, for any cause other than absenteeism may be made  
by the Company to suit operating requirements not to exceed one day;  
provided, however, that consideration shail be given to the employee  
with the greatest seniority and he shal! be so assigned if practicable. For  
any such assignments beyond this period, seniority shall] govern.  
Section 2. Continuous Service.  
(a) It is understood and agreed that wherever the word “seniority” is  
used in this Section, it refers to length of service and ability to perform  
the work.  
{b) For the purpose of this Article, continuous service shal] be  
designated as continuous service within the plant.  
(c) The term “continuous service” shall mean an employce's total  
elapsed time from date of employment to date of termination and shall  
be calculated in accordance with Section 4 of this Article and shall  
include adjusted continuous service for employees who were employed  
on June I, 199! and who had been credited with prior service as of that  
date.  
(d) When an employee accepts an occupation which comes under the  
jurisdiction of another recognized bargaining unit, all seniority service  
credit which the individual has accumulated is permanently forfeited.  
Section 3. Application of Seniority.  
(a) It is understood and agreed that wherever the word “seniority” is  
used in this Section, it refers to length of service and ability to perform  
the work.  
(b) In the application of seniority within the department in cases of  
promotion, demotions, layoffs, transfer and recall to employment in a  
department, seniority shall govern.  
(c) Permanent vacancies (openings resulting from a quit, retirement  
or expansion of the work force) shall be filled on the basis of plant  
26  
Seniority within the department. An employee is allowed one successful  
bid to a job in the same or a lower pay class each three month period.  
There is no limit to the number of successful bids an employee may  
have to higher paying jobs or from non-incentive to an incentive job.  
A successful bidder wil] be given a reasonable training period not to  
exceed 5 work days.  
(d) An employee may request transfer as a Laborer to any other  
department by signing the Transfer Request Book in the Personnel  
Department. Transfers will be made on the basis of plant seniority and  
will be limited to one per three month period. A transferred employee  
will be given a reasonable training period not to exceed 5 work days.

period of six months.

reverse order departmental seniority from the higher to the lower jobs.  
Employees whose jobs are being eliminated may bump to any job they  
have pete as a permanent assignment or to any job in the lower four  
pay classes within their department. An employee whose departmental  
seniority is insufficient to retain him in his department may bump into  
any job in the plant which he has previously held or to any job in the  
lower four pay classes to which his seniority entitles him, An employee  
who elects to bump into another department must exercise his right  
immediately upon being notified that his seniority will not hold in his  
regular department, An employee, who bumps into another department  
in accordance with the above, will continue to accrue seniority in his  
prior department and shall be considered to be in the new department on  
the basis of a temporary transfer. A temporarily transferred employee  
will be ranked behind all permanent employees in the department for the  
purposes of promotion and overtime assignments (except in cases of “if  
the job works-the man works”),  
If no employee desires a particular promotion or overtime assignment  
the least senior qualified permanent department employee must accept  
the assignment.

of departmental seniority from the lower to the higher jobs. Any  
vacancies remaining after all employees with departmental seniority are

department before new employees are hired.  
(h)Temporary work assignments resulting from absence of any  
cause, of 30 days or less may be made by management to suit operating  
requirements; provided, however, that consideration shall be given to  
the employee with the greatest seniority, and he/she shall be so assigned  
if practicable.  
(i) Temporary vacancies of over 30 consecutive work days resulting  
from any cause shall be filled on the basis of plant seniority within  
the department from among qualified employees who have signed the  
“Occupational Request Register” within the department. If no employee  
has requested temporary assignment to the vacancy, it shall be filled in  
accordance with paragraph (g) above.

Seniority Rights.

during such absence for two years and for an additional period  
equal to (1) three years, or (2) the excess, if any, of his tength  
of continuous service at the commencement of such absence over  
two years, whichever is less. Any accumulation in excess of two  
years during such absence shall be counted, however, only for the  
purposes of this Article 13 and shall not be counted for any other  
purpose under this or any other agreement between the Company  
and the International Union or local union. In order to avoid a  
break in service after an absence of two years, the employee must  
give the Company annual written notice that he intends to retum  
to employment when called, if the Company at least 30 days prior  
thereto has mailed him a notice at his last address on the Company  
records that he must file such notice.

of employment.  
29  
(b) A probationary employee may be terminated at any time at the  
discretion of the Company, and such termination shall not be subject to  
the Grievance and Discharge procedures. The Union may file grievances  
on their own behalf as regards rates of pay or working conditions in  
connection with probationary employees. There shall be no obligation  
on the part of the Company to reemploy a probationary employee who  
is discharged, laid off, or who resigns during such 90 day period.

Injuries.

work due to occupational disease or injury, the Company will retum  
him to work when he is physically fit to resume work, provided such  
employee would, under conditions then prevailing, be so employed by  
the Company. Further, the parties agree that restricted duty personne!

keeps within their restrictions. Upon returning to work the employee  
will be given credit for the time lost for the purpose of seniority.

will be given to the applicant with the greatest plant seniority and the  
ability to perform the work. The applicant will be afforded a reasonable

transferring employee quits, transfers, is disqualified, etc. prior to the  
transferring employee being transferred, the period of time held on job

30  
1995 will be required to remain on the Chipper job for a period of not
