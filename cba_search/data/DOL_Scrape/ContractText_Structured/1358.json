It will also include all inland waters, rivers, and  \nlakes, natural and/or man-made, within the boundaries of the State of Alaska.  \nIt is understood further that by the above listing, the jurisdiction of the Union over diving  \nwork is not thereby limited to that area. The Union claims jurisdiction over diving in  \ncertain areas beyond that covered by this Agreement i.e., oceanographic and/or research  \nvessels, seismographic and/or other vessels either temporarily or permanently based and  \noperated out of ports in the State of Alaska, engaged in petroleum research, offshore  \nmining, fisheries research, and all other types of oceanographic and marine research  \nand/or experimental work requiring the use of divers. This also pertains to any sort of bell  \ndiving using deck decompression chambers with submersible diving chambers.  \nSection 2. Work Claimed  \nThe following work is claimed by the Union: submarine diving in all its branches and  \nphases, such as the salvaging of all ships, vessels and barges, etc.; the underwater repair,  \nremoving, dismantling, demolition, burning and welding in all marine salvage operations;  \nall underwater construction and reconstruction, and the salvage of and removing of  \nunderwater structures; underwater inspections and repairs of hulls, docks, bridges, and  \ndams, underwater pipelines, sewage and water systems, underwater suction and discharge  \nlines such as those used at chemical plants, pulp mills, and desalination plants;  \ninspecting, surveying, removing, rescuing and recovering of all objects below water  \nsurface; all underwater work necessary on offshore oil platforms, permanent or  \ntemporary, including all floating drill rigs and jack-up platforms; all underwater well  \ncompletions; all underwater work on pipelines and hookups including petroleum, gas,  \nwater and sewage systems; the laying of underwater power or communication cables;  \nmarine mining and dredging operations using divers in any phase of their work seeking  \nminerals and/or precious metals, etc.; all petroleum, fisheries, oceanographic, research  \nand experimental work where the use of divers is necessary; all underwater demolition  \nand blasting work requiring the use of divers; the operation of remotely operated  \nvehicles, single atmosphere diving suits, one atmosphere bells and self-propelled manned  \nsubmersibles.

The use  \nof an Assistant Tender may be omitted, when it is mutually agreed between the  \nEmployer, Union, and the Diver involved. The Standby Diver shall be completely  \ndressed in prior to dive but may take off helmet and weigh belt only.  \nW hen working on structures, pipelines or exploratory rigs in Cook Inlet, the  \ndiving crew shall consist of no less than six workers, two divers, two tenders and  \ntwo assistant tenders. W ork on vessels and docks in Cook Inlet may be an  \nexception, with a four person crew being allowed upon mutual agreement of the  \nDiver and Employer.  \nb.

Anexception to paragraph (b): When divers are engaged in construction or  \nmaintenance work where there is a crew of Piledrivers Riggers working, the  \nAssistant Tenders may, at the discretion of the Employer, be taken from the  \nregular Piledriver rigging crew and assigned to the divers and tenders for a period  \nof time that divers are on the job. However, the person assigned in this case as  \nAssistant Tender must meet the approval of the divers and must be taken only  \nfrom the Piledrivers Rigging Crew, and be qualified as Assistant Tenders. When  \nPiledriver riggers are taken from a rigging crew to act as Assistant Tenders, it is  \nunderstood and agreed that they are relieved of their duties with the ngging crew  \nuntil such time as the divers have completed their required work.  \nDuring this time, Assistant Tenders will not operate air tuggers or perform any  \nrigging or other work that takes them away from their immediate duties of  \nAssociated General Contractors of Alaska and the Alaska Regional Council of Carpenters  \nCollective Bargaining A greement  \nPage 31 of 39  \nassisting the Diver and their Tender.

No worker shall return to a straight time pay basis under these  \ncircumstances until they have had eight (8) consecutive hours off.  \nA Tender shall not tend more than one Diver simultaneously, except in  \nemergency.  \nThe Diver's Tender must remain on the job during the entire decompression  \nperiod.  \nNo member of a diving crew shall be permitted to receive compensation on a  \npiece work basis.  \nIt is agreed that there shall be no contract diving unless the contracting Diver shall  \nfurnish all diving gear, tenders, and insurance required, and they are also required  \nto comply with all the requirements, conditions and intents of this Diving Section,  \nAssociated General Contractors of Alaska and the Alaska Regional Council of Carpenters  \nCollective Bargaining A greement  \nPage 32 of 39  \nand requirements, conditions and intents of the Master A greement between the  \nUnion and the Employer, of which this Section is a part.  \nSection 5.

Divers shall be guided by the latest available U.S. Navy Standard Air  \nDecompression Tables and other appropriate diving tables, for decompression.  \nb. Copies of the appropriate U.S. Navy table shall be available at the job site.  \nc. Only one optimum dive within a 12 hour period will be permitted. Optimum time  \nshall be defined as being in the \"0\" repetitive group, using the latest edition of the  \nU.S. Navy diving tables.  \nSection 10. Warnings  \na. In navigable waters of the U.S., flags and lights shall be displayed in accordance  \nwith the requirements outlined in \"Rules of the Road\" Published by the U.S.  \nCoast Guard. A traditional Flag\" should be displayed at the diving  \nlocations, in addition to others required, where power boats may be expected to  \nenter the area. A traditional Flag\" is identified as a white transverse stripe  \non a rectangular red field.  \nb. Protection of Diving Area. If necessary, buoys should be anchored around the  \nwork area and the area roped off so as to keep unauthorized surface craft out of  \nthe immediate vicinity.  \nSection 11. Divers Wage  \na. The Diver shall receive a minimum of eight hours pay for any day, or part thereof  \nat the appropriate rate regardless of the type of work performed or assigned by the  \nEmployer and coming within the jurisdiction of Local Union 2520.  \nAssociated General Contractors of Alaska and the Alaska Regional Council of Carpenters  \nCollective Bargaining A greement  \nPage 34 of 39  \n. The standby rate applies only when no dive is made within the 8-hour shift. When  \na dive is made, the Diver shall receive double the standby rate regardless of how  \nmany times the Diver comes to the surface. This is the \"wet\" pay rate. The dive  \nshall constitute eight hours minimum.  \n1) The Standby Diver shall receive piledrivers scale plus 12 and % percent plus  \none ($1.00) dollar per hour.  \n2) If used the Diving Foreman shall received 12 and 2 percent above the  \nStandby Diver scale.  \n3) If used the General Diving Foreman shall receive 25 percent above the  \nStandby Diver scale.  \n. Any time the Diver spends within a decompression chamber after the regular shift  \nshall be paid for at the same rate as diving.  \n. When a diving crew has a work or standby day offshore, such as when confined  \non a platform or vessel, there is a minimum of 12 hours per day pay at the  \napplicable rates. For onshore standby there is a minimum of 8 hours per day pay  \nat the applicable rates.  \n. Cook Inlet Tide Work.  \nCook Inlet tide work is a special situation.

An exception to this is that when a crew is based  \nonshore an 8 hour minimum for working one tide or standing by is acceptable. All  \nhours worked after 8 hours, or time worked on Saturdays, on Sundays, and on  \nHolidays, shall be at the applicable rate of overtime. The diving crew must have 8  \nhours offshift before they return to a straight time rate.  \nComputing Divers \"Wet\" Pay For Cook Inlet  \nFor Cook Inlet tide work a Diver will receive 8 hours \"wet\" pay at the straight  \ntime rate for a dive in either or both the first and/or second tide of a shift.

If they dive either or both the first and/or second tides and either the third or  \nforth tides, they gets 8 hours straight time and 8 hours overtime at the \"wet\" rate.  \nDiving 4 tides is 24 hours of \"wet\" pay, 8 hours Straight time and 16 hours  \novertime.
