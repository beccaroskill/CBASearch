If the withdrawal penalty and/or Social Security and Medicare tax rates change, the Board and Union  \nagree to renegotiate the reimbursement rate. If a fee is charged to process the IRS 1099 form, the Board will  \nreimburse these same employees the one-time administrative fee.  \n10.

The contribution will begin  \nupon retirement and continue until the retiree receives Medicare benefits or until twenty-four (24) months  \nhave elapsed from the date of retirement, whichever comes first.  \nThis condition is contingent upon the retiree meeting all of the following conditions:  \na) the teacher must have completed at least ten (10) years of creditable service under the Florida Retirement  \nSystem (FRS);  \nb) the teacher must have completed at least ten (10) years of service in the district;  \nc) the teacher must be approved for full disability retirement under FRS and have provided the district with  \nproof of application for full disability retirement under the Social Security Administration;  \nd) the teacher must contribute his/her health insurance subsidy received from the State of Florida toward the  \ncost of the health premium; and  \ne) continues to participate in a Board-sponsored health plan after his/her retirement.  \nSECTION G - Meritorious Attendance Incentive Pay  \n1.
