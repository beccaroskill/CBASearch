Carmel, operated by the Employer, excluding those  \nstores specified under another agreement.  \nIn addition to the bargaining unit described in the Agreement  \nabove, the Employer, to the extent permitted by law, agrees to recognize the  \nUnion as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for employees employed at  \nany additional store which the Employer may hereafter establish in any  \ngeographical area assigned to Local 23 by the United Food and Commercial  \nWorkers International Union, but excluding the convenience stores as  \nprovided in Article 1.1 below; however, that recognition shall be extended  \nonly in each such additional store for which Local 23 presents the Employer  \nwith signed authorization cards or membership applications authorizing Local  \n23 to represent the majority of the employees in each such additional store.  \nWITNESSETH:  \nThat in consideration of the mutual and reciprocal promises herein  \ncontained the Employer and Union covenant and agree as follows:  \nARTICLE 1 - Purpose and Intent:  \n1.1 This Agreement is for the exclusive joint use and benefit of  \nthe contracting parties as defined and set forth herein. It is the intent  \nand purpose of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall promote and  \nimprove industrial and economical relationships and to set forth herein  \nbasic agreements covering rates of pay, hours of work and conditions of  \nemployment and shall cover the persons employed in any store owned or  \noperated by the Employer. This contract excludes convenience stores with  \nnine (9) or less employees.  \n1.2 It is mutually understood that the terms and conditions of  \nemployment relating to the employment of the workers covered by this  \nAgreement have been decided upon by collective bargaining. This Agreement  \nmay be modified only by mutual consent, in writing by the parties hereto.  \n1.3 It is the intent of this Agreement to reserve to the Employer  \nthe right to employ and to except from the provisions of the same an  \nadequate force of supervisory employees to conduct the safe and efficient  \noperation of its units and at the same time to provide against the abuse of  \nsuch reservation by limiting use of same employees to such employees as may  \nbe reasonably required for that particular purpose.  \n1.4 Wherever \"he\" is used in this Agreement, it is intended to  \nmean he or she, or vice versa.  \n1.5 In further consideration of the mutual promises contained  \nherein, the parties hereto expressly agree that neither party shall bring or  \ncause to be brought any court or other legal or administrative action  \nagainst the other until the dispute, claim, grievance, or other shall have  \nbrought to the attention of the party against whom it shall be made and  \nthe said party given actual notice of the same.  \n1. ARTICLE 1 - Purpose and Intent (Continued):  \n1.6 This Agreement shall supersede all existing and previous  \ncontracts and all local rules, regulations and customs heretofore  \nestablished in conflict with this Agreement. Prior practices and customs  \nnot in conflict with this Agreement may be continued.  \n1.7 This Agreement covers the entire understanding between the  \nparties hereto.  \nARTICLE 2 - Recognition:  \n2.1 The Employer recognizes the United Food and Commercial Workers  \nas the exclusive bargaining agent for all employees engaged in employment  \ncovered by this Agreement, and it will be a condition of employment that all  \nemployees hired will be members of the United Food and Commercial Workers  \nUnion after thirty (30) calendar days employment with the Employer.  \n2.2 Demo employees who work sixteen (16) hours per week for four  \n(4) consecutive weeks are covered by this agreement and all terms of the  \nagreement apply.  \nARTICLE 3 - Union Shop:  \n3.1 It shall be a condition of employment that the employees in  \nthe bargaining units covered by this Agreement, who are members of the Union  \nin good standing on the execution date of this Agreement, shall remain  \nmembers in good standing, and those who are not members on the execution  \ndate of this Agreement, shall, on the thirty-first (31st) day following the  \nexecution date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing  \nin the Union. Employees hired during the terms of this Agreement, shall, as  \na condition of continued employment, become members no later than the  \nthirty-first (31st) day from the initial date of hire.  \n3.2 The requirement of membership in the Union shall be satisfied  \nupon payment or tender of payment by the employee of the amount of  \ninitiation fees, regular or periodic dues, and assessments uniformly  \nrequired by the Union as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.  \n3.3 The Employer shall be obligated to terminate the employment of  \nany employee covered by this Agreement by reason of his or her failure to  \nobtain or maintain membership in the Union as required by this Article 3  \nupon receipt of a written request by the Union for such termination. Such  \ntermination shall be effective no later than fourteen (14) calendar days  \nfrom the receipt of such notice; it being understood, however, that the  \nEmployer shall have the right to refuse such request if it has reasonable  \ngrounds to believe (1) that such membership is not available to the employee  \non the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or;  \n(2) that membership has been denied or terminated for reasons other than the  \nfailure of the employee to tender periodic dues and initiation fees  \nuniformly required as a condition of obtaining or retaining membership.  \n3.4 The Union agrees to indemnify and save the Employer harmless  \nagainst any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that  \narise out of or by reason of any action taken by it in reliance on any  \ndirection by the Union under this Article 3, and Article 4 below for the  \npurpose of complying with the provisions of each Article, unless Employer  \nneglect is proven.  \nARTICLE 3 - Union Shop (Continued) :  \n3.5 The Employer will not interfere with the rights of its  \nemployees to become members of the Union. There shall be no discrimination,  \ninterference, restraint, or coercion by the Employer or any of its agents  \nagainst any employee because of membership in the Union.  \nARTICLE 4 - Checkoff :  \n4.1 The Employer agrees to deduct union dues, the initiation fee  \nand authorized assessments from the weekly wages of employees in the  \nbargaining unit who provide the Employer with a voluntary written  \nauthorization to do so.

In the event no  \nwages are due an employee or are insufficient to cover the required  \ndeductions, the deductions for such week Shall be made from the wages next  \ndue the employee and thereupon transmitted to the Union.  \n4.2 Remittances of funds deducted from union members shall be  \naccompanied by an itemized statement showing the name of each employee and  \nthe amount checked off for dues, initiation fees, and assessments together  \nwith a list of Union employees from whom dues assessments and initiation  \nfees have not been collected. In addition to the above, the Employer shall  \nfurnish to the Union, each month, a list of those employees who have  \nterminated and the date they terminated.  \n4.3 The Employer shall provide a payroll deduction for voluntary  \nActive Ballot Club contributions. Such deductions shall be made and  \nremitted in accordance with Section 4.1 of this Article.  \n4.4 The Employer agrees to deduct from an employee's earnings each  \npayroll period, including vacation pay, the amount specified by an employee  \non the UFCW Local 23 Federal Credit Union written authorization for payroll  \ndeductions. Payroll deductions will commence with the payroll period  \nfollowing receipt of an employee's written authorization for UFCW Local 23  \nFederal Credit Union payroll deductions.

However, these meetings do not  \nreplace the need for communications or meetings between the Union's Business  \nRepresentatives and the Employer's representative to resolve problems on a  \nday-to-day basis as they occur. It is the intent of both parties to resolve  \ncurrent issues without delay.  \nARTICLE 7 - No Strike/No Lockout:  \n7.1 The contracting parties agree that, as a part of the  \nconsideration of this Agreement, any and all disputes, claims or demands  \ngrowing or arising from any Article or Section of this Agreement shall be  \nsettled by the contracting parties and determined exclusively by the  \nmachinery provided in the \"Settlement of Disputes\" Section of this  \nAgreement, or by the full use of free collective bargaining.  \n7.2 It is mutually agreed that there shall be no strikes or  \njockouts during the existence of this Agreement.
