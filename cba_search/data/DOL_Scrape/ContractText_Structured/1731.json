This Section does not affect other remedies, whether  \nprovided by law or this Agreement that may be available to the Union and/or Joint Trust Funds.  \nNo piece work will be required or permitted by employees covered by this Agreement.  \nIn any action instituted to recover fringe benefit contributions, wages, union dues or Industry  \nFund contributions, or to recover unpaid liquidated damages, the Employer shall be obligated to  \npay reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and reasonable accounting fees in addition to all principal amounts  \ndue and in addition to other relief prescribed by law.  \nSECTION 5  \nUnion Recognition  \nThe Union is recognized as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for all journeymen painters,  \ntapers and drywall finishers, paper and wall covering hangers, apprentices, pre-apprentices,  \nsummer help and working foremen employed by the Employer.  \nThe Employers agree to employ at least one non-contracting journeyman painter on all work.  \nSECTION 6  \nUnion Security  \nIt is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that as a condition of continued  \nemployment all persons who are hereafter employed by the Employer in the unit which is subject  \nto this Agreement shall become members of the Union on the eighth day after their employment  \nor the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; that the continued employment by  \nthe Employer in said unit of persons who are already members in good standing of the Union  \nshall be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the periodic dues of the  \nUnion; and that the continued employment of persons who were in the employ of the Employer  \nprior to the date of this Agreement and who are not now members of the Union, shall be  \nconditioned upon those persons becoming members of the Union on the eighth day following the  \nexecution of this Agreement. The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such  \nrequired times shall obligate the employer, upon written notice from the Union to such effect and  \nto the further effect that Union membership was available to such person on the same terms and  \nconditions generally available to other members, forthwith to discharge such person.  \nFurthermore, the failure of any person to maintain his union membership in good standing as  \nrequired herein, upon written notice to the Employer by the Union to such effect, shall obligate  \nthe Employer to discharge such person.  \nSECTION 7  \nEmployment  \nThe parties recognize the fact to be that the Union\u2019s knowledge and experience with the industry  \ninvolved herein, together with the sources of competent manpower available to it, can be of  \nassistance to the Employer in recruiting needed employees. It is therefore agreed that, whenever  \nemployees are to be hired, the Employer shall include the Union among other persons, firms, or  \ncorporations to be notified and shall afford the Union an opportunity to recommend job  \napplicants. The Employer further agrees to give such member due consideration, consistent with  \nthe provisions of the National Labor Relations act, as amended.  \nThe aforesaid notification of needed employees shall specify the name and location of the job in  \nquestion, the. probable duration of the job, the class or classes of employees to be hired, the  \nnumber of employees required in each class, the probable length of employment of those in each  \nclass and the experience and qualifications desired of same employees.  \nThe Employer shall notify the Union whenever employees are hired, giving their names and  \naddresses, date of employment and the job classifications to which they are assigned. The  \nEmployer shall notify the Union in writing whenever an employee performing work covered by  \nthis Agreement 1s to be transferred to a position in which he will be performing no work covered  \nby this Agreement.  \nWhen qualified members are not available, the Employer agrees to notify the Union in advance of  \nthe desire to employ additional help.

The Board will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the  \nuse and disclosure of protected health information received from the Welfare  \nPlan available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the purposes  \nof determining compliance by the Welfare Plan with the HIPAA Privacy Rule;  \n7. If feasible, the Board will return or destroy all protected health information  \nreceived from the Welfare Plan that the Board still maintains in any form and  \nwill retain no copies of such information when it is no longer needed for the  \npurpose for which the disclosure was originally made;  \n8. Access to protected health information maintained by the Board of Trustees or  \nthe Welfare Plan will be limited to those employees with the responsibility of  \ncarrying out the plan administration functions of the Welfare Plan and the  \nTrust. Such access will be limited to that which is necessary to carry out the  \nplan administration functions and Trust functions;  \n9. Employees who violate these provisions by using protected health information  \nbeyond that which is necessary to carry out their plan administration and Trust  \nfunctions will be sanctioned under the Welfare Plan\u2019s adopted policy for  \nsanctioning employees that violate the Welfare Plan\u2019s health information privacy  \npolicies and procedures.  \n   \n   \nby) / Lp FY OF  \nATE  \n9/11/23  \n   \n   \n    \nRICHARD BRYAN  \n   \nDANIEL LEACH _ DATE  \n|  \nKEVIN KENNY DATE DONALD THOMAS DATE  \n   \n   \nPAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 2  \n"], ["", "ARTICLE I  \nARTICLE I  \nARTICLE Il  \nARTICLE IV  \nARTICLE V  \nARTICLE VI  \nARTICLE Vil  \nARTICLE VII  \nARTICLE IX  \nARTICLE X  \nARTICLE XI  \nARTICLE XI  \nARTICLE XIII  \nARTICLE XIV  \nARTICLE XV  \nARTICLE XVI  \nARTICLE XVII  \nARTICLE XVII  \nARTICLE XIX  \nPENSION TRUST  \nAND  \nPLAN AGREEMENT  \n(Restated Effective July 1, 1994)  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n2  \nDefinitions ........... 2  \nName and Objectives 5  \nPartiCi PatiOn 5  \nEmployer Participation 6  \nAccrual Of Benefits 6  \nConditions for Benefit Entitlement/Types of 10  \nVesting Requirements 15  \nForms of Benefit Payments 16  \nApplication for and Timing of Benefit Distribution 19  \nBenefit Claims Procedure 20  \nLimitations Of Benefits 21  \nMiscellaneous Provisions 23  \nacess eens sera wap rsa seas 29  \nTermination 30  \nMerger or Consolidation 31  \n31  \nTrustees\u2019 Powers and Duties a2  \nGovernmental Approval 33  \nVE DANG ws 34  \n  \nTHIS AGREEMENT, first made and entered into as of the first day of July, 1964, by and between ST.

This Article sets forth the mules for determining and computing the amount of a  \nParticipant\u2019s accrued benefit under the Plan. The accumulation and retention of accrued benefit credits are subject  \nto the requirements concerning Years of Vesting Service. The Benefit Amounts are subject to reduction on account  \nof the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VII) and modification if the Participant retires with an annuity  \nstarting date other than his normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the normal form of benefits.  \nEligibility depends on meeting the conditions for benefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning  \nYears of Vesting service and permanent break in service.  \n5.2 Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of this Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a  \n60 month guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting  \nDate and continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his  \nAnnuity Starting Date, but before all sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining  \npayments shall be made to the named beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such beneficiary is not then surviving, to the  \ncontingent beneficiary, if then surviving. If no designated beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participant's death,  \nthe remaining payments shall be made to the Participant\u2019s estate. If a beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed  \npayments dies before all guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the conungent beneficiary, if one  \nis then surviving. If no contingent beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate  \nof the beneficiary who last received a payment, all guaranteed payments have been made.  \nThe amount of benefit stated in the Plan (Section 5.3) is the amount which the Participant would receive each  \nmonth, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, commencing at normal retirement date.  \nIn the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, or  \nin the event the Participant begins to receive benefits at a time other than his normal retirement date, the monthly  \namount which the Participant will be entitled to receive will be different from the amount stated in this section. The  \namount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the  \n\u20146\u2014  \nactuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month  \nguarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.  \n. The amount of benefit that a Participant accrues  \nstated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement  \nDate, is the sum of the amount determined under subsection 5.3A and the amount determined under Section 5.3B.  \nA. The amount determined under this subsection (\u201caccredited past service benefit\u201d) is $2.50 for each year of  \naccredited past service for any Participant who participated on and after July 1, 1964, but who commenced  \nparticipation prior to July 1, 1965. An eligible Participant receives a year of accredited past service for  \neach continuous year of service prior to July 1, 1965. No Participant who first participated in the Plan after  \nJuly 1, 1965 shall be entitled to past service credits. The amount determined under this subsection is subject  \nto the rules conceming permanent breaks in service.  \nB. The amount determined under this subsection (\u201caccredited future service benefit\u201d) is the sum of the  \namounts earned by the Participant under all applicable tables. Accredited future service benefit will be  \naccrued under this subsection for each 12 consecutive month period commencing with July 1, 1964, and  \nsubsequent anniversaries thereof (\u201cbenefit accrual year\u201d), based on the number of \u201chours of service\u201d  \ncompleted by the Participant during the particular benefit accrual year, subject to the following rules:  \n1.

Definition. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse  \nof a Participant who meets the requirement of Section 6.6A, computed under Section 6.6C.  \n1. Ifa Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant,  \nthe amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the  \namount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant  \nhad retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the Participant\u2019s Death.  \n\u201413\u2014  \n2.  \nIf a Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant,  \nthe amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the  \namount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity, if the Participant  \nhad:  \na. Separated from service on the day he last worked in covered employment;  \nb. Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant.  \nc. Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and  \nd. Died on the next day.  \nSubject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse shall  \ncommence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:  \na. The date of the Participant\u2019s death, or  \nb. The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;  \nand shall continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse dies.  \nNo survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant\u2019s spouse fails to survive to the date on  \nwhich the annuity payments are to begin.

The Participant\u2019s Normal Retirement Date; or  \nb. The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant\u2019s 62nd birthday.  \nIn the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the  \namount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor  \nannuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before the  \ndeferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant\u2019s spouse elects to defer the  \nAnnuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting Date, no  \nsurvivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section  \n6.7.  \nThe Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to the  \nannuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed $3,500.  \nFor purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan 1s  \nrequired to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  \nCorporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.  \n6.7 Beneficiary Annuity.  \nA.

No benefits are accrued for contiguous noncovered service.  \n. Aone year break in service occurs when, during any vesting computation period up to and including the  \nvesting computation period that ended on June 30, 1992, a Participant has no hours of service. For vesting  \ncomputation period beginning with the vesting computation period that begins on July 1, 1992 and  \nthereafter, a one year break in service occurs when, during any such vesting computation period, a  \nParticipant or former Participant completes less than 400 hours of service.  \n. A Participant who experiences a one year break in service after he has become vested within the meaning  \nof 7.1, is entitled to have his pre-break service counted for vesting and benefit accrual purposes.  \n.

For purposes of adjusting any benefit under this subsection, the interest rate  \nassumption shall be 5%.  \nE. Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection A of this section, if a Participant was covered by the Plan  \nbefore the first day of the Limitation Year beginning in 1983, he may receive an annual retirement benefit  \nwhich is not less than the amount of his current accrued benefit as of the close of the last Limitation Year  \nbeginning before 1983, as determined under the terms of the Plan as then in effect disregarding any  \namendments or cost of living adjustments after July 1, 1982.

Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.  \nEffective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:  \n1.  \nThis Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Credit Year commencing after December 31, 1983,  \nin which, as of the Determination Date,  \na. the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees and  \nb. the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an  \nAggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and the  \naggregate accounts of all Key Employees and non-Key Employees under this Plan and all plans  \nof an Aggregation Group.  \nIf any participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key  \nEmployee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits  \nand/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining  \nwhether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this  \nPlan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31,  \n1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer  \nmaintaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date,  \nthe aggregate account and/or present value of accrued benefit for such Participant or former  \nParticipant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is  \na Top-Heavy Plan.  \nA Participant\u2019s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under applicable  \nprovisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.  \n\u201cAggregation Group\u201d means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation  \nGroup as hereinafter determined.  \na. In determining a Required Aggregation Group hereunder, each plan of an Employer.in which a  \nKey Employee is a Participant, and each other plan of an Employer which enables any plan in  \nwhich a Key Employee participates to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of  \nthe Internal Revenue Code, will be required to be aggregated. Such group shall be known as a  \n\u201cRequired Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a Top-  \nHeavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Required  \nAggregation Group 1s a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy  \nPlan.  \nb. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required  \nAggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the  \nprovisions of Section 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such group shall be  \nknown as a \u201cPermissive Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required  \nAggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group  \nis a Top-Heavy Plan. No pian in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-  \nHeavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.  \n\u2014 26 \u2014  \nc. Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan  \nCredit Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.  \n4. In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits shall be  \ndetermined:  \na. as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within a  \ntwelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;  \nb. forthe first Plan Credit Year, as if:  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account the  \nestimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.  \nc. forany other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation  \ndate,  \nd. the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit plan  \nminimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan Credit Year.  \n5. The calculation of a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date shall  \nbe the sum of the following:  \na. the present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent  \nactuarial valuation;  \nb. any Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date or  \nwithin four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after the  \nvaluation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  \ndistributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already included  \nin the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions made  \npriorto July 1, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated  \nwould have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;  \nc. any Employee contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts attnbutable  \nto tax deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be considered to be a  \npart of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits;  \nd. with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the  \nEmployee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another  \nEmployer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall always consider  \nsuch rollover or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan  \nis the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers  \nor plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant's present value  \nof accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted prior to July 1, 1984,  \nshall be considered as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits; and  \ne. with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the  \nEmployee or made to a plan maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover  \nor plan-to-plan transfer, it shal] not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this section. If  \nthis Plan is the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover  \nor plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits, irrespective  \nof the date on which such rollover os transfer is accepted.  \n\u201cTop-Heavy Group\u201d means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date, the  \nsum of:  \n(1) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans  \nincluded in the group; and  \n(2) the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included in  \nthe group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all Participants.  \n. . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for herein  \nfor the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan Credit Years  \nbeginning after December 31, 1983) shall be extended in accordance with any federal law or  \nregulatory authority.  \nC. Top-Heavy Vesting.  \n1.  \nNotwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan for any  \nTop-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s accrued benefit shall be  \ndetermined on the basis of the Participant\u2019s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the  \nfollowing schedule:  \nService for Vesting  \n(excluding Years of Service for Vesting  \nprior to effective date of this Pian) Vested percentage  \n1 year 0%  \n2 years 0%  \n3 years 100%  \nIf, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may elect  \ncontinue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s  \naccrued benefit; or  \nrevert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to  \nSection 41 1(a)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued  \nbenefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and any  \nParticipant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of remaining  \nunder the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a Plan amendment.  \nThe Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Employee who does not  \nhave one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee\u2019s  \naccrued benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this  \nArticle.  \nD. Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.  \nThe minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this section  \nfor each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shal] equal the product of:  \none-twelfth (1/12th) of Annual Compensation averaged over the five consecutive \u201climitation  \nyears\u201d (or actual number of \u201climitation years\u201d if less) which produces the highest average, and  \nthe lesser of  \n\u2014 28 \u2014  \n   \n0?  \n(1) two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or  \n(2) twenty percent (20%).  \nFor purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code, a  \nNon-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:  \na. his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or  \nb. he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan will be considered to be a Participant.  \nFor purposes of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to J uly  \n1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  \ndisregarded.  \nFor purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any \u201climitation year\u201d ending prior to July 1,  \n1984, or subsequent to the last \u201climitation year\u201d during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  \ndisregarded. The term \u201climitation year\u201d means the Plan Credit Year.  \nIf the Plan provides for the normal retirement benefit to be paid in a form other than a single life  \nannuity, the accrued benefit under this section shall be the Actuarial Equivalence of the minimum  \naccrued benefit under Artucle V. |  \nIf payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement Age,  \nthe minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.  \nIf aNon-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included in a Required  \nAggregation Group which is Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under this Plan.  \nTo the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VII of the Plan the minimum accrued benefit  \nunder this section may not be forfeited under Sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D) of the Internal  \nRevenue Code.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XI  \nRight to Amend  \n", "The Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Pian and Trust without the consent of any Participant, at any  \ntime from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no this Trust shall depnve  \nany Participant of any accrued benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment be contrary  \nto any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concering this Trust, provided that  \nthe Trustees may adopt an amendment  \nA.  \nIf it is necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plan or the Trust Fund under the Internal  \nRevenue Code and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or  \nIf the amendment meets the requirements of Section 302(c)(8) of ERISA and Section 412(c)(8) of the  \nInternal Revenue Code, and the Secretary of Labor has been notified of such amendment and has either  \napproved of it or, within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, has failed to disapprove.  \nEither the Trustees representing the Union or the Trustees representing the Employers may propose amendments  \nto this Trust.

The Benefit Amounts are subject to  \nreduction on account of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VIII) and modification if the Participant  \nretires with an annuity starting date other than his normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the  \nnormal form of benefits.  \nEligibility to receive a benefit based on the Participant\u2019s accrued benefit depends on meeting the conditions for  \nbenefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning Years of Vesting Service and Permanent Break in  \nService (Article VII).  \n5.2 Normal Form of Benefit, For purposes of this Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a 60  \nmonth guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting Date  \nand continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his Annuity  \nStarting Date, but before all sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining payments shall  \nbe made to the named beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such beneficiary is not then surviving, to the contingent  \nbeneficiarey, if then surviving. If no designated beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participant\u2019s death, the  \nremaining payments shall be made to the Participant\u2019s estate. If a beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed payments  \ndies before al! guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the contingent beneficiary, if one is then  \nsurviving. If no contingent beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate of the  \nbeneficiary who last received a payment, until all guaranteed payments have been made.  \n_ The amount of benefit stated in the Plan (Section 5.3) is the amount which the Participant would receive each  \nmonth, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, commencing at normal retirement date.  \nIn the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, or  \nin the event the Participant begins to receive benefits at a time other than his normal retirement date, the monthly  \namount which the Participant will be entitled to receive will be different from the amount stated in this section. The  \namount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the  \nactuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month  \nguarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.  \n5.3 Amount of Benefit Stated in the Normal Benefit Form, The amount of benefit that a Participant accrues  \nstated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement  \nDate, is the sum of the amount determined under subsection 5.3A and the amount determined under Section 5.3B.  \nA.

At that time the Participant shall receive the notices and elections that a Participant  \nwould receive at Normal Retirement Age. The Participant\u2019s monthly benefit after converting to Early  \nor Normal Retirement Benefit will in no event be less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month.  \nC. Nothing in this Section shall affect the nght of a Participant who is otherwise eligible for any benefit  \nunder this Plan. Nor shall the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of  \nretirement or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his beneficiary under other  \nprovisions of this Plan. A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the  \nsame retirement benefits (Preretirement Survivor Annuity, Early Retirement Benefit and Normal  \nRetirement Benefit) in the same form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and  \nelection procedures as he would otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability  \nbenefits.  \n\u201412\u2014  \n6.5 Death Benefit, Effective March 1, 1986, in addition to the benefits otherwise provided by this Plan and  \nTrust, the Plan and Trust shall pay a death benefit in the amount of $3,000 to the designated beneficiary of any  \nParticipant who has retired under this Plan on July 1, 1982 or thereafter, provided the Participant was an active  \nParticipant at the time of his Annuity Starting Date. For purposes of this paragraph, the term retirement means that  \nthe Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Total and Permanent Disability  \nPayment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not  \nceased under Article II. |  \nEffective with respect to Participants who die September 1, 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the re-  \nquirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall  \nnot apply to any Participant who was employed by an employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and  \nPictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an hour of  \nservice.  \nEffective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the re-  \nquirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for Death Benefit only if the Partici-  \npant was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan) a covered Participant for the Death  \nBenefit under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or on Waiver of Premium for Disability under the  \nPainters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust. For  \npurposes of the death benefit for deaths that occur on or after October 1, 1991, it is no longer required that the  \nParticipant shall have been an active Participant in the Painters District Council Pension Plan at the time cf his  \nAnnuity Starting Date.  \n6.6 Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.  \nA. General Rule, A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to  \nthe surviving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22, 1984 but before his Annuity Starting  \nDate, who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the  \ndate of death, and who has met one of the requirements of Article VII and was therefore vested as of  \nthe date of his death.  \nB. Definition, A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse  \nof a Participant who meets the requirements of Section 6.6A computed under Section 6.6C.  \nC. Compoutation of Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity,  \n1. If a Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that  \nParticipant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving  \nspouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a Survivor annuity  \nif the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the  \nParticipant\u2019s death. If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date  \nunder subsection 6.6C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that  \nsubsection.  \n2. Ifa Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Partici-  \npant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving  \n- spouse is the amount which would be payable to the surviving spouse as a suvivor annuity, if the  \nParticipant had:  \na. Separated from service on the day he last worked in covered employment;  \nb. Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;  \nc. Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and  \nd. Died on the next day.  \nIf, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under subsection 6.6C.4,  \nthe amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.  \n3. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse  \nshall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:  \na. The date of the Participant\u2019s death, or  \nb. The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;  \nand shal] continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse  \ndies. No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant\u2019s spouse fails to survive to the  \ndate on which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable  \nunder Section 6.7.  \n4. Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to  \nany date on or before the later of:  \na. The Participant\u2019s Normal Retirement Date; or  \nb. The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant\u2019s 62nd birthday.  \nIn the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the  \namount wil] be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor  \nannuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before  \nthe deferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant\u2019s spouse elects to defer  \nthe Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting  \nDate, no survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable  \nunder Section 6.7.  \n5. The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to  \nthe annuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed  \n$5,000.  \nFor purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan  \nis required to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  \nCorporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.  \n6.7 Beneficiary Annuity,  \nA. ABeneficiary Annuity, as defined in subsection 6.7B shall be paid to the beneficiary determined under  \nB.  \nsubsection 6.7C of any Participant who meets either of the following eligibility requirements:  \n]. A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starung Date but has not met the requirements  \nfor a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity; or  \n2. A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified  \nPreretirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse\u2019s  \nAnnuity Starting Date under the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.  \nThe Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable under the Normal  \nForm of Benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at the Participant\u2019s Normal  \nRetirement Date, provided, however, that this amount 1s payable to the beneficiary or beneficianes  \ndetermined under Section 6.7C only for 60 months. Benefit payments to the benficiary will  \ncommence with the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participant would  \nhave reached age 60 or if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant  \ndies or if later, the first day of the month following the death of the surviving spouse.  \nThe beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same  \nmanner as the beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2, except that if payment is required to be  \nmade under that section to the Participant\u2019s estate and if more than one year has passed since the  \nparticipant\u2019s death, the payments shall be made to the Participant\u2019s legal heirs determined under the  \nlaws of intestacy of the State of Missouri as of the date the payments are to commence.  \nThis Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or before  \nJanuary 19, 1995.  \n\u201414\u2014  \n"], ["ARTICLE VI  \n", "Vestin j nt  \n7.1 General Rule.

For Plan Credit Years beginning on or after July 1, 1994, the amount of a Participant\u2019s  \nCompensation (as defined in subsection 11.1 B above) from any single employer that may be  \ntaken into account for any Plan purpose in any Plan Credit Year is $150,000, as that amount  \nmay be adjusted from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 401(a)(17)  \nof the Internal Revenue Code.  \nb. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, effective July 1, 1994, the accrued benefit  \nof any Participant whose Compensation exceeded $150,000 in any Plan Credit Year  \nbeginning before August 1, 1994, shall be the greater of:  \nthe sum of  \n(1) The Participant\u2019s accrued benefit as of June 30, 1994, determined under Article V as  \nthough the Participant had terminated employment on that date and without regard to  \nany Plan amendments adopted after that date (but taking into account remedial amend-  \nments that apply retroactively before that date under Section 401(b) of the Internal  \nRevenue Code), plus  \n(2) the amount of the Participant\u2019s benefit accrued on or after July 1, 1994, under Article V,  \ntaking into account only years of service after June 30, 1994, and  \nthe Participant\u2019s accrued benefit, determined under Article V, taking into account all Years of  \nService before and after July 1, 1994.  \nsatan  \n\u201cDetermination Date\u201d means, with respect to any Plan Credit Year, the last day of the preceding  \nPlan Credit Year, or in the case of the first Plan Credit Year of any Plan, the last day of such Plan  \nCredit Year.  \n\u2014 24 \u2014  \nZs  \n~  \n-  \nB. Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.  \nEffective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:  \n1.  \nThis Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Credit Year commencing after December 31, 1983,  \nin which, as of the Determination Date,  \na. the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees and  \nb. the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an  \nAggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and  \nthe aggregate accounts of all Key Employees and Non-Key Employees under this Plan and  \nall plans of an Aggregation Group. .  \nIf any Participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key  \nEmployee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits  \nand/or aggregate account balance shal! not be taken into account for purposes of determining  \nwhether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this  \nPlan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31],  \n1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer main-  \ntaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date, the  \naggregate account and/or present value of accrued benefit for such Participant or former Partici-  \npant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-  \nHeavy Plan.  \nA Participant\u2019s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under  \napplicable provisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan  \nstatus.  \n\u2018Aggregation Group\u201d means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation  \nGroup as hereinafter determined.  \na. In determining a Required Aggregration Group hereunder, each plan of an Employer in which  \na Key Employee is a Participant, and each other plan of an Employer which enables any plan  \nin which a Key Employee participates to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and  \n410 of the Internal Revenue Code, will be required to be aggregated. Such group shall be  \nknown as a \u201cRequired Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a  \nTop-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the  \nRequired Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group  \nis not a Top-Heavy Plan.  \nb. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required  \nAggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to  \nsatisfy the provisions of Section 401](a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such  \ngroup shall be known as a \u201cPermissive Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required  \nAggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group  \nis a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a  \nTop-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.  \nc. Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan  \nCredit Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy  \nPlans.  \nIn the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits shall be  \ndetermined:  \na. as ofthe most recent actuarial valuation date which ts the most recent valuation date within  \na twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;  \nb. for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:  \nCc.  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account  \nthe estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.  \nfor any other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial  \nvaluation date,  \nthe valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit  \nplan minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan  \nCredit Year.  \n5. The calculation of a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date  \nshall be the sum of the following:  \na.  \nthe present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent  \nactuarial valuation;  \nany Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date  \nor within four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after  \nthe valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  \ndistributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already  \nincluded in the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions  \nmade prior to July 1, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been  \nterminated would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;  \nany Employer contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts  \nattributable to tax deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be  \nconsidered to be a part of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits;  \nwith respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by  \nthe Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by  \nanother Employer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall  \nalways consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this  \nsection. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not  \nconsider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the  \nParticipant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-pjan transfers  \naccepted prior to July 1, 1984, shall be considered as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of  \naccrued benefits; and  \nwith respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the  \nEmployee or made to a plan maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the  \nrollover or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this  \nsection. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall  \nconsider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of  \n\u2018accrued benefits, irrespective of the date on which such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer is  \naccepted.  \n\u201cTop-Heavy Group\u201d means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date,  \nthe sum of:  \n(1) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans  \nincluded in the group; and  \n(2) the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included  \nin the group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all  \nParticipants.  \n\u20142%\u2014~  \n\u2014  \ng. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for  \nherein for the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan  \nCredit Years beginning after December 31, 1983) shall be extended in accordance with any  \nfederal law or regulatory authority.  \nC. Top-Heavy Vesting.  \n1.  \n2.  \nNotwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan, for  \nany Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s accrued benefit shall be  \ndetermined on the basis of the Participant\u2019s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the  \nfollowing schedule:  \nService for Vesting  \n(excluding Years of  \nService for Vesting  \nprior to effective Vested  \ndate of this Plan) percentage  \n] Year 0%  \n2 years 0%  \n3 years 100%  \nIf, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may  \nelect to:  \na. continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s  \naccrued benefit; or  \nb. revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to  \nSection 411(a)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the  \naccrued benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and  \nany Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of  \nremaining under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a  \nPlan amendment.  \nThe Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Employee who does  \nnot have one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee's  \naccrued benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this  \nArticle. . .  \nD. Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.  \nl.  \nThe minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this  \nsection for each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product of:  \na. one-twelfth (1/12th) of Annual Compensation averaged over the five consecutive \u201climitation  \nyears\u201d (or actual number of \u201climitation years\u201d if less) which produces the highest average,  \nand  \nb. the lesser of  \n(1) two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or  \n(2) twenty percent (20%).  \nFor purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code,  \na Non-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:  \na. his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or  \nb. he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan  \nwill be considered to be a Participant.  \n\u201427\u2014  \n3. For purpose of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July  \n1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  \ndisregarded.  \n4. For purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any \u201climitation year\u201d ending prior to July  \n1, 1984, or subsequent to the last \u201climitation year\u201d during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan  \nShall be disregarded. The term \u201climitation year\u201d means the.Plan Credit Year.  \n5. If the Plan provides for the normal retirement to be paid in a form other than a single life annuity,  \nthe accrued benefit under this section shal! be the Actuarial Equivalence of the minimum accrued  \nbenefit under Article V.  \n6. If payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement  \nAge, the minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.  \n7. If a Non-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included in a  \nRequired Aggregation Group which is Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under  \nthis Plan.  \n8. To the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VII of the Plan, the minimum accrued  \nbenefit under this section may not be forfeited under Section 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D) of the  \nInternal Revenue Code.  \n"], ["ARTICLE Xi  \nRight to Amend  \n", "The Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Plan and Trust without the consent of any Participant, at any  \ntime from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no amendment to this Trust shall  \ndeprive any Participant of any accrued benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment  \nbe contrary to any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust,  \nprovided that the Trustees may adopt an amendment.  \nA. If it is necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plam or the Trust Fund under the  \nInternal Revenue Code and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or  \nB. If the amendment meets the requirements of Section 302(c)(8) of ERISA and Section 412(c)(8) of  \nthe Internal Revenue Code, and the Secretary of Labor has been notified of such amendment and has  \neither approved of it or, within 90 days after the date on which notice was filed, has failed to  \ndisapprove.  \nEither the Trustees representing the Union or the Trustees representing the Employers may propose amendments  \nto this Trust. Such amendment will become effective when it has been approved and executed by a majority of the  \nTrustees.

Rul.  \n2002-62.  \nEffective July |, 2002, change Section 11.1 to read as follows:  \nLimitation on Benefits  \nLimitation. The annual benefit otherwise payable to a Participant at any time will  \nnot exceed the maximum permissible benefit. If the benefit the Participant would  \notherwise accrue for a Plan Year would produce an annual benefit in excess of the  \nmaximum permissible benefit, the rate of accrual will be credited so the annual  \nbenefit will equal the maximum permissible benefit.  \nDefined benefit dollar limitation. The \u201cdefined benefit dollar limitation\u201d is  \n$160,000, as adjusted, effective January | of each year, under Code \u00a7 415(d) in  \nsuch manner as the Secretary shall prescribe and payable in the form of a straight  \nlife annuity. A limitation as adjusted under Code \u00a7 415(d) will apply to limitation  \nyears ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.  \nMaximum permissible benefit. The \u201cmaximum permissible benefit\u201d 1s the  \ndefined benefit dollar limitation (as adjusted where required, as provided in (1),  \n(11) and (111) below).  \n(1) If the Participant has fewer than ten years of participation in the Plan, the  \ndefined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (1) the  \nnumerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of  \nparticipation in the Plan and (2) the denominator of which is ten. In the  \ncase of a Participant who has fewer than ten years of participation in the  \nPlan, the defined benefit compensation limitation shall be multiplied by a  \nfraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part  \nthereof) of participation in the Plan, and (2) the denominator of which is  \nten.  \n(11) If the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age sixty-two, the defined  \nbenefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at such earlier age is  \nan annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning  \n(iii)  \n(iv)  \nat the earlier age that is the Actuarial Equivalent of the defined benefit  \ndollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age sixty-two (adjusted  \nunder (i) above, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation  \napplicable at an age prior to age sixty-two 1s determined as of the lesser of  \n(1) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar  \nlimitation computed using the interest rate specified in Section 1.4.A and  \nmortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Section 1.4.C.4 and (2)  \nthe Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar  \nlimitation computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable  \nmortality table as defined in Section |1.4.C.4. Any decrease in the defined  \nbenefit dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph (11)  \nshall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the  \ndeath of the Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full  \nmortality decrement is taken into account.  \nIf the benefit of a Participant begins after the Participant attains age sixty-  \nfive, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at  \nthe later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life  \nannuity beginning at the later age that is Actuarially Equivalent to the  \ndefined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age sixty-  \nfive (adjusted under (1) above, if required). The Actuarial Equivalent of  \nthe defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age after age sixty-  \nfive is determined as (1) the lesser of the Actuarial Equivalent (at such  \nage) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest  \nrate specified in Section 1.4.A and mortality table (or other tabular factor)  \nspecified in Section 1.4.C.4 and (2) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age)  \nof the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a five percent  \ninterest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in  \nSection 1.4.C.4. For these purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age  \nat which benefits commence shall be ignored.  \nExcept as provided herein, where a benefit is payable in a form other than  \na straight life annuity, the benefit must be adjusted to an Actuarially  \nEquivalent straight life annuity before applying the limitations of this  \nSection. Where a Participant\u2019s benefit must be adjusted to an Actuarially  \nEquivalent straight life annuity, the Actuarially Equivalent straight life  \nannuity is equal to the greater of (1) the annuity benefit computed using  \nthe interest rate specified in Section 1.4.A and the mortality table (or other  \ntabular factor) specified in Section 1.4.C.4 and (2) the annuity benefit  \ncomputed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable  \nmortality table defined in Section 1.4.C.4. In determining the actuarial  \nequivalent of a single sum payment, the interest rate specified in Section  \n1.4.C.1 and the applicable mortality table specified in Section 1.4.C.4 shall  \nbe used. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit is required for (1) the  \nvalue of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity under Section 8.1.B, (2)  \nbenefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a  \nqualified disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits and_post-  \nretirement medical benefits), and (3) the value of post-retirement cost-of-  \n- 5 _  \n(d)  \n6.  \nfollows:  \nliving increases made in accordance with Code \u00a7 415(d) and Section  \n1.415-3(c)(2)ai1) of the Treasury Tax Regulations. The benefits do not  \ninclude any benefits attributable to Employee contributions or rollover  \ncontributions, or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not  \nmaintained by an Employer.  \nIn the case of an individual who was a participant in one or more defined benefit  \nplans of the Employer on July 1, 1982, the application of the limitations of this  \nSection 4.04 shall not cause the maximum permissible amount for such individual  \nunder all such defined benefit plans to be less than the individual\u2019s accrued  \nbenefit under all such defined benefit plans as of the last day of the limitation year  \nbeginning before January |, 1983. The preceding sentence applies only if all such  \ndefined benefit plans met the requirements of Section 415 of the Code, as in effect  \non July 1, 1982, for all limitation years beginning before January 1, 1983.  \nEffective July 1, 2002, change Subsection 12.8.A.1 to read as follows:  \nKey Employee. Any Employee or former Employee (including any deceased  \nEmployee) who at the determination date was:  \n(1) An officer of an Employer whose Compensation is greater than $130,000  \n(as adjusted under Code \u00a7 416(1)(1) for Plan Years beginning after March  \n31, 2003).  \n(11) ~\u2014 A five percent (5%) owner of an Employer, or  \n(ii) A one percent (1%) owner of an Employer having annual Compensation  \nfrom the Employer of more than $150,000.  \nFor purposes of this Subsection \u201cCompensation\u201d means compensation within the  \nmeaning of Code Section 415(c)(3). The determination of who is a Key  \nEmployee shall be determined tn accordance with Code Section 416(1)(1) and the  \napplicable Treasury regulations and other guidelines of general applicability  \nissued hereunder.  \nEffective July 1, 2002, change Section 12.8.A.3.a to read as follows:  \na. The amount of a Participant\u2019s compensation (as defined in Subsection  \n12.1.B above) from any single Employer that may be taken into account  \nfor any Plan purpose in any Plan Year is $200,000, as that amount may be  \nadjusted from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code  \n\u00a7 401(a)(17).  \nEffective July 1, 2002, change the last sentence of Section 12.8.B.1 to read as  \nIn addition, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for  \nany Employer maintaining the Plan during the one year period ending on the  \nDetermination Date, the aggregate account and/or present value of Accrued  \n7.  \nBenefits for such Participant or former Participant shall not be taken into account  \nfor purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.  \nEffective July 1, 2002, delete Section 12.8.B.5.b and remember Sections  \n12.8.B.5.c, d, e, f and g as Sections 12.8.B.5.b, c, d, e and f, respectively.  \n8.  \nEffective July 1, 2002, change Section 12.8.B.5.c to read as follows:  \nc. with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which  \nare both initiated by the Employee and made from a plan maintained by  \none Employer to a plan maintained by another Employer), if this Plan  \nprovides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall always consider  \nsuch rollover or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this  \nSection.

Such cost of living  \nadjustment shall be limited to scheduled increases in accordance with Treasury  \nRegulations under Code \u00a7 415(d), and shall be effective no sooner than January |  \nof each year.  \nFor purposes of this Section \u201ccompensation\u201d shall mean the Employee\u2019s earned  \nincome, wages, salaries and fees for professional services, elective deferrals  \ndescribed in Code \u00a7 402(g)(3), amounts which are contributed or deferred by the  \nParticipant and, for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2000, which are not  \nincluded in gross income of a Participant under Code \u00a7 132(f)(4) and other  \namounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of  \nemployment with Employers maintaining the Plan (including, but not limited to,  \ncommissions paid to salesmen, percentage of profits, commissions on insurance  \npremiums, tips and bonuses), and excluding the following:  \nI.

Amounts realized from the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, or  \nwhen restricted stock (or property) held by an Employer either becomes  \nfreely transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  \n3. Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock  \nacquired under a qualified stock option plan.  \n46  \noe  \nIn the case of a Participant who has less than ten (10) years of Accredited Past and  \nFuture Service Benefits for purposes of benefit accrual, the limitations set forth in  \nSubsections 11.1.A and B shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  \nwhich is the number of the Participant\u2019s such years of Accredited Past and Future  \nService Benefits and the denominator of which is ten (10).  \nNotwithstanding the limitations of Subsection 11.1.A, if a Participant was covered  \nby the Plan before July |, 1987, he may receive an annual retirement benefit  \nwhich ts not less than the amount of his current Accrued Benefit as of the close of  \nthe last Plan Year ending July |, 1987, as determined under the terms of the Plan  \nas then in effect disregarding any amendments or cost of living adjustments after  \nJune 30, 1987.  \nEffective January 1, 1995, if the Participant\u2019s Accrued Benefit is paid in any form  \nother than a straight life annuity or a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the  \nbenefit must be adjusted to its Actuarial Equivalent in the form of a straight life  \nannuity for purposes of applying the limitations in Subsection 11.1.A. For  \npurposes of this adjustment, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to  \nretirement income benefits shall be disregarded. The Actuarially Equivalent  \nbenefit under this Subsection shall be calculated utilizing an interest rate  \nassumption which is the greater of (a) the rate specified in Subsection 1.4.A or (b)  \nfive (5) percent per year. However, in the case of any benefit paid in a single  \nsum, the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of the  \n\u201cApplicable Interest Rate,\u201d as defined in Subsection 1.4.C.1. The mortality  \nassumption utilized for purposes of calculating the actuarially equivalent benefit  \nunder this Subsection shall be determined using the table specified in Subsection  \n1.4.A.  \nIf payment of the Accrued Benefit of a Participant commences before the  \nParticipant\u2019s Social Security Retirement Age, but on or after age sixty-two (62),  \nthe dollar limitation specified in Subsection 11.1.A.1 shall be determined as  \nfollows:  \nl. If a Participant\u2019s Social Security Age is sixty-five (65) for benefits  \ncommencing on or after age sixty-two (62), the limitation 1s reduced by  \n5/9 of one percent for each month by which benefits commence before the  \nmonth in which the Participant attains age sixty-three (63).  \n2. If the Participant\u2019s Social Security Retirement Age is greater than sixty-  \nfive (65) for benefits commencing on or after age sixty-two (62), the  \nlimitation is reduced by 5/9 of one percent for each of the first thirty-six  \n(36) months and 5/12 of one percent for each of the additional months (up  \nto twenty-four (24) months) by which benefits commence before the  \nmonth of the Participant\u2019s Social Security Retirement Age.  \nIf the benefits of the Participant commence prior to age sixty-two (62), the  \ndefined benefit dollar limitation of Subsection 11.1.A.1 applicable to the  \nParticipant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight  \nlife annuity that is the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation for age sixty-two  \n47  \n(62), as determined above, reduced for each month by which benefits commence  \nbefore the month in which the Participant attains age sixty-two (62). Effective for  \nPlan Years beginning after June 30, 1995, the limitation applicable at age prior to  \nsixty-two (62) 1s determined (1) as the lesser of the Actuarial Equivalent of the  \nlimitation for age sixty-two (62) computed using the interest rate and mortality  \ntable specified in Subsection 1.4.A, or (11) the Actuarial Equivalent of the  \nlimitation for age sixty-two (62) computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate  \nand the applicable mortality table as defined in Subsection 1.4.A. Any decrease  \nin the limitation determined in accordance with this provision shall not reflect a  \nmortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the Participant.  \nIf any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into  \naccount.  \nIf payment of the Participant\u2019s Accrued Benefit commences after the Participant\u2019s  \nSocial Security Retirement Age, the limitation specified in Subsection 11.1.A.1  \napplicable to the Participant at the later age is the Annual Benefit payable in the  \nform of a straight life annuity commencing at the later age that is Actuarially  \nEquivalent to the limitation applicable to the Participant at the Participant\u2019s Social  \nSecurity Retirement Age. Effective for Plan Years beginning after June 30, 1995,  \nthe Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation at the Participant\u2019s Social Security  \nRetirement Age 1s determined as (1) the lesser of the Actuarial Equivalent of the  \nlimitation at the Participant\u2019s Social Security Retirement Age computed using the  \ninterest rate and mortality table specified in Subsection 1.4.A or (ii) the Actuarial  \nEquivalent of the limitation at the Participant\u2019s Social Security Retirement Age  \ncomputed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable  \nmortality table as defined in Subsection 1.4.A. For these purposes, mortality  \nbetween a Participant\u2019s Social Security Retirement Age and the age at which  \nbenefits commence must be ignored.  \nNotwithstanding anything else in this Section to the contrary, the benefit  \notherwise accrued or payable to a Participant under this Plan shall be deemed not  \nto exceed the limits of Subsection 11.1.A if:  \nl. The retirement benefits payable for a Plan year under any form of benefit  \nwith respect to such Participant under this Plan and under all other defined  \nbenefit plans (regardless of whether terminated) ever maintained by an  \nEmployer do not exceed $1,000 multiplied by the Participant\u2019s number of  \nYears of Vesting Service or parts thereof (not to exceed ten (10)) with the  \nEmployers, and  \n2.

In addition, for  \nPlan Years beginning after December 31, 1984, if a Participant or former  \nParticipant has not performed services for any Employer maintaining the  \nPlan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination  \nDate, the aggregate account and/or present value of Accrued Benefits for  \nsuch Participant or former Participant shall not be taken into account for  \nthe purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.  \nA Participant\u2019s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be  \ndetermined under applicable provisions of the defined contribution plan  \nused in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.  \n\u2018Aggregation Group\u201d means either a Required Aggregation Group or a  \nPermissive Aggregation Group as hereinafter determined.  \na.

No plan in the Required  \nAggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required  \nAggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Group.  \nb. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be  \nincluded in the Required Aggregation Group, provided the  \nresulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the  \nprovisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 401(a)(4) and 410. Such group shall be  \nknown as a \u201cPermissive Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is  \npart of the Required Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-  \n55  \nHeavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy  \nPlan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be  \nconsidered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group  \nis not a Top-Heavy Group.  \nOnly those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates  \nfall within the same Plan Year shall be aggregated in order to  \ndetermine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.  \nIn the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant\u2019s present value of  \naccrued benefits shall be determined:  \nas of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most  \nrecent valuation date within a twelve-month period ending on the  \nDetermination Date;  \nfor the first Plan Year, as if:  \n(1) the Participant terminated service as of the Determination  \nDate; or  \n(2) the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial  \nvaluation date, but taking into account the estimated  \npresent value of accrued benefits as of the Determination  \nDate.  \nfor any other Plan Year, as if the Participant terminated service as  \nof the actuarial valuation date.  \nthe actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for  \ncomputing the defined benefit plan minimum funding costs,  \nregardless of whether a valuation 1s performed tn the Plan Year.  \nThe calculation of a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of a  \nDetermination Date shall be the sum of the following:  \na.  \nthe present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions  \nstated in the most recent actuarial valuation;  \nany Plan distributions made within the Plan Year that includes the  \nDetermination Date or within four preceding Plan Years. However,  \nin the case of distributions made after the valuation date and prior  \nto the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  \ndistributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such  \ndistributions are already included in the Participant\u2019s present value  \nof accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions,  \nincluding distributions made prior to July 1, 1984, and  \ndistributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been  \n56  \nterminated would have been required to be included in an  \nAggregation Group, will be counted;  \nany Employee contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory.  \nHowever, amounts attributable to tax deductible, qualified  \nvoluntary employee contributions shall not be considered to be a  \npart of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits;  \nwith respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones  \nwhich are both initiated by the Employee and made from a plan  \nmaintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another -  \nEmployer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan  \ntransfers, it shall always consider such rollover or plan-to-plan  \ntransfers as a distribution for purposes of this Section. If this Plan  \nis the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it  \nshall not consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted  \nafter June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of  \naccrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers  \naccepted prior to July 1, 1984, shall be considered as part of the  \nParticipant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits; and  \nwith respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones  \neither not initiated by the Employee or made to a plan maintained  \nby the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover or plan-  \nto-plan transfer, it shall not be counted as a distribution for  \npurposes of this Section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such  \nrollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover or  \nplan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of  \naccrued benefits, irrespective of the date on which such rollover or  \nplan-to-plan transfer is accepted.  \n\u2018\u201c\u201cTop-Heavy Group\u201d means an Aggregation Group in which, as of  \nthe Determination Date, the sum of:  \n(1) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees  \nunder all defined benefit plans included in the group; and  \n(2) the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined  \ncontribution plans included in the group exceeds sixty  \npercent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all  \nParticipants.  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date  \notherwise provided for herein for the application of Code \u00a7 416 to  \nthis Plan (Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1983) shall be  \nextended in accordance with any federal law or regulatory  \nauthority.  \n57  \nTop-Heavy Vesting.  \nl. Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article  \nVII of the Plan, for any Top-Heavy Plan Year, the vested portion of any  \nParticipant\u2019s Accrued Benefit shall be determined on the basis of the Participant\u2019s  \nnumber of Years of Vesting Service according to the following schedule:  \nService for Vesting  \n(excluding Years of  \nService for Vesting  \nprior to effective date  \nof this Plan) Vested Percentage  \n1 year 0%  \n2 year 0%  \n3 years 100%  \nIf, in any subsequent Plan Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan,  \nthe Trustees may elect to:  \na. continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested  \nportion of any Participant\u2019s Accrued Benefit; or  \nb. revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a  \nTop-Heavy Plan pursuant to Code \u00a7 411(a)(10).
