of this Agreement, employ employees in the prosecution of work covered by this Agreement in occupations or  
upon equipment which is not covered by one of the classifications herein specified, such employment shall,  
within three (3) working days after a work assignment is made or the equipment is operated, be temporarily  
classified by the Contractor Association and the Union under the classifications contained herein which will  
more nearly fit the particular character of the employment. Temporary classifications and wage rates shall be  
immediately referred to the Cement Mason Craft Joint Adjustment Board which shall, at its next meeting,  
review and recommend usage of the proper classifications and wage rates. Either party shall thereafter have  
the right to submit a dispute under this section in the manner set forth in Article VI of this Agreement.

covered by this Agreement shall be determined by the Contractor: provided that if a Contractor, in determining  
the number of employces or the number of classifications of employees, shall lessen the number of employees or  
the number of classifications customarily used to perform any such operation, the Union may have the issue of  
such reduction in employees or in classifications determined by the grievance and arbitration procedure  
provided in Article VJ of this Agreement. In determining such disputes, consideration shall be given to the  
necessity for additional employees or classifications as well as to other pertinent factors.  
803. Because the Contractor and the Union recognize the necessity of eliminating restrictions on production and  
promoting efficiency, nothing shall be permitted that restricts production or increases the time required to do  
the work, and no limitation shall be placed upon the amount of work which an employee shall perform, nor shall
