It is understood that the AGC in no event shall'be bound as principal or held liable in any manner for any  \n(  \nbreach of this contract by any of the Employers bound by this Agreement.  \nSection 3. It is further agreed and understood that the liabilities of the Employers signing this contract shall be several,  \nand not joint. It is further understood that the liabilities of the Unions signing this contract shall be several and not joint.  \n- Section 4. Itis agreed that the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, its respective District Councils, Local  \nUnions, and their officers, representatives and agents, shail not be liable for violations of this Agreement by its local unions, and that  \nthe Employers signing this Agreement shall not be liable for actions of the AGC.  \n   \n1.1. The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the hours, wages and other conditions of employment, and to adopt  \norderty measures for the settlement of differences, thereby promoting harmonious labor relations that will benefit the industry.  \n1,2, It is mutually understood that the following terms and conditions relating to the employment of Carpenters covered  \nby this Agreement have been decided upon by means of collective bargaining, and that the following provisions will be binding upon  \nthe parties to this Agreement during the terms of this Agreement and any renewal thereof.  \n1.3. The Union signing this Agreement will be the sole bargaining representative for all Carpenters employed on work  \ncovered by this Agreement  \n1.4. If the local unions signatory to this Agreement make any agreement with any other Employer containing terms or  \nconditions, which are more favorable to such other Employer than those provided herein, then those terms and conditions shall be  \nimmediately incorporated into this Agreement and shail replace and supersede original terms that may conflict.  \n   \n2.1. This Agreement shall cover all work, as defined in this Agreement, throughout the entire State of Missouri, except St  \nLouis City, St Louis County, Jackson County, Clay County, Platte County, Ray County and Cass County. The Unions agree that any  \nEmployer who is a party to this Agreement shall have the privilege, and shall operate under the existing labor agreements, or  \nextensions thereof, which exist in the above described excepted areas, providing they accept and sign such agreements, and which  \nagreements are as follows:  \nAGC-4O/Carcenter Agreement  \n  \n(A) In St. Louis City and St. Louis County: the existing agreement between the Associated General Contractors of  \nSt. Louis and The St. Louis District Council, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.  \n(B) In Jackson County, Cass County, Clay County, Platte County, and Ray County: existing agreements or agreements  \nadopted by and between the Builders' Association of Missouri and United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners,  \nKansas City District Council.  \n2.2. It is understood, however, the provisions of this Artide are not intended as an adoption of any illegal contractual  \nprovisions or practices existing in said areas, if any do exist. On the contrary, the parties to this instrument agree that if there is any  \nconflict between this Agreement and the agreements or other practices in said other areas relating to hire or tenure of employment or  \nany term or condition of employment which may encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization, then, in that event,  \nthe provisions of this Agreement shail prevail.  \n2.3. If charters are granted in the International Union to additional local unions within a District in the State of  \nMissouri subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, then this Agreement shall be binding on such newly chartered locals.  \n2.4. The word \u201cwork\u201d when used in this Agreement means aif private and public construction, millwright work,  \nfederal and non-federal, performed in this state with the exception of building construction, for the reason that building construction is  \nseparate and distinct from all dasses of work covered by this Agreement, in respect to the terms and conditions of employment and  \nthe nature of the work as well as the class and skill of the workmen required. Building construction is hereby defined to include  \nbuilding structures, including modifications thereof or addition or repairs thereto, intended for use for shelter, protection, comfort, or  \nconvenience except as follows:  \nA. There are structures which may be building or heavy construction at the election of the Employer. Some examples  \nof these structures are: water or sewage treatment facilities, raw water intake or outfall structures, pumping  \nstations (sewage and storm).  \nB. The preparation, grading, and improvement of the property or site and the excavation for the foundations shall be  \ncovered by this Agreement in all areas of the state. The work covered by this Agreement shall indude, but shall  \nnot be restricted to, all work performed in the construction of streets and highways, airports, utilities, nver and  \nharbor work, flood control, levees, dams, pile driving, railroad and heavy construction and appurtenances, and pile  \ndike and revetment work on streams in, and along the border of Missoun.  \nIn the counties of St. Charles, Jefferson, and Franklin, the carpenter rate of pay on sewage treatment structures shall be  \nwhichever is the highest of either the building agreement or this Agreement.  \n2.5. In case of any dispute as to whether or not certain work is highway or heavy construction and thus covered by this  \nAgreement or building construction, and therefore not covered by this Agreement, the parties hereto agree to submit such dispute to  \nthe grievance procedure established in this Agreement, and be bound by the final results of such procedure.  \n2.6. This Agreement covers the Employer's asphait plants if covered by an enforceable prevailing wage determination, and  \nthe Employer's operations on the job site, not to include permanent facilities nor the Employer's home office facilities of whatever  \nnature, but shail not include professional engineers, superintendents, engineering or derical employees, guards, watchmen or  \ntimekeepers.  \n   \n3.1. The term shail mean any person, individual, corporation, or group of persons or individuais who employ  \nmen to work for them.  \n3.2. Carpenters are to be paid the wages applicable to the work performed, and in return the Employers are to receive a  \nfair and honest day\u2019s work without any slowing down or stoppage of work. There shail be no limitations as to the amount of work a  \nman shall perform during his working day.  \n3.3. There shail be no restrictions of the use of machinery, toois, equipment, appliances, or method of construction.  \n3.4. There shall be no restrictions of the use of any raw or manufactured materials or equipment, except prison made.  \n3.5. The foreman shall be the agent of the Employer.  \n3.6. The Employer may discharge any Carpenter whose work is unsatisfactory or who fails to observe the safety  \nprecautions or other rules and regulations prescribed by the Employer or this Agreement for the heaith, safety, and protection of his  \nCarpenters. The Employer agrees to participate in the safety program of the Associated General Contractors of Missoun.  \n3.7. The Employer shall provide Workmen's Compensation insurance against injury and occupational disease and  \nUnemployment Compensation protection for all employees even though not required to do so by Missouri state law.  \n   \n4.1. The Employers, recognizing that the Unions operate and maintain the only centralized sources of skilled manpower  \navailable to the construction industry within the State of Missouri and that the Union, in order to property represent the workmen must  \nbe notified of all manpower needs of and employment opportunities with the Employers both before the job begins and throughout its  \nprogress, agree as follows:  \nA. Before starting work on any job of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or over, either party may request a pre-job con-  \nference either on the job site or at some other mutually agreed upon place. The names of all subcontractors shail be furnished to the  \nUnion at such conference if known by the contractor at that time; and in any event the names of such subcontractors shall be  \nfurnished to the Union before said subcontractors shall commence work, The Employer will then outline his initial and prospective  \nmanpower requirements in all the various crafts and classifications, and the Union will inform the Employer of the probable number and  \nqualification of the men they will have available to meet the requirements. On projects of less than one million doilars  \nAIEEE Poe ne tee Arena  \n($1,000,000) the Employer shail notify the Union, having jurisdiction on the project, prior to commencing work of manpower  \nrequirements and subcontractors who will be on the project.  \nB. The Employer will, when requesting referrats from the local unton (1) specify the number of employees required; (2)  \nthe location of the project; (3) the nature and type of construction involved; (4) the work to be performed; and (5) such other infor-  \nmation as is deemed essential by the Employer in order to enable the Union to make proper referral of applicants.  \nC. Subject only to the rights of the Employer to employ and transfer men under Section 2 of this Artide, the Employer  \nshail not employ workmen, either to start a new job or to replace a workman or fill a new position on a job in progress without first  \ncalling the appropriate Union office or representative and requesting a referral of applicants for the job or jobs available. The Employer  \nshall not request the referral of more men than the number of available jobs. If he does so, those men referred but not employed  \nshal] be reimbursed in the amount of two (2) hours\u2019 pay for the job they were referred to do. The Union shall fill the Employer's  \nrequest for men qualified to perform work invoived as soon as possible.  \nD. If the Union fails for any reason to refer applicants within twenty-four (24) hours, the Employer may secure such  \nworkmen from any source available to him.  \nE. The Employer shall have the right to accept or reject any applicant for employment.  \nF. The Union shail select and refer applicants for employment without discrimination against such applicants by reason of  \nmembership or non-membership in the Union, and such selection and referral shall not be affected in any way by rules, regulations,  \nbylaws, constitutional! provisions, or any other aspect or obligation of union membership, policies or requirements.  \nG. Nothing contained herein shall deny the Union the right to select any applicant for referral on the basis of experience  \nin the industry, qualification, skill, or the Employer's preference regardless of the employee's place on the out-of-work list. The local  \nUnion shall refer workmen called for by name if such worlanen are property registered and available and have been previously laid off  \nor terminated in the area covered by this Agreement or covered by the Agreements of the Builders\u2019 of Missouri or the  \nAssociated Generat Contractors of St. Louis.  \n4.2. The Unions, recognizing that the success and efficiency of every Contractor organization in the construction industry  \ndepends in large measure on the availability to them of certain men who are skilled in the various crafts and classifications, and who _  \nhave known abilities to work in harmony and help organize an effident crew, agree as follows:  \nA. Without regard for any of the limitations imposed by the preceding Section 1 of this Artide, the Employer may bring in  \nto any job from any place or Union jurisdiction the first and all other odd numbers of the crew.  \nB. There shail be no restrictions on the transfer of men from one job site to another within the jurisdictional area of the  \nsame Carpenter District Council or the same local Union where no Council has jurisdiction.  \n4.3. In order that the Employers may be properly advised of the persons and/or offices to be notified by the Employer  \ndesiring to arrange pre-job conferences or to request a referral of applicants the Unions will promptly furnish to the office of the  \nAssociated General Contractors of Missouri a list of such persons and offices showing the territorial jurisdiction of each, office  \ntelephone number, and home telephone numbers of the Union agents involved. The Unions will keep these lists revised as necessary.  \n   \nS.1. Itis understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that as a condition of continued employment, all  \npersons who are hereafter employed by the Employer in the unit which is the subject of this Agreement shall become members of the  \nUnion not later than the eighth (8th) day following the beginning of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement,  \nwhichever is the later; that the continued employment by the Emptoyer in said unit of persons who are already members in good  \nstanding of the Union shail be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the periodic dues to the Union; and that  \nthe continued employment of persons who were in the employ of the Employer prior to the date of this Agreement and who are not  \nnow members of the Union, shall be conditioned upon those persons becoming members of the Union not later than the eighth (8th)  \nday following the execution date of this Agreement. The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such required  \ntimes shail obligate the Employer, upon written notice frem the Union to such effect and to the further effect that Union membership  \nwas available to such person on the same terms and conditions generally available to other members, to forthwith discharge such  \nperson. Further, the failure of any person to maintain his Union membership in good standing as required herein shall, upon written  \nnotice to the Employer by the Union to such effect, obligate the Employer to discharge such person.  \n5.2. The Union agrees to indemnify the Employer and hold the Employer harmless from any final determination of liability  \nto any employee by reason of the discharge of such employee, if such discharge was caused and effected by a request by the Unions  \nas provided for in the preceding paragraph of this Agreement. At a written request from the Union for an individual employee's date  \nof starting of employment, the Employer agrees to give in writing to the Union the employee's starting date. The Union shall not be  \nobligated to indemnify the Employer for any injuries or costs incurred which may be the resuit of erroneous information provided by the  \nEmployer, nor shall it be required to pay the costs of defending claims which are ultimately found to be without merit or justification.  \n5.3. The Employer shail at afl times be the sole judge as to the work to be performed, and shail furthermore determine  \nwhether such performance Is, or is not, satisfactory.  \n5.4. The Employer shall employ and use all means of safety for protection of the workmen in compliance with all safety  \nreguiations and in accordance with the law.  \n   \n6.1. The number of men to be employed is at the sole discretion of the Employer. The fact that certain dassifications  \nand rates are established does not mean that the Employer must employ carpenters for any one or all such classifications, unless, in  \nthe opinion of the Emptoyer, there is such need for such a carpenter.  \n6.2. Any employee may be shifted by the Employer from one classification of work to another classification of work,  \nprovided the Carpenter is capable of performing the other work and is paid the rate of wages for the diassification which provides the  \nhigher wage rate.  \n6.3. In order to insure composite operation, the Employer may establish a composite crew whose function is to perform  \nnecessary work on the job site.  \nA. If established, such crew will consist of the crafts in such proportions as are agreed upon by the Union and  \nEmployer as are respective to the type of work to be performed.  \nB. Members of said composite crew will work on all work, regardless of jurisdiction, assigned to said crew.  \nC. Said composite crew makeup will only apply as it pertains to each individual job site, and nothing herein is intended  \nto change the recognized craft jurisdiction of the crafts involved or the recognition thereof by the Employer.  \n6.4. All Carpenters employed under this Agreement shall be dassified in accordance with the Schedule of Wages of this  \nAgreement. Any question relative to the ciassification will be settled by the Employer and the Union representative, or as hereinafter  \nprovided.  \n6.5. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement nor grounds for discipline, discharge, or replacement of employees for  \nCarpenters covered hereunder to refuse to cross a lawful, primary picket line and perform work in any instance where the picket line  \nhas been authorized by the Union signatory to a current or previous Agreement with the Associated General Contractors of Missouri.  \n6.6. Any Employer employing Carpenters covered by.this Agreement shail furnish a shed or provide an adequate, suitable  \nplace for the safety of carpentry tools and clothing, property heated when necessary.  \n6.7. Ice water and individual cups for drinking purposes shall be supplied by the Employer within a reasonable time after  \nthe start of work, when the season of year justifies same.  \n6.8. On ail jobs, where necessary and practicable, the Employer shall provide sanitary toilet facilities for employees  \nworking on the job.  \n6.9. The Employer shall furnish rain coats, rain hats, and rubber boots, and/or overshoes for Carpenters to wear on the  \njob whenever the elements require same, and safety equipment when required by the job. The Employer shall furnish welding hood,  \ngoggles, and sleeves when required. When the job is completed, the Employee is responsible for the retum of equipment furnished by  \nthe Employer.  \n6.10. When a Carpenter is employed and has his tools on the job site, they shall be insured against loss by fire by the  \nContractor. Tools shail be replaced by Contractor or Employer when lost by burglary (forcible entry) on the job site.  \n6.11. The Employer shall furnish the following: Emery wheel, mitre box, heavy hammers, or spike maul, exceeding three  \n(3) pounds in weight or heavy steel bars exceeding twenty-four (24) inches in length, or any other tools other than those found in the  \nordinary Carpenter's tool chest, that are required on the job.  \n6.12. A. Whenever a Carpenter is working at a location where no other men are working, and if that Carpenter's safety  \nrequires that another person be within call, an additional person shall work within cail.  \nB. The Employer in recognition of the fact that an effective accident prevention program is essential, not only to the  \nsafety and welfare of the employees but to the efficient prosecution of the work, agrees to make effective use of acddent prevention  \ninformation and aids available from the association and to insure that such information and educational material are made available to  \nindividual employees on the project.  \n6,13. When a Carpenter goes on a job to work, he must have his tools sharp and in good working order; but he-shail be  \nallowed to keep his tools sharp and in good working condition on the job and shall be paid time for same.  \n6.14. When the Employer requests an employee to take a welding test for the purpose of certification, cost of the testing  \nshall be borne by the Employer.  \n6.15. Maintenance of forms erected by Carpenters if required during pouring of concrete shall be done by Carpenters.  \n   \n7.1.

The overtime rate  \nshall be one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular hourly rate.  \n(C) The regular work day shail be either eight (8) or ten (10) hours. The Employer shall give notice the prior week as to  \nwhether the next work week shail be worked eight (8) or ten (10) hours per day. New employees covered by this Agreement who  \nhave begun work for the Employer during the middle of a work week and are scheduled to work Friday or Saturday shail work either at  \nthe normal rate of pay (if working make up days) or at the premium rate of pay as determined by the rate of pay being received by the  \nregular crew which have been employed the entire pay period on the project.  \n(D) If a job can't work 40 hours Monday through Friday because of indement weather or other conditions beyond the  \ncontrol of the Employer, Friday or Saturday may be worked as a make up day at straight time (if working 4-10's). Saturday may be  \nworked as a make up day at straight time (if working 5-8's). Workmen unable to work make up days shall not be terminated or  \notherwise penalized for not working make up days.  \nAGC-MG/Carpenter Agreement  \n(E) In the event an empioyee works a make up day when he has worked less than 40 hours he shall work that full day  \nprovided that work is not stopped because of inclement weather or conditions beyond the contro! of the Employer. When an Employer  \nworks a project on a four (4) ten (10) hour day work schedule, the Employer will not bring in any other crew to work make up days on  \nthe project while not calling in the normal crew that had been scheduled for the project. Make up days shall not be utilized for days  \nlost of Holidays.  \n7.2. A thirty (30) minute tunch break, without pay, between the third and sixth hour will be allowed each employee, and  \nthe employee will be paid time and one-half for working through his lunch period and will be allowed a short time to eat.  \n7.3. A WORKDAY IS TO BEGIN AT THE OPTION OF THE EMPLOYER BUT NOT LATER THAN 11:00 AM. EXCEPT WHEN  \nINCLEMENT WEATHER, REQURIEMENTS OF THE OWNER OR OTHER CONDITIONS BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF THE  \nEMPLOYER PREVENT WORK. ANY OTHER WORKING HOURS ESTABLISHED BY THE EMPLOYER CONTRARY TO NORMAL HOURS  \n"], ["ESTABLISHED IN THIS ARTICLE, WILL REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYEE TO RECEIVE FIFTY CENTS ($.50) PER HOUR PREMIUM. EXCEPT  \nAS WORKED AS A MAKE-UP DAY, TIME ON SATURDAY SHALL BE WORKED AT ONE AND ONE-HALF (1 1/2 ) TIMES THE REGULAR  \nRATE.  \n", "Work performed on Sunday shall be at two (2) times the regular rate, except as provided on shift work or as provided for  \n7.4. The following days are recognized as holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,  \nThanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. If a holiday fails on a Sunday, it shail be observed on the following Monday. If a holiday fails  \non a Saturday, it shall be observed on the preceding Friday. No work shall be performed on Labor Day except in case of jeopardy to  \nwork under construction. This rule is applied to protect Labor Day. When a holiday falls during the normal work week, Monday  \nthrough Friday, it shail be counted as eight (8) hours toward the forty (40) hour week; however, no reimbursement for this eight (8)  \nhours is to be paid the workman unless worked. If workmen are required to work the above enumerated holidays or days observed as  \nsuch, they shail receive double the regular rate of pay for such work.  \n7.5. The Contractor may elect to work one, two or three shifts on any work covered by this Agreement. When operating  \non more than one shift, the shifts shall be known as the day shift, swing shift, and graveyard shift as such terms are recognized in the  \nindustry. The Contractor shail give twenty-four (24) hour's notice prior to any change in starting time in the work day or work shift.  \nA. When two shifts are worked, the shifts will consist of eight (8) hours exctusive of lunch time. When three shifts are  \nworked on any operation, the first shift or day shift will consist of eight (8) hours exclusive of lunch time; the second or swing shift  \nshail consist of seven and one-half (7 1/2) hours\u2019 work for eight (8) hours\u2018s pay, exclusive of lunch time; and the third or graveyard  \nshift shail consist of seven (7) hours' work for eight (8) hours\u2019 pay, exclusive of lunch time. All time worked in excess thereof shail be  \npaid at the overtime rate. All time worked in excess of normal shifts shall be considered overtime.  \nB. Multiple shift (the two or three shift) operation will not be construed on the entire project if at any time it is deemed  \nadvisable and necessary for the Employer to multiple shift a specific operation.  \n   \nC. No shift shail be started between midnight and six a.m. except the graveyard shift on a three-shift operation, or except  \nin unusual or emergency situations, or by agreement between the Emptoyer and the Union.  \n7.6. Workmen shail report for work each working day except when the Employer has notified them not to do so. It shall  \nbe the duty of the Contractor to notify the employees if there is no work on the following day.

The individual Employer  \nand the Union may mutuaily agree to other and additional means of notification of employees.  \n7.8. Show-up time hours and guaranteed hours after put to work will be regarded as hours worked for the purpose of  \ncomputing the forty-hour work week.  \n7.9. If the Contractor requires the men to remain on the job during a stoppage of work, they must be paid continuous  \ntime.  \n   \n8.1. Hourty rates of wages for each classification are set forth in the attached Schedule of Wage Rates, and the rates of  \nwages shown in that schedule shall apply to all work and to every Carpenter covered by this Agreement. If a wage predetermination  \nIssued by the State Division of Labor Standards or the U.S. Department of Labor is less than those in the Schedule of Rates, the  \npredetermined rate shall be the starting rate for the project. On each anniversary date of this Agreement, the amount of increase  \nprovided for under this Agreement shail be added to the predetermined rate.  \n8.2. The Unions agree that no demand for any increase in any wage rate above that specified in the Schedule of Wage  \nRates will be made on the job.  \n8.3. Wages, in cash or collectible check, shall be paid to Carpenters weekly at the end of the shift not later than five (S)  \nwork days after the pay period, unless approval of payrolls by governmenta! agencies prevent such payment at that time. Check stubs  \nshall show ail overtime hours and straight time hours, total wages and itemized deductions. Failure on the part of the Employer to  \ncomply with this provision shall entitle the Carpenter to one (1) day's pay for each twenty-four (24) hours or portion thereof from the  \ndate of the required pay day provided the delay is occasioned by the willful negligence of the Employer or his agents.  \n8.4. (A) Rate of wages and fringe benefits, as set forth in this Agreement in effect on the date an Employer signatory to  \nthis Agreement bids on a project that are equal to the wage determinations, shail remain in effect for the duration of the work on said  \nproject, but not to exceed a period of more than twenty-four (24) months from the bid date. On the second anniversary of the project,  \nAGC-4O0/Carpenter Agreement 3  \nif the project continues, the wages and fringes will be increased by an amount equal to the effective wage and fringe increases in the  \nfirst year after the date of the original bid letting. The same procedure shail apply on the third anniversary of the date of the bid renting  \nand on all subsequent anniversaries. This Section 4(A) shail not apply in St Charles and Jefferson Counties.  \n(B) Work on projects bid under any previous AGC of Missouri agreements or addenda shail continue for a period of two  \n(2) years at the old wage and fringe benefit rates. On the second anniversary of the project, if the project continues, the wages and  \nfringes will be increased by an amount equal to the effective wage and fringe increases in the first year after the date of the original bid  \nletting. The same procedure shail apply on the third anniversary of the date of the bid letting and on all subsequent anniversaries.  \n8.5. In the event of multiple layoffs, arrangements may be made between the Employer and the local Union for pay  \nchecks to be mailed to employees within forty-eight (48) hours. The employees shall furnish the correct mailing address to the  \nEmployer before jeaving the job.  \n8.6. If a Carpenter quits of his own accord, he shall wait for his pay until the next regular pay day.  \n8.7. A Carpenter who is discharged or off shall be paid in full without undue delay, or the provisions of Section 8.3 of  \nthis Artide will apply.  \n8.8. If the Employer enters into a contract which specifies a definite maximum wage in compliance with the requirements  \nof any law, executive order, or regulation and if such wages are different from the wages specified in this Agreement, then the wages  \nin this Agreement shall not be in effect during the effective period of such law, executive order, or regulation.  \n8.9. If bridge river piers or superstructure, pile dike and/or revetment jobs covered by this Agreement indude work under  \none contract on both banks of the stream, and if the wage scales are not the same on both sides of the stream, the higher rate shall  \nbe paid on that job.  \n   \n9.1. The Union shal! have the right to appoint a steward on each job and there shail be no discrimination against any Car-  \npenter serving as steward. He shall have the right to investigate all matters covered by this Agreement.  \n9.2. The steward of the job shail work when there is any work being done under his classification requiring a second  \nCarpenter. When necessary to work overtime, the steward shail be one of the men that work, if he so desires.  \n9.3. The steward shall not be discharged except for incompetence or cause or when the job is completed,  \n9.4.
