\nX1V  \n2017-2021 BASIC AGREEMENT  \nThis Agreement, effective December 1, 2016, is between the  \n30 Major League Clubs and the Major League Baseball Players  \nAssociation (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cPlayers Association\u201d or  \nthe \u201cAssociation\u2019).  \nIn making this Agreement the Association represents that it contracts  \nfor and on behalf of the Major League Baseball Players and individu-  \nals who may become Major League Baseball Players during the term  \nof this Agreement, and the Clubs represent that they contract for and  \non behalf of themselves, any additional Clubs which may become  \nmembers of the Major Leagues and the successors thereof.  \nARTICLE I\u2014lIntent and Purpose  \nThe intent and purpose of the Clubs and the Association (hereinafter  \n\u201cthe Parties\u201d) in entering into this Agreement is to set forth their agree-  \nment on certain terms and conditions of employment of all Major  \nLeague Baseball Players for the duration of this Agreement. Each of  \nthe Parties acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of the other  \nParty and agrees to discharge its responsibilities under this Agreement.  \n"], ["ARTICLE  \n", "The Clubs recognize the Association as the sole and exclusive collec-  \ntive bargaining agent for all Major League Players, and individuals  \nwho may become Major League Players during the term of this Agree-  \nment, with regard to all terms and conditions of employment, provided  \nthat an individual Player shall be entitled to negotiate in accordance  \nwith the provisions set forth in this Agreement (1) an individual salary  \nover and above the minimum requirements established by this Agree-  \nment and (2) Special Covenants to be included in an individual Uni-  \nform Player\u2019s Contract, which actually or potentially provide  \nadditional benefits to the Player.  \nARTICLE UI\u2014Uniform Player\u2019s Contract  \nThe form of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract between a Club and a  \nPlayer is attached hereto as Appendix A, which is incorporated herein  \nby reference and made a part hereof.  \nDuring the term of this Agreement, no other form of Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract will be utilized. Should the provisions of any Contract  \nbetween any individual Player and any of the Clubs be inconsistent  \nwith the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement  \nshall govern. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article IV below,  \nnothing herein contained shall limit the right of any Club and Player to  \nenter into Special Covenants in the space provided in a manner not  \ninconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The termination of  \nthis Agreement shall not impair, limit or terminate the rights and duties  \nof any Club or Player under any Contract between any individual  \nPlayer and any of the Clubs.  \nARTICLE IV\u2014Negotiation and Approval of Contracts  \nA Player, if he so desires, may designate an agent to conduct on  \nhis behalf, or to assist him in, the negotiation of an individual salary  \nand/or Special Covenants to be included in his Uniform Player\u2019s Con-  \ntract with any Club, provided such agent has been certified to the  \nClubs by the Association as authorized to act as a Player Agent for  \nsuch purposes.  \nThe Association shall provide the Office of the Commissioner with a  \ncomprehensive list of the certified Player Agent(s) whom each Player  \nhas designated to act on his behalf for the purposes described in this  \nArticle IV. The Association also shall provide the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner with any changes to such Player Agent designations, includ-  \ning the Player Agent designations of Players who have been added to  \na Major League roster, on a weekly basis. In addition, the Association  \nwill provide the Office of the Commissioner with notice of any revi-  \nsions to its regulations governing Player Agents, and a complete copy  \nof the revised regulations.  \nIf the Association has notified the Office of the Commissioner that a  \nPlayer has designated a certified Player Agent or Agents to act on his  \nbehalf for the purposes described in this Article IV, no Club may nego-  \ntiate or attempt to negotiate an individual salary and/or Special  \nCovenants to be included in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract with any  \nPlayer Agent(s) other than such Player Agent(s). No agent designation  \nshall be considered effective unless it was transmitted from the Asso-  \nciation to the Office of the Commissioner.  \nA Club may require a Player\u2019s physical presence only once during con-  \ntract negotiations. This limitation shall not apply to telephone confer-  \nence calls, at reasonable times, with a Player and his certified Player  \nAgent. A Player required to be physically present during negotiations  \nduring the offseason shall be entitled to be paid by the Club for round-  \ntrip first-class transportation and first-class hotel costs, and a daily  \nmeal and tip allowance, at the same rate as the in-season meal and tip  \nallowance provided under Article VII(B) for the immediately preced-  \ning season, for that day and any additional travel days.  \nUpon execution of a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract by the Club and  \nPlayer, the Club promptly shall submit the Contract, in duplicate, to  \nthe Commissioner for approval. Within 20 days of receipt, the Com-  \nmissioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract (with notice to the  \nAssociation), or provide the Association with a written explanation of  \nwhy the Contract has not been approved. This period is extended to  \n30 days if a Contract is received by the Commissioner between Feb-  \nruary 15 and April 15. Within ten days after the Commissioner is to  \nprovide an explanation of why a Contract has not been approved, the  \nCommissioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract. (See Attach-  \nment 1.) Any Grievance challenging the Commissioner\u2019s conduct  \nunder this Article shall be handled by the Parties on an expedited basis  \nwith documents being exchanged within 10 days of the filing of the  \nGrievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of the filing of the  \nGrievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with an opinion to follow,  \nif necessary) no later than 15 days following the commencement of  \nthe hearing.  \nThe Office of the Commissioner will provide copies of all newly  \nsigned and approved Uniform Player\u2019s Contracts as frequently as is  \nfeasible, but no less frequently than on a monthly basis. Contracts not  \nyet approved or disapproved by the Commissioner will be made avail-  \nable to the Association upon its request.  \nARTICLE V\u2014Scheduling  \nA. Length of Season  \nDuring the term of this Agreement, each Club shall be scheduled to  \nplay 162 games during each championship season. The 2017 champion-  \nship season will not be scheduled over a period of less than 178 days  \nor more than 183 days. Beginning in 2018, each championship season  \nwill not be scheduled over a period of less than 182 days or more than  \n187 days. If, however, any Club\u2019s championship season is scheduled to  \nopen with a game played outside of the United States and Canada, and  \nthe scheduling of such a game causes the championship season for  \nthose Clubs to be scheduled over a period of more than 183 days or  \n187 days beginning in 2018 (an \u201cInternational Opener\u2019), then the  \nchampionship season for all other Clubs shall commence on the date  \nof the first regularly scheduled championship season game within the  \n183 days (or 187 days beginning in 2018) preceding the regularly  \nscheduled end of the championship season. See Article VI(C).  \nFollowing completion of each championship season, ten Clubs shall  \nqualify for Post-Season play: the three Division Champions in each  \nLeague and the two other Clubs in each League with the highest per-  \ncentage of wins in the championship season (Wild Card Clubs). In  \neach League, the two Wild Card Clubs shall play a single elimination  \ngame. Thereafter, the three Division Champions in each League and  \nthe winner of the Wild Card Game in that League shall engage in a best  \nof five (seven if the Division Series is expanded) Division Series. See  \nAttachment 25. The winners of the Division Series in each League  \nshall then engage in a best of seven League Championship Series, and  \nthe winners of the two League Championship Series shall engage in a  \nbest of seven World Series. If during the term of this Agreement the  \nformat of the Wild Card Games, the Division Series, the League  \nChampionship Series or the World Series is proposed to be changed,  \nthe Clubs shall give the Association notice thereof and shall negotiate  \nthe proposed change with the Association; provided, however, that if  \nduring the term of this Agreement the Division Series is proposed to be  \nchanged to the best of seven games, the Clubs shall give the Associa-  \ntion notice thereof and shall negotiate with the Association but the  \nClubs shall not be required to negotiate with the Association over con-  \ntributions to the Players\u2019 pool beyond those specified in Article X. Any  \nfailure to play the Wild Card Games, the Division Series, the League  \nChampionship Series or the World Series, in whole or in part, by rea-  \nson of causes beyond the control of the Clubs, shall not constitute a  \nchange in the format of such Series or a breach of this Agreement.  \nDuring any negotiations between the Parties on the subject of a  \nrenewal of or successor to this Agreement, the Clubs agree that any  \nproposal made by the Association to reduce the number of champion-  \nship season games shall not be resisted on the ground of commitments  \nmade by the Clubs in local television and radio contracts. However,  \nnothing herein shall interfere with or limit the right of the Clubs to  \nresist such proposal on any other ground or the right of either Party to  \ntake any other position in future negotiations on this or any other  \nproper subject for collective bargaining.  \nB. Championship Schedules  \nOn or before July | of each year, copies of the tentative championship  \nschedules of the Major Leagues for the next ensuing season shall be  \nsubmitted to the Association for review. The Office of the Commis-  \nsioner will use best efforts to include times of games. The Association  \nshall complete its review not later than September 1. Thereafter, the  \nOffice of the Commissioner will promptly notify the Association of  \nproposed changes in the tentative championship schedules submitted  \nto the Association above.  \nC. Additional Scheduling Agreements  \n(1) Split doubleheaders may be included in the original schedule  \npursuant to Section C(14) below. Provided that neither of the Clubs  \ninvolved in the proposed rescheduled game has already played or  \nhas been rescheduled to play a total of three split doubleheaders  \n(exclusive of any splits in the original schedule) in that champion-  \nship season:  \n(a) each Club shall have the right to reschedule any postponed  \ngame as a split doubleheader when ticket sales for the game at the  \ntime of postponement exceed, in any respect, the number of com-  \nparable tickets available to be exchanged by the Club for the bal-  \nance of the championship season, and both the postponed and  \nrescheduled game occur in the last regularly scheduled series  \nbetween the two Clubs at the Club\u2019s park; and  \n(b) when there is no practical alternative to doing so, the  \nBoston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs shall have the right to  \nreschedule a postponed game as a split doubleheader to be played  \nin, respectively, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, even if the cri-  \nteria set out in subparagraph (a) above are not met. Scheduling a  \npostponed game as part of a conventional doubleheader will not  \nbe considered a practical alternative.  \nThe Association shall have the exclusive right to approve the addi-  \ntional rescheduling of postponed games as split doubleheaders in  \ncircumstances that are not automatically permitted by subparagraph  \n(a) or (b) above. If the Association agrees to a split doubleheader  \npursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be scheduled for the  \nvisiting Club\u2019s next visit to the home Club\u2019s park absent good  \ncause and agreement between the Office of the Commissioner and  \nthe Association.  \n(2) One-day stands will not be scheduled except as doubleheaders  \n(to be followed by an open day) or as \u201copeners,\u201d provided that any  \ngame played on the day following the opener does not start before  \n4 P.M.

If the  \noff-day occurs after the start of the championship season, the Club  \nmay hold a voluntary workout or travel on the off-day. If the off-day  \noccurs prior to the start of the championship season, a Club may not  \nhold a workout, voluntary or otherwise.  \n(5) The following shall apply to the scheduling or rescheduling  \nof games prior to day doubleheaders:  \n(a) a game will not be scheduled to start after 5 P.M. if either  \nClub is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day; and  \n6  \n(b) a game will not be rescheduled to start after 5 P.M. if  \neither Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day  \nunless such rescheduling is necessary to complete the champion-  \nship schedule.  \n(6) Day games shall not be scheduled or (unless necessary to  \ncomplete the championship schedule) rescheduled to start before  \n1 P.M., except as provided in paragraph (7) below, and except that  \nsuch games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between  \nNoon and | P.M., if each Club meets one of the following two  \nconditions:  \n(a) if an off-day occurred the previous day; or  \n(b) if a game were played in the same city within the previous  \n24 hours.  \nDay games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between Noon  \nand | P.M. on holidays if each Club meets one of the above con-  \nditions or if an afternoon game starting not later than 5 P.M. ora  \ndoubleheader starting not later than 1:30 P.M. was played in  \nanother city the previous day and the in-flight time required is 1'/2  \nhours or less.  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, day games may start at Noon on the  \nOpening Day of the championship season.  \n(7) With the approval of the Commissioner, not more than 4  \ngames per League per year may be scheduled or rescheduled to start  \nbetween 10:30 A.M. and Noon, if, with respect to both Clubs, the  \nconditions stated in paragraph (6) above with respect to scheduling  \nand rescheduling of day games between Noon and | P.M. are met.  \n(8) For the 2017 championship season, a Club may not be sched-  \nuled to play a road game starting after 5 P.M. if such game is fol-  \nlowed by a home off-day, except under the following circumstances:  \n(a) the in-flight time between Major League cities for the  \nClub traveling home to an off-day is two hours or less;  \n(b) the in-flight time for the visiting Club traveling home to an  \noff-day is more than 2 hours and less than or equal to 2 hours and  \n10 minutes in length, and the travel does not require any West-to-  \nEast change in time zones;  \n(c) the game is scheduled pursuant to a national television  \nagreement; or  \n(d) the visiting Club is playing the Texas Rangers in Arlington,  \nTexas on or after June 1.  \nFor the 2018 championship season, the latest possible start time  \nfor getaway games on days when the visiting Club travels to a home  \noff-day or either Club travels to another game the following day shall  \nbe determined by taking the portion of the in-flight time that exceeds  \n2'/2 hours, and subtracting that amount of time from 7 P.M. However,  \nthe foregoing sentence shall not apply to getaway games that are  \nbroadcast on ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u2019; getaway games  \nplayed in Arlington, Texas after June 1 (unless the Texas Rangers  \nmove to a climate-controlled home ballpark), or rescheduled games.  \nAdditionally, each Club that is limited by its stadium lease agree-  \nment or governmental regulation in the number of day games it may  \nplay shall receive one exception annually to the rules set forth in this  \nArticle V(C)(8), provided that the Club has applied for and has been  \ndenied a waiver by its lessor or the relevant governmental authority.  \nFor each subsequent season covered by this Agreement, unless  \nthe Parties agree otherwise, the Association will notify the Commis-  \nsioner\u2019s Office in writing on or before September | in the year prior  \nto the season whether it elects to (a) continue the terms in place for  \nthe 2018 season set forth above; or (b) revert back to the terms in  \nplace for the 2017 season set forth above.  \nAll references to \u201cin-flight time\u201d in this Article V shall be as set  \nforth in Appendix C.  \n(9) For the 2017 championship season, getaway games shall not  \nbe scheduled or rescheduled to start later than 5 P.M. if either Club  \nis required to travel for a day game the following day between cities  \nfor which the in-flight time is more than 1!/2 hours.

A  \nrained-out game may be rescheduled to an open date in the same  \nseries, or to an open date at the end of the same series, if: (a) the  \nopen date is a road off-day for the visiting Club, and (b) the resched-  \nuling does not result in the home team playing more than twenty-  \nfour consecutive dates without an open day.  \n(13) Commencing with its second scheduled championship sea-  \nson game, a Club shall not be scheduled for more than two open  \ndays in any seven-day period. No Club may be scheduled to have  \nmore than ten open days prior to the twelfth week of the champion-  \nship season.

Sep-  \narate votes shall be required with regard to each game for which a  \nwaiver is sought. A waiver granted pursuant to this provision, as  \nwell as a waiver granted by the Association pursuant to Section  \nC(1), shall not constitute a precedent with regard to future waiver  \nrequests. With respect to the rescheduling of any such game, and  \nall games rescheduled pursuant to Section C(1), the Club(s) shall  \nconsult with the Association concerning the actual date and time  \nof such rescheduled game. The Club(s) shall use best efforts to  \nnotify the Association in advance of notifying the Players on the  \nClub(s) affected.  \nD. Interleague Play  \nEach Club may be scheduled to play up to twenty Interleague games  \nduring each championship season. In each Interleague game at an  \nAmerican League park, the Designated Hitter shall be used; at each  \nInterleague game at a National League park, the Designated Hitter  \nshall not be used.  \nInterleague play will be scheduled on a rotating division format (e.g.  \nAmerican League East vs. National League East; American League  \nEast vs. National League Central), but may also include no more than  \none three- or four-game series, or two two-game series, each season  \nbetween prime interleague rivals.

Maximum Salary Reduction  \n(1) Maximum Salary Cut Rule  \nA Club may not tender, sign or renew a Player under reserve to  \nthe Club pursuant to Article XX(A) of this Agreement and para-  \ngraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract to a Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract that provides a salary for:  \n13  \n(a) Major League service that constitutes a reduction in  \nexcess of 20% of his salary for Major League service in the pre-  \nvious season or in excess of 30% of his salary for Major League  \nservice two seasons prior to the first season covered by the new  \ncontract; or  \n(b) Minor League service as calculated under Section 2(c)  \nbelow that constitutes a reduction in excess of 50% of his salary  \nfor Minor League service in the previous season.  \n(2) Calculation of Previous Seasons Salaries  \n(a) Single-Year Contract\u2014Previous Major League Salaries  \nIn order to calculate a Player\u2019s salary for Major League serv-  \nice in the previous season or two seasons prior to the first season  \ncovered by the new contract, the following steps shall be taken:  \n(1) Base Salary. The Player\u2019s \u201cBase Salary\u201d shall be the  \nrate of pay for Major League service contained in paragraph 2  \nof the contract, or in any special covenant thereto. The Base  \nSalary shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraphs  \n2(a)(i1)-(v) below to determine the Player\u2019s salary.  \n(11) Deferred Compensation Adjustment. If any deferred  \ncompensation is included in the Base Salary, the Base Salary  \nshall be adjusted to reflect the discounted present value of the  \ndeferred amount.  \n(111) Signing Bonus Adjustment. Ifthe contract contains a  \nsigning bonus, the signing bonus shall be added to the Base  \nSalary. If any portion of the signing bonus 1s deferred, the  \npresent value of the signing bonus shall be used for purposes  \nof the calculation in this paragraph 2(a)(i11).  \n(iv) Performance Bonus Adjustment. If the contract con-  \ntains performance bonuses, regardless of whether or not any  \nportion of the bonus 1s earned, the Club has the option of either  \nadding the entire bonus (both earned and unearned portions) in  \nthe Base Salary, or excluding it from the Base Salary but  \nrepeating the bonus on the same terms.  \n(v) Other Forms of Compensation Adjustment. If the con-  \ntract contains any other forms of compensation, the determina-  \n14  \ntion of whether the compensation shall be included in the  \nsalary calculation will be determined in accordance with the  \nfacts in each situation. Amounts that are payable on the occur-  \nrence of a specific event or events shall not be included in  \nBase Salary if such event or events fail to occur within the  \nspecified period. If the item is included, the Club has the  \noption of either including the value of the item in the Base  \nSalary, or excluding it from Base Salary but repeating the item  \non the same terms.  \nThe following is a nonexhaustive list of other forms of com-  \npensation:  \n(A) payments for performing services for a Club in addi-  \ntion to skilled services as a baseball player;  \n(B) cash, lump sum, payments made in accordance with  \nagreed upon special covenants to compensate for trading a  \nPlayer, releasing a Player, etc.;  \n(C) the value of individual property rights granted to a  \nPlayer by a Club;  \n(D) any compensation for postactive Major League  \nBaseball playing career employment; and  \n(E) other payments or things of value not specifically  \nmade for performance as a Major League Baseball Player.  \n(b) Multi-Year Contract\u2014Previous Major League Salaries  \nIn order to calculate a Player\u2019s salary for Major League serv-  \nice in the previous season or two seasons prior to the first season  \ncovered by the new contract, the following steps shall be taken:  \n(1) Base Salary  \n(A) If the annual rates of pay contained in paragraph 2  \nof the contract, or in any special covenant thereto, satisfy  \nthe maximum salary cut rule, the rate of pay stipulated in  \nthe contract for the year at issue shall be the Player\u2019s Base  \nSalary.  \n(B) Ifthe annual rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of  \nthe contract, or in any special covenant thereto, do not satisfy  \n15  \nthe maximum salary cut rule, the average annual value  \n(\u201cAAV\u201d) of the contract shall be the Player\u2019s Base Salary  \nfor the year at issue. The AAV shall be calculated by aver-  \naging the rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of the con-  \ntract (or any special covenants thereto) for each year of the  \ncontract. If deferred compensation is contained in any year  \nof the multi-year contract, the present value of the deferred  \namount will be used for purposes of calculating the AAV.  \n(C) The Base Salary shall be adjusted in accordance  \nwith paragraphs 2(b)(11)-(iv) below to determine a Player\u2019s  \nsalary.  \n(11) Signing Bonus Adjustment. If the contract contains a  \nsigning bonus, the bonus, irrespective of payment dates, shall  \nbe prorated and included in equal amounts as part of the Base  \nSalary for each year of the contract. If any portion of the sign-  \ning bonus is deferred beyond the expiration of the contract, the  \npresent value of the signing bonus shall be used for purposes  \nof the calculation in this paragraph 2(b)(11).  \n(111) Performance Bonus Adjustment. If the year of the  \nmulti-year contract at issue contains performance bonuses,  \nthey shall be treated in the same manner as in paragraph  \n2(a)(iv) above.  \n(iv) Other Forms of Compensation Adjustment.

Ifasingle year contract, or the rel-  \nevant year of a multi-year contract, does not contain a separate  \nrate of pay for Minor League service, the Player\u2019s salary for  \nMinor League service in the previous season shall be deemed  \nto be the same as his salary for performing Major League serv-  \nice as calculated pursuant to paragraph 2(a) or 2(b) above.  \n16  \n(11) Contracts that Contain a Separate Rate of Pay for Minor  \nLeague Service.  \n(A) If a single-year contract, or the relevant year of a  \nmulti-year contract, contains a separate rate of pay for  \nMinor League service, and the rate of pay is higher than the  \nMajor League minimum salary for the preceding season  \ncontained in Article VI(A)(1), the Player\u2019s salary for Minor  \nLeague service in the previous season shall be the rate of  \npay for Minor League service that is stipulated in the con-  \ntract. For purposes of this paragraph 2(c)(11)(A), the stipu-  \nlated rate of pay for Minor League service contained in the  \ncontract shall not be adjusted to account for a signing  \nbonus, performance or award bonuses, or any other forms  \nof compensation provided for by the contract.  \n(B) If a single-year contract, or the relevant year of a  \nmulti-year contract, contains a separate rate of pay for  \nMinor League service, and that rate of pay is lower than  \nthe Major League minimum salary for the prior season  \ncontained in Article VI(A)(1), the Player\u2019s salary for  \nMinor League service in the previous season shall be the  \ngreater of the total amount of the Player\u2019s actual baseball  \nsalary earnings (defined below) in that season, or the rate  \nof pay stipulated for Minor League service in the Player\u2019s  \ncontract for that season. A Player\u2019s \u201cactual baseball salary  \nearnings\u201d for purposes of this paragraph 2(c)(11)(B) shall  \ninclude only those amounts paid to the Player as salary for  \nperforming services in the Major or Minor Leagues, and  \nshall not include signing bonuses, performance or award  \nbonuses, or any other forms of compensation provided for  \nby the contract.  \n(d) Fines or Suspensions  \nThe calculation of a Player\u2019s previous year salaries shall  \ninclude amounts which were not paid to a Player for the season  \nby reason of any fine or suspension which may have been  \nimposed on the Player, or by reason of any deduction from  \nsalary.  \n17  \n(ec) Option Years  \nOption years shall be included as a year of the contract if the  \noption had been fully exercised at the time of the tender, signing  \nor renewal.  \n(3) Disputes  \nIn the event of a dispute regarding a contract tender, signing or  \nrenewal with respect to any form of additional compensation  \nreferred to in paragraph (2)(a)(v) or 2(b)(iv) above, either the  \nPlayer or Club may file a Grievance in order to obtain a determi-  \nnation with respect thereto as the exclusive means of resolving  \nsuch dispute, and both parties shall be bound by the resulting  \ndecision. The contract tender, signing or renewal shall be altered  \nas necessary to conform to the decision, and such tender, signing  \nor renewal shall remain valid.  \nC. Standard Length of Season  \nFor the purpose of calculating a Player\u2019s daily rate of pay, a champion-  \nship season shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first reg-  \nularly scheduled championship season game and to conclude on the  \ndate of the last regularly scheduled championship season game. This  \nrule shall apply uniformly to all Players and all Clubs, notwithstanding  \ndifferences in a particular Club\u2019s schedule, except as provided other-  \nwise by Article V(A) and Article XXV.  \nD. Salary Continuation\u2014Military Encampment  \nPayment of Player salaries shall be continued throughout any period in  \nwhich a Player is required to attend a regularly scheduled military  \nencampment of the Reserve of the Armed Forces or of the National  \nGuard during the Club\u2019s playing season.  \nE.

In the event they are unable to agree  \nby January | in any year, they jointly shall request that the Ameri-  \ncan Arbitration Association furnish them lists of prominent, profes-  \nsional arbitrators. Upon receipt of such lists, the arbitrators shall be  \nselected by alternately striking names from the lists. All cases shall  \nbe assigned to three-arbitrator panels. The Association and the LRD  \nshall designate one arbitrator to serve as the panel chair.  \n(6) Location of Hearings. The single hearing site for each year  \nwill be agreed upon by the Parties with preference being given to  \neither Los Angeles, Tampa/Orlando, or Phoenix.  \n(7) Conduct of Hearings. The hearings shall be conducted on a  \nprivate and confidential basis. Each of the parties to a case shall be  \nlimited to one hour for initial presentation and one-half hour for  \nrebuttal and summation. Cross-examination of witnesses shall not  \ncount against the aforesaid time limitations, and such time limita-  \ntions may be extended by the arbitration panel for good cause.  \nThe parties shall exchange all written materials to be utilized in  \ntheir respective initial presentations at the outset of a hearing. The  \norder of presentation shall be as follows:  \n20  \n(a) Player\u2019s initial presentation;  \n(b) Club\u2019s initial presentation;  \n(c) Player\u2019s rebuttal and summation;  \n(d) Club\u2019s rebuttal and summation;  \n(e) Player\u2019s surrebuttal, which shall be very brief and offered  \nto respond to new issues raised during the Club\u2019s rebuttal; and  \n(f) If requested by the Club, the Panel may, at its discretion,  \nallow the Club very brief surrebuttal to respond to new issues  \nraised by the Player.  \nNotwithstanding this order of presentation, neither party shall  \ncarry the burden of proof.  \n(8) Continuances, Adjournments or Postponements. There  \nshall be no continuances or adjournments of a hearing, but the com-  \nmencement of a hearing may be postponed by the arbitration panel  \nupon the application of either the Player or Club based upon a show-  \ning of substantial cause. Any request for the postponement of a  \nscheduled hearing shall be made to the panel chair in writing, with  \ncopies to the Association and the LRD. Disclosure of individual  \nvotes by panel members shall be in accordance with paragraph (13)  \nbelow.  \n(9) Hearing Costs. The Player and Club shall divide equally the  \ncosts of the hearing, and each shall be responsible for his own  \nexpenses and those of his counsel or other representatives.  \n(10) Criteria  \n(a) The criteria will be the quality of the Player\u2019s contribu-  \ntion to his Club during the past season (including but not limited  \nto his overall performance, special qualities of leadership and  \npublic appeal), the length and consistency of his career contribu-  \ntion, the record of the Player\u2019s past compensation, comparative  \nbaseball salaries (see paragraph (11) below for confidential  \nsalary data), the existence of any physical or mental defects on  \nthe part of the Player, and the recent performance record of the  \nClub including but not limited to its League standing and atten-  \n21  \ndance as an indication of public acceptance (subject to the exclu-  \nsion stated in subparagraph (b)(1) below). Except as set forth in  \nsubsections 10(b) and 10(c) below, any evidence may be submit-  \nted which is relevant to the above criteria, and the arbitration  \npanel shall assign such weight to the evidence as shall appear  \nappropriate under the circumstances. The arbitration panel shall,  \nexcept for a Player with five or more years of Major League  \nservice, give particular attention, for comparative salary pur-  \nposes, to the contracts of Players with Major League service not  \nexceeding one annual service group above the Player\u2019s annual  \nservice group. This shall not limit the ability of a Player or his  \nrepresentative, because of special accomplishment, to argue the  \nequal relevance of salaries of Players without regard to service,  \nand the arbitration panel shall give whatever weight to such  \nargument as is deemed appropriate.  \n(b) Evidence of the following shall not be admissible:  \n(1) The financial position of the Player and the Club;  \n(11) Press comments, testimonials or similar material bear-  \ning on the performance of either the Player or the Club, except  \nthat recognized annual Player awards for playing excellence  \nshall not be excluded;  \n(111) Offers made by either Player or Club prior to arbitra-  \ntion;  \n(iv) The cost to the parties of their representatives, attor-  \nneys, etc.;  \n(v) Salaries in other sports or occupations.  \n(c) Admissible Statistics. Only publicly available statistics  \nshall be admissible. For purposes of this provision, publicly  \navailable statistics shall include data available through subscrip-  \ntion-only websites (e.g., Baseball Prospectus). Statistics and data  \ngenerated through the use of performance technology, wearable  \ntechnology, or \u201cSTATCAST\u201d, whether publicly available or not,  \nshall not be admissible.  \n22  \n(11) Confidential Major League Salary Data. For its confiden-  \ntial use, as background information, the arbitration panel will be  \ngiven a tabulation showing the minimum salary in the Major  \nLeagues and salaries for the preceding season of all players on  \nMajor League rosters as of August 31, broken down by years of  \nMajor League service. The names and Clubs of the Players con-  \ncerned will appear on the tabulation. In utilizing the salary tabula-  \ntion, the arbitration panel shall consider the salaries of all  \ncomparable Players and not merely the salary of a single Player or  \ngroup of Players.  \n(12) Prohibition Regarding Competitive Balance Tax. No par-  \nticipant in a salary arbitration shall refer in any fashion, either orally  \nor in writing, to any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive  \nBalance Tax). No salary arbitration panel shall consider in any fash-  \nion any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive Balance  \nTax).  \n(13) Timetable and Decision. Arbitration hearings shall be  \nscheduled to be held from February 1 to February 20 absent a con-  \ntrary agreement of the Parties. The arbitration panel may render the  \ndecision on the day of the hearing, and shall make every effort to  \ndo so not later than 24 hours following the close of the hearing. The  \narbitration panel shall be limited to awarding only one or the other  \nof the two figures submitted. There shall be no opinion. There shall  \nbe no release of the arbitration award by the arbitration panel  \nexcept to the Club, the Player, the Association and the LRD. The  \npanel chair shall initially inform the Association and the LRD of  \nthe award only and not how the panel members voted. The panel  \nchair shall disclose to the Association and the LRD the individual  \nvotes of the panel members on each March 15 following the Feb-  \nruary hearings. The panel chair shall insert the figure awarded in  \nparagraph 2 of the executed Uniform Player\u2019s Contract delivered at  \nthe hearing and shall forward the Contract to the Office of the  \nCommissioner.  \n23  \nARTICLE VII\u2014Expenses and Expense Allowances  \nA.

A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in  \nwriting by the Grievant or by the Association to a designated represen-  \ntative of the LRD within 15 days following receipt of the Club\u2019s writ-  \nten decision. Grievances which involve (a) more than one Club, or (b)  \na Player who is not under contract to a Club that is party to the Griev-  \nance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the  \nGrievance shall be presented to the designated representative of the  \nLRD within (a) 30 days from the date of the occurrence upon which  \nthe Grievance is based, or (b) 30 days from the date on which the facts  \nof the matter became known or reasonably should have become known  \nto the Player, whichever is later. A Grievance appealed to or filed at  \nStep 2 shall be discussed within 35 days thereafter (within 2 days if  \ndisciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and  \nhealth) between representatives of the LRD and representatives of the  \n45  \nAssociation in an attempt to settle it. If both Parties agree, the Player  \nand Club principals will also participate in the Step 2 meeting. The  \nParties will attempt to exchange documents in advance of the Step 2  \nmeeting but the meeting shall occur within 35 days even if documents  \nhave not been exchanged by that date. Within 10 days following such  \nmeeting (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance  \ninvolving Player safety and health), the designated representative of  \nthe LRD shall advise the Grievant in writing of his decision and shall  \nfurnish a copy to the Association. If the decision of the LRD represen-  \ntative is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Griev-  \nance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall  \nnot be eligible for further appeal.  \nArbitration. Within 15 days following receipt of the Step 2 decision,  \nthe Grievant or the Association may appeal the Grievance in writing to  \nthe Panel Chair for impartial arbitration. The Panel Chair shall set a  \ntime, date and place for hearing the appeal. The Panel Chair shall  \nattempt to open the hearing within one-year from the filing of the  \nGrievance (within 5 days of receipt of the notice of appeal if a disci-  \nplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health).  \nIf the Panel Chair cannot do so given previously scheduled hearings,  \nthe Panel Chair shall direct that the Grievance be assigned to an Alter-  \nnate Panel Chair, unless one of the Parties objects. In response to an  \nobjection, the Panel Chair shall select Grievance(s) to be assigned to  \nparticular Alternate Panel Chair(s) so that hearings for all Grievances  \nwill open within one year of filing. A case heard by an Alternate Panel  \nChair shall be conducted by a tripartite panel if either Party elects in  \nadvance of the opening of the hearing.  \nAll hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Pro-  \ncedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Arbitration Panel shall ren-  \nder a written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion  \nof such hearing (within 5 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance  \ninvolving Player safety and health), and may affirm, modify or reverse  \nthe decision from which the appeal is taken. The decision of the Arbi-  \ntration Panel shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the  \nGrievance appealed to it. A decision of an Alternate Panel Chair shall  \nnot constitute precedent of the Arbitration Panel, but shall have the  \nsame precedential effect as an arbitration decision rendered outside of  \nthis collective bargaining relationship.  \n46  \nWith regard to the arbitration of Grievances, the Arbitration Panel shall  \nhave jurisdiction and authority only to determine the existence of or  \ncompliance with, or to interpret or apply agreements or provisions of  \nagreements between the Association and the Clubs or any of them, or  \nbetween individual Players and Clubs. The Arbitration Panel shall not  \nhave jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from, or alter in any  \nway the provisions of such agreements. All costs of arbitration, includ-  \ning the fees and expenses of the impartial arbitrator, shall be borne  \nequally by the Parties, provided that each of the Parties shall bear the  \ncost of its own party arbitrator, witnesses, counsel and the like.  \nC. Special Procedure with Regard to Certain  \nDisciplinary Action  \nExcept as set forth in Article XII(E)(3)(c), complaints involving a fine  \nor suspension imposed upon a Player by the Chief Baseball Officer or  \nthe Commissioner for conduct on the playing field or in the ballpark  \nshall be subject exclusively to this Section C as follows:  \n(1) Fines Exceeding $1,000 and Suspensions  \n(a) The Office of the Commissioner will provide the Players  \nAssociation with any applicable Umpire\u2019s Incident Report con-  \ntemporaneously with the Notice of Discipline. Except as set forth  \nin Section C(2) below (with respect to fines of $1,000 or less and  \nno suspension), any Player who believes that he has a justifiable  \ncomplaint regarding such discipline may, within 7 days of his  \nreceipt of written notification of the discipline, appeal in writing  \nto the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, if the discipline was  \nimposed by the Chief Baseball Officer, or to the Commissioner,  \nif the discipline was imposed by him, for a hearing.  \n(b) Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Special Assistant  \nto the Commissioner or the Commissioner, as the case may be,  \nshall designate a time and place for hearing the appeal, which  \nhearing shall be commenced within 10 days from the date of  \nreceipt of the appeal. Unless the appeal involves an incident in  \nwhich three or more players were suspended, all appeal hearings  \nshall be held by videoconference, except that the Player may  \nelect an in-person hearing in the following circumstances: (1) the  \nPlayer is available for a hearing in New York during the 10-day  \nperiod; or (11) the Player is suspended in excess of five games  \n47  \n(for a starting pitcher) or in excess of three games (for a position  \nplayer or relief pitcher), in which case an in-person hearing shall  \nbe scheduled at a mutually agreeable location within the 10-day  \nperiod.  \n(c) Discipline for Post-season Conduct. Notwithstanding  \nparagraph (b) above, a hearing involving a suspension for con-  \nduct on the playing field or in the ballpark during the post-season  \nshall be heard within forty-eight (48) hours of the receipt of the  \nappeal. The Chief Baseball Officer, or the Commissioner, as the  \ncase may be, shall determine the timing of the suspension, sub-  \nject to the Player\u2019s right to appeal and without prejudice to the  \nPlayers Association\u2019s position regarding past practice of the tim-  \ning of such suspensions.  \n(d) Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules  \nof Procedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Special Assis-  \ntant to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner, as the case may  \nbe, shall render a written decision as soon as practicable follow-  \ning the conclusion of such hearing, and may affirm, modify, or  \nrevoke the disciplinary action originally imposed. The decision  \nby the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, or the Commis-  \nsioner, as the case may be, shall constitute full, final and com-  \nplete disposition of the complaint and shall have the same effect  \nas a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel.  \n(2) Fines of $1,000 or Less and No Suspension. If the discipline  \ninvolves a fine in the amount of $1,000 or less and no suspension, a  \nPlayer may, within 7 days of his receipt of written notification of the  \ndiscipline, appeal his discipline in writing to the Chief Baseball  \nOfficer. Such appeals shall be conducted through an informal tele-  \nphone conference at a mutually agreeable time and date.  \n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section C(1) above, if any  \nsuch discipline imposed upon a Player by the Chief Baseball Offi-  \ncer involves a fine in an amount which exceeds $15,000 or a sus-  \npension exceeding 10 games, any complaint relating thereto shall be  \nappealable, from the decision of the Special Assistant to the Com-  \nmissioner to the Commissioner for determination in the same man-  \nner and with the same effect as provided in paragraph 1(b) of  \nSection A hereof.  \n48  \n(4) All settlements of discipline issued to a Player for conduct on  \nthe playing field or in the ballpark shall be non-precedential; pro-  \nvided, however, that the Office of the Commissioner may consider  \na Player\u2019s prior discipline for on-field conduct when determining  \nthe appropriate level of discipline for another infraction, irrespec-  \ntive of whether the prior discipline was subject to a settlement  \nagreement.  \nD. Grievances Initiated or Appealed by a Club  \nStep 1. Any Club which believes it has a justifiable Grievance shall  \npresent a written notice of the Grievance to the Player with a copy to  \nthe Association; provided, however, that for a Grievance to be consid-  \nered beyond Step 1, such written notice shall be presented within (a)  \n45 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is  \nbased, or (b) 45 days from the date on which the facts of the matter  \nbecame known or reasonably should have become known to the Club,  \nwhichever is later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written  \nnotice, the Player shall advise the Club in writing of his decision and  \nshall furnish a copy to the LRD. If the decision of the Player is not  \nappealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be  \nconsidered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligi-  \nble for further appeal.  \nStep 2. A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in  \nwriting by the Club or the LRD to the Association within 15 days fol-  \nlowing receipt of the Player\u2019s written decision. Grievances which  \ninvolve (a) more than one Club, (b) more than one Player, or (c) a  \nPlayer who is not under contract to a Club which is party to the Griev-  \nance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the  \nGrievance shall be presented to the Association within (a) 30 days  \nfrom the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or  \n(b) 30 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became  \nknown or reasonably should have become known to the Club,  \nwhichever is later. A Grievance appealed to or filed at Step 2 shall be  \ndiscussed within 35 days thereafter between representatives of the  \nLRD and representatives of the Association in an attempt to settle it. If  \nboth Parties agree, the Player and Club principals will also participate  \nin the Step 2 meeting. The Parties will attempt to exchange documents  \nin advance of the Step 2 meeting, but the meeting shall occur within 35  \n49  \ndays even if documents have not been exchanged by that date. Within  \n10 days following such meeting, the Association shall advise the LRD  \nin writing of its decision. If the decision of the Association is not  \nappealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be  \nconsidered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligi-  \nble for further appeal.  \nArbitration. Within 15 days following receipt of the Step 2 decision  \nof the Association, the LRD may appeal the Grievance in writing to the  \nPanel Chair for impartial arbitration. The procedures to be followed in  \narbitration and the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Panel shall be as set  \nforth in Section B above.  \nNothing contained in this Section D shall be deemed to limit or impair  \nthe right of any Club to impose discipline upon a Player or Players or  \nto take any other action not inconsistent with the Uniform Player\u2019s Con-  \ntract or any agreement with the Association to which the Club is a Party.  \nAny complaint or dispute which may be a subject for discipline shall  \nnot constitute a proper basis for a Club Grievance under this Section D.  \nE. Grievances Initiated or Appealed by the Association  \n(1) The Association may on its own motion appeal Grievances or  \ncomplaints on behalf of a Player or Players as provided in this  \nGrievance Procedure, except that the Association will not appeal a  \nGrievance or complaint involving player discipline without the  \napproval of the Player or Players concerned.  \n(2) The Association may on its own motion initiate Grievances  \nor complaints on behalf of a Player or Players on all matters not  \ninvolving player discipline. Nothing herein shall interfere with the  \nright of a Player who initiates a disciplinary Grievance or complaint  \nto be represented by the Association at any Step of the Grievance  \nProcedure.  \nF. Miscellaneous  \n(1) Each of the time limits set forth herein may be extended by  \nmutual agreement of the parties involved.  \n(2) If any Grievance is not processed in accordance with the pre-  \nscribed time limits in any Step, unless an extension of time has been  \n50  \nmutually agreed upon, either party, after notifying the other party of  \nits intent in writing, may appeal to the next Step.  \n(3) Any decision which is appealable under this Grievance Pro-  \ncedure but which is not appealed within the time allowed or within  \nany time mutually agreed upon by the Parties shall constitute a full,  \nfinal and complete disposition of the Grievance involved.  \n(4) In any discussion or hearing provided for in the Grievance  \nProcedure, a Player may be accompanied by a representative of the  \nAssociation who may participate in such discussion or hearing and  \nrepresent the Player. In any such discussion or hearing, any other  \nparty may be accompanied by a representative who may participate  \nin such discussion or hearing and represent such party.  \nG. Survival Following Termination of Basic Agreement  \nUnless eliminated or modified following an impasse in bargaining,  \nArticle XI shall remain in full force and effect after termination of this  \nAgreement; provided, however, that disputes arising after the termina-  \ntion of this Agreement related to the legality or validity of unilateral  \nchanges of terms and conditions of employment following an impasse  \nin bargaining and any other self-help conduct of the Parties, including  \nbut not limited to, unilateral changes in nonmandatory subjects of bar-  \ngaining, shall not be subject to Article XI.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XIIJ\u2014Discipline  \nA. Just Cause  \n", "The Parties recognize that a Player may be subjected to disciplinary  \naction for just cause by his Club, the Chief Baseball Officer or the  \nCommissioner. Therefore, in Grievances regarding discipline, the issue  \nto be resolved shall be whether there has been just cause for the penalty  \nimposed.  \nIf discipline imposed upon a Player is determined to be improper by  \nreason of a final decision under this Grievance Procedure, the Player  \nshall promptly be made whole.  \nThe term \u201cmake whole\u201d means:  \n(1) if a fine is found to have been imposed improperly, the fine  \nwill be promptly repaid;  \n51  \n(2) any salary loss as a result of an improper suspension will be  \npromptly paid;  \n(3) in the application of items (1) and (2) above, interest will also  \nbe paid at the rate per annum set forth in Article XV(K) below; and  \n(4) crediting the Player with performance statistics for the pur-  \npose of determining whether a performance level contained in any  \nspecial covenant to his Uniform Player\u2019s Contract has been met.  \nSuch credit shall be determined by multiplying the Player\u2019s relevant  \naverage per game statistic while he was on a Club\u2019s Active List for  \nthe current championship season by the number of games for which  \nthe Arbitration Panel determines the Player was improperly sus-  \npended and adding that product to the Player\u2019s year-end total. Such  \ncredit shall not be awarded to a Player for such time that his suspen-  \nsion covers time the Player is on the Disabled List.  \nB. Conduct Detrimental or Prejudicial to Baseball  \nPlayers may be disciplined for just cause for conduct that is materially  \ndetrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of Baseball  \nincluding, but not limited to, engaging in conduct in violation of fed-  \neral, state or local law. The Commissioner and a Club shall not disci-  \npline a Player for the same act or conduct under this provision. In cases  \nof this type, a Club may only discipline a Player, or take other adverse  \naction against him, when the Commissioner defers the disciplinary  \ndecision to the Club.  \nC. Notice  \nWritten notice of discipline of a Player (a fine, or suspension, or both)  \nimposed by the Commissioner of Baseball, the Chief Baseball Officer,  \nor a Club (except for actions arising from participation in the Winter  \nLeagues) and the reason therefore shall in every case be given to the  \nPlayer and the Association.  \nWith respect to discipline imposed upon a Player by the Chief Base-  \nball Officer or the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall immedi-  \nately give to the Association notice by e-mail of fines, suspensions  \nand appeals for hearings.  \n52  \nD. Investigations and Discovery  \nUpon receiving notice from the Office of the Commissioner that it is  \nconducting an investigation of a Player (or Players) that may result in  \ndiscipline, the Player and the Association shall provide reasonable  \ncooperation with the investigation, including but not limited to produc-  \ning documents and information. However, the Player and the Associa-  \ntion reserve all of their rights to assert that any investigatory request  \nfrom the Office of the Commissioner does not require cooperation  \nbecause the request is unreasonable, irrelevant, overbroad, or ambigu-  \nous, or the requested information is covered by a recognized privilege.  \nDisputes regarding whether a Player or the Association has provided  \nreasonable cooperation in a particular context shall be resolved by the  \nArbitration Panel on an expedited basis.  \nThe Office of the Commissioner may conduct investigatory interviews  \nof Players. Except where circumstances require expeditious handling,  \nthe Player and the Association shall receive reasonable advance notice  \nof any investigatory interview with a Player. Where circumstances  \nrequiring expeditious handling are present, the Player and the Associ-  \nation shall as much advance notice as is possible, but in no  \nevent shall the Association receive less notice than the Player. All par-  \nties recognize the right of the Player to be represented at such inter-  \nview by the Association and counsel of his choice.  \nAt the conclusion of the Office of the Commissioner\u2019s investigation,  \nbut prior to the imposition of any discipline, the Parties shall conduct  \na pre-discipline conference. The Parties\u2019 discussion at this conference  \nshall be considered confidential and inadmissible in any Grievance  \nchallenging the discipline that may be imposed on the Player. At or  \nbefore this pre-discipline conference, the Office of the Commissioner  \nshall describe the results of its investigation and the evidence support-  \ning discipline.  \nA Player who is disciplined shall have the right to discover, in timely  \nfashion, all documents and evidence adduced during any investigation  \nof the charges involved, including but not limited to any documents or  \nevidence in the possession of the Office of the Commissioner that tend  \nto negate a Player\u2019s guilt, to mitigate punishment, or to impeach any  \nwitness who will appear at any hearing challenging discipline.  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this Section D is not intended to super-  \nsede or alter in any way the Parties\u2019 respective rights and positions  \n53  \nwith respect to the meaning and application of Article XII(A) and (B)  \nor Panel Decision No. 41 (Ferguson Jenkins).  \nE. Compliance  \n(1) Nothing contained in the Grievance Procedure shall excuse a  \nPlayer from prompt compliance with any discipline imposed upon  \nhim.  \n(2) Club Fines. A fine imposed by a Club pursuant to Regula-  \ntion 5 of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract in excess of $10,000 may  \nnot be deducted from the Player\u2019s salary until such fine is finally  \nupheld in the Grievance Procedure or the time in which to file a  \nGrievance has expired.  \n(3) Discipline Imposed by the Chief Baseball Officer or Com-  \nmissioner.  \n(a) A fine imposed by the Chief Baseball Officer or the Com-  \nmissioner in excess of $10,000 may not be deducted from the  \nPlayer\u2019s salary until such fine is finally upheld in the Grievance  \nProcedure or the time in which to file a Grievance has expired.  \n(b) The Player\u2019s employing Club is authorized, at the request  \nof the Chief Baseball Officer, or the Commissioner in the case of  \na fine imposed by the Commissioner, to deduct the amount of the  \nfine from the Player\u2019s salary and transmit such sum to the Com-  \nmissioner once the fine may be deducted from the Player\u2019s salary.  \n(c) The Chief Baseball Officer may choose to suspend a Player  \nwithout pay for: (1) intentionally throwing a baseball, equipment  \nor other object at a non-uniformed personnel with the intent of  \ncausing bodily harm; (11) physically assaulting a fan or member  \nof the media; (111) physically assaulting an umpire in a manner  \nthat endangers his health or safety; and (iv) making public state-  \nments that question the integrity of the game, the umpires, the  \nCommissioner and/or other Commissioner\u2019s Office personnel.  \nSuspensions without pay for such conduct shall be appealable  \nthrough the procedures of Article XI(B) in an expedited manner,  \nand the suspensions shall be stayed pending the completion of  \nthose procedures.  \n54  \nF. Major League Rules 15 and 16  \nThe following time limit provisions set forth in Major League Rules 15  \nand 16 shall be inapplicable in disciplinary matters:  \n(1) the prohibition in Rule 16(a) against reinstatement of a  \nPlayer on the Restricted, Disqualified and Ineligible Lists in the  \nperiod August | to October 31, inclusive;  \n(2) the prohibition in Rules 15(c)(1) and 16(c) against applica-  \ntion for reinstatement from the Ineligible List until after the lapse of  \none year from the date of placement on such list; and  \n(3) the requirement of Rule 16(a) that the Player\u2019s Club shall be  \nentitled to 30 days\u2019 written notice prior to his reinstatement from the  \nDisqualified or Ineligible Lists, if application for such reinstatement  \nis filed after February 1 of any year.  \nARTICLE XIII\u2014Safety and Health  \nA. Safety and Health Advisory Committee  \n(1) Safety and Health Advisory Committee  \nThe Parties shall establish and maintain a bipartisan Safety and  \nHealth Advisory Committee which shall be comprised of an equal  \nnumber of members representing the Association and representing  \nthe Clubs. The purpose of the Committee shall be  \n(a) to deal with emergency safety and health problems as they  \narise, and attempt to find solutions, and  \n(b) to engage in review of, planning for and maintenance of  \nsafe and healthful working conditions for Players.  \n(2) Committee Meetings  \nA meeting of the Safety and Health Advisory Committee may be  \ncalled by any member thereof who believes that an emergency  \nsafety and health problem exists and requires immediate attention,  \nand a meeting shall be held as soon as practicable thereafter. In addi-  \ntion, the Committee shall hold at least one regular meeting annually  \nfor purposes of review and planning.  \n55  \n(3) Power and Authority of Committee  \nThe Safety and Health Advisory Committee shall make recom-  \nmendations to the Parties as to the solution of problems and the  \nestablishment of policies. The Committee shall use its best efforts to  \npersuade the Parties to adopt the Committee\u2019s recommendations.  \nThe Committee, however, shall only have advisory authority and it  \nshall not have the power to impose its views or recommendations  \nupon the Parties.  \n(4) Other Rights and Remedies  \nThe Players Association may file and pursue through arbitration  \na grievance concerning safety and health. The Parties will attempt to  \navoid grievances on this subject by making every reasonable effort  \nto utilize the Safety and Health Advisory Committee. However, it is  \nnot a necessary prerequisite to utilization of the Grievance Proce-  \ndure that the Safety and Health Advisory Committee procedures be  \ninstituted or exhausted. Nothing herein shall diminish or interfere  \nwith any other rights and remedies the Players or the Association  \nmay pursue under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement or  \nunder the procedures established pursuant to the Occupational Safety  \nand Health Act.  \nB. Safety Complaints\u2014Responsibility of the Commissioner  \nNotwithstanding the provisions of Section A, when a safety complaint  \nis made by the Association to the Office of the Commissioner, the  \nCommissioner shall promptly designate a representative to investigate  \nand to attempt to resolve the problem. The Commissioner shall  \npromptly notify the Association of the results of the investigation and  \nof all attempts to resolve the problem.  \nC. Disabled List  \nApplication by a Club to the Commissioner to place a Player on the  \nDisabled List shall be accompanied by a Standard Form of Diagnosis  \n(see Attachment 5), a copy of which shall be provided to the Player and  \nthe Association. The Standard Form of Diagnosis shall be completed  \nby the Club Physician and shall include, as a separate item, an estt-  \nmated time period for recovery. The Club Physician will also complete  \n56  \nand submit the Standard Form of Diagnosis for recertification of a  \nPlayer on the Disabled List at the date when he first becomes eligible  \nfor reinstatement to active status and then every ten days following the  \ndate upon which the Player first became eligible for reinstatement  \n(except for Players placed on the 60-day Disabled List). In addition  \nto the Standard Form of Diagnosis, the Office of the Commissioner  \nmay request that a Club provide additional information in support of a  \nDisabled List placement before the application is approved by the  \nCommissioner. The Club shall provide a copy of such additional infor-  \nmation to the Association.  \nA Club requesting the placement of a Player on the Disabled List for a  \nconcussion shall submit, in lieu of a Standard Form of Diagnosis, a  \nConcussion-Specific Diagnostic Form (see Attachment 36), a copy  \nof which shall be provided to the Player and the Association. The  \nConcussion-Specific Diagnostic Form shall be completed by the Club  \nPhysician and Certified Athletic Trainer and shall include the specified  \nsupporting documentation. The Club Physician also must complete  \nand submit the Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form for recertifica-  \ntion of a Player on the Disabled List for a concussion at the date when  \nhe first becomes eligible for reinstatement to active status and then  \nevery ten days following the date upon which the Player first became  \neligible for reinstatement (except for Players placed on the 60-day Dis-  \nabled List for a concussion). Prior to the time that a Player on the Dis-  \nabled List for a concussion is permitted to play in any game, the Club  \nmust submit a Return to Play form and supporting information to the  \nMedical Director of the Office of the Commissioner (see Attachment  \n36), a copy of which shall be provided to the Player and the Associa-  \ntion. The Player\u2019s return must be approved prior to the time that he will  \nbe removed from the Disabled List. See Attachment 36.  \nD. Second Medical Opinion  \nWithin 20 days following the execution of this Agreement, the Clubs  \nshall provide an updated, accepted listing of medical specialists, by  \nspecialty and by geographic region, to whom Players may upon their  \nrequest go for diagnosis and a second medical evaluation of an  \nemployment-related illness or injury being treated by the Club Physi-  \ncian. At least two board-certified physicians shall be designated for  \neach specialty in each of the geographic regions, and all the physicians  \n57  \non the list shall be board-certified in an appropriate medical specialty.  \nThe Commissioner\u2019s Medical Advisory Committee, in consultation  \nwith a medical professional designated by the Association, shall  \nreview and update the list of specialists on an annual basis. The Asso-  \nciation shall have 30 days from the date of receiving an updated list  \nwithin which to recommend additions to or deletions from the list.  \nPrior to undergoing a \u201csecond evaluation,\u201d a Player shall inform the Club  \nin writing of his decision to seek a second medical opinion, and the name  \nof the physician who will be performing the diagnosis and medical  \nevaluation. A Player may seek a \u201csecond evaluation\u201d from a medical  \nspecialist on the accepted listing who is located outside of the geographic  \nregion within which the Player\u2019s Club 1s located, provided that the Player  \nis not absent from the Club for an unreasonable period of time.  \nIf a Player uses the services of a medical specialist who is on the  \naccepted listing, the Club shall pay the cost of the \u201csecond evaluation,\u201d  \nincluding transportation and hotel costs.  \nExpenses for \u201csecond evaluations\u201d by medical specialists who are not  \non the accepted listing shall be authorized and paid only by prior writ-  \nten agreement between the Player and the Club.  \nSee Attachment 35.  \nE. Certified Athletic Trainers  \nEach Club shall employ two Certified Athletic Trainers on a full-time  \nbasis. Both trainers will travel with the Club on the road; provided,  \nthat one trainer may remain in the Club\u2019s home city if necessary for  \nthe Club to fulfill its obligations to disabled players who do not travel  \nwith the Club.  \nIndividuals newly appointed as trainers shall be certified by the  \nNational Athletic Trainers Association (NATA) or the Canadian Ath-  \nletic Therapists Association (CATA), or shall be physical therapists  \nlicensed by an appropriate state authority.  \nF. Locker Room Equipment  \nEach visiting locker room shall be equipped with the following equip-  \nment, all in good working order, and of a size and capacity adequate  \nfor the treatment of professional baseball players: whirlpool, hydrocu-  \nlator, ultrasound machine and examining table.  \n58  \nG.

Active Player Limit  \n(1) Except as set forth in Major League Rule 2(c), the active  \nPlayer limit for the period beginning with Opening Day of the  \nchampionship season and ending at Midnight, August 31, shall be  \n25, provided that the minimum number of active Players maintained  \nby each Club throughout the championship season shall be 24.  \nHowever, if a reduction below 24 occurs as a result of unforeseen  \ncircumstances, the Club shall, within 48 hours (plus time necessary  \nfor the Player to report), bring its active roster back to a minimum  \nof 24 Players. The utilization or non-utilization of rights under this  \nparagraph (1) is an individual matter to be determined solely by  \neach Club for its own benefit. Clubs shall not act in concert with  \nother Clubs.  \n(2) The active Player limit set forth in Major League Rule 2(c)  \nfor the period beginning with September | and ending with the close  \nof the championship season shall be 40 for the duration of this  \nAgreement.  \n(3) Prohibition on Taxi Squads  \n(a) A Player who is directed to report to the Major League  \nClub during the championship season in connection with his  \npotential selection or recall to the Major League Active Roster  \nmust report to the Club upon his arrival in the Club\u2019s city (or the  \ncity of the Club\u2019s opponent); provided, however, that a Player  \nmay be directed by a Club to report on the day following his day  \nof arrival if: (1) the Player arrives in the Club\u2019s city (or the city of  \nthe Club\u2019s opponent) after the time by which the Club\u2019s Players  \nare required to arrive for a workout or pre-game activities; or (11)  \nthere is no game or workout scheduled for the day the Player  \narrives. For purposes of this subparagraph, all Players will be  \ndeemed to have reported to the Club no later than the day after  \n67  \nthe Player arrives in the Club\u2019s city (or the city of the Club\u2019s  \nopponent).  \n(b) A Player who reports to the Major League Club during the  \nchampionship season in connection with his potential selection or  \nrecall to the Major League Active Roster cannot remain with the  \nMajor League Club unless he is added to the Major League  \nActive Roster by the earlier of 8:00 P.M.

When a Club directs a Player to report to the  \nMajor Leagues and then returns the Player to the Minor League  \nclub without selecting or adding him to the Active Roster, the  \nreturn must be justified based on a change in the circumstances  \nthat led the Club to anticipate the Player\u2019s selection or recall.  \n(c) During the period between reporting to the Club and being  \nadded to the Active Roster, a Player may participate in one work-  \nout and/or orientation without receiving Major League salary or  \nservice, but may not be in uniform for a game or otherwise  \noccupy the bullpen, dugout, or field after the official end of his  \nClub\u2019s batting practice.  \n(d) A Player shall receive the applicable in-season meal and  \ntip allowance under Article VII(B), regardless of whether the  \nClub is at home or on the road, for the day he reports to the Club  \npursuant to subparagraph 3(a) above. For Players who are added  \nto the Active Roster, the in-season supplemental allowances pro-  \nvided for by Article VII(E) (to the extent applicable) shall com-  \nmence on the day that they are added to the Active Roster. A  \nPlayer who is returned to the Minor Leagues on the day after  \nreporting (pursuant to subparagraph 3(b) above) shall be entitled  \nto the Article VII(B)(1) allowance on the day of his return only if  \nhe joins his Minor League club after the start of the Minor  \nLeague club\u2019s game (or he arrives after 6:00 P.M. if no Minor  \nLeague game is scheduled).  \n(ec) A Player assigned from a Major League Club to a Minor  \nLeague club may not remain with the Major League Club for  \n68  \nmore than 24 hours.

Deferred compensation obligations incurred in a Contract  \nexecuted on or after September 30, 2002 must be fully funded by the  \n81  \nClub, in an amount equal to the present value of the total deferred com-  \npensation obligation, on or before the second July 1 following the  \nchampionship season in which the deferred compensation is earned.  \nFor purposes of this Article XVI, full funding of the present value of  \ndeferred compensation obligations shall mean that the Club must have  \nfunded, for the duration of and without interruption in each year, the  \ncurrent present value of the then outstanding deferred payments, dis-  \ncounted by 5% annually. If the prime interest rate in effect at The J.P.  \nMorgan Chase Bank on the immediately preceding November | is 7%  \nor higher, the Parties shall meet and confer regarding this Article XVI  \ndiscount rate and may, with due notice to the Clubs, amend such dis-  \ncount rate effective the next succeeding July 1.  \nNotwithstanding the above funding requirement, each Club shall be  \nentitled to an annual deductible amount of deferred compensation  \nwhich need not be funded for Contracts executed before December 11,  \n2011. Such deductible amount shall be applied to the aggregate of Uni-  \nform Player\u2019s Contracts executed during a given Basic Agreement  \nperiod before December 11, 2011, and shall be in an amount equal to  \nthe lesser of $2,000,000 or the present value of the total deferred com-  \npensation obligations owed by a Club pursuant to Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContracts executed during a given Basic Agreement period before  \nDecember 11, 2011. The deductible amount applicable to Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contracts signed during a given Basic Agreement period  \nbefore December 11, 2011 is applied against the Club\u2019s current aggre-  \ngate deferred compensation funding obligations from Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contracts signed during that Basic Agreement period and not  \nany particular Uniform Player\u2019s Contract(s).  \nUnless the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract provides otherwise, a Club may  \nfund deferred compensation obligations in such manner as it elects,  \nprovided that: (a) the funding method used by the Club must be such  \nthat the amount(s) funded are exclusively for the uses and purposes of  \nsatisfying the deferred compensation obligation(s) being funded; (b)  \nthe amount(s) funded are maintained in the form of unencumbered  \nassets comprising cash or cash equivalents and/or registered and unre-  \nstricted readily marketable securities, unless a Club obtains the Parties\u2019  \nprior written authorization of an alternative form; and (c) such  \namount(s) funded are subject to the claims of the Club\u2019s general cred-  \nitors. Each Club shall certify quarterly to the Office of the Commis-  \n82  \nsioner by January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year  \n(and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide such certifications  \nto the Association within 30 days of their receipt) the manner in which  \nits deferred compensation obligations that were required to be funded  \nby the immediately preceding July 1 have been funded. In addition,  \nupon each quarterly certification, each Club shall provide to the Office  \nof the Commissioner all records relating to its deferred compensation  \nfunding arrangements, and the Office of the Commissioner shall sup-  \nply any such records to the Association upon request.  \nARTICLE XVII\u2014Existing Agreements  \nThe Parties recognize that there are existing agreements between a  \nMajor League Club or Clubs and the Players or the Association, and  \nbetween either of the Major Leagues separately and the Players or the  \nAssociation. The Parties reaffirm such agreements and incorporate  \nthem as part of this Agreement insofar as they are not inconsistent with  \nthis Agreement. Such agreements shall be considered agreements  \nbetween the Association and the Clubs or any of them for the purpose  \nof the Grievance Procedure provided for in Article XI hereof.  \nThe following three agreements between the Clubs and the Association  \nshall not be incorporated as part of this Agreement and shall not be  \naffected by the adoption of this Agreement:  \n(a) The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan;  \n(b) The Agreement re Major League Baseball Players Benefit  \nPlan; and  \n(c) The Agreement Regarding Dues Check-off.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XVIITI\u2014Rule Changes  \n", "If during the term of this Agreement any Major League Rule, or other  \nrule or regulation is proposed to be changed, the Clubs agree that they  \nshall give the Association notice thereof, and shall negotiate the pro-  \nposed change with the Association, provided that the obligation to  \nnegotiate with the Association provided by this Article XVHI shall  \napply only to (a) a change in a Player benefit under an existing rule or  \nregulation and (b) the adoption of a rule or regulation which would  \nchange a Player benefit under an existing rule or regulation or impose  \n83  \nan obligation upon the Players which had not previously existed.  \nExcept as specifically provided in this Article XVIII, the right of the  \nClubs to make any rule change whatsoever shall not be impaired or  \nlimited in any way, provided that the Clubs shall not make any change  \nwhich is inconsistent with the provisions of any then existing agree-  \nment between the Clubs and the Association.  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if during the term of this  \nAgreement any playing or scoring rule is proposed to be changed, the  \nClubs agree that they shall give the Association notice thereof, and  \nshall negotiate the proposed change with the Association, provided that  \nthe obligation to negotiate with the Association shall apply only to  \nchanges which significantly affect terms and conditions of employ-  \nment. Such proposals to change playing or scoring rules shall normally  \nbe made only during the off-season. If the Clubs and the Association  \nfail to reach agreement on a proposed change which is subject to nego-  \ntiation, the proposed change shall not be put into effect until the com-  \npletion of the next complete succeeding season (including the Wild  \nCard Game, Division Series, League Championship Series and World  \nSeries) following the date the change was proposed.  \nARTICLE XIX\u2014Assignment of Player Contracts  \nA. Consent to Assignment  \n(1) The contract of a Player with ten or more years of Major  \nLeague service, the last five of which have been with one Club,  \nshall not be assignable to another Major League Club without the  \nPlayer\u2019s written consent. At his sole election, however, a Player  \nmay, at the time he signs a multi-year contract with a Club, waive  \nthe right to prevent an assignment of his contract under this Section  \nA(1), provided that the multi-year contract (a) is signed before the  \nPlayer has attained ten or more years of Major League service, the  \nlast five of which have been with one Club, and (b) contains a no  \ntrade provision that, at a minimum, limits the Club\u2019s right to assign  \nthe Player\u2019s contract, during each of its years, to no more than six-  \nteen (16) Clubs designated or subsequently to be designated by the  \nPlayer.  \n(2) (a) The contract of a Player with five or more years of Major  \nLeague service, not including service while on the Military List (or  \n84  \nseven or more years of Major League service, including service  \nwhile on the Military List), shall not be assigned otherwise than to  \nanother Major League Club, without the Player\u2019s written consent.  \n(b) Not earlier than 4 days prior to the contemplated date of  \nan assignment requiring the Player\u2019s consent under subparagraph  \n(a) above, or 8 days, if the Player has no options remaining or if  \nthe assignment is during the period from the close of the  \nchampionship season to the opening of Spring Training, the Club  \nshall give written notice to the Player, with a copy to the Associ-  \nation, which shall advise the Player that he may (1) consent to the  \nassignment, (11) refuse the assignment or (111) elect to become a  \nfree agent. Additionally, the notice shall advise that in the event  \nthat the Player consents to the assignment, he may elect free  \nagency between the end of the then current Major League season  \nand the next following October 15, unless he is returned to a  \nMajor League roster prior to making such election.  \nThe Player shall also be informed in the notice that, within 2  \ndays after the date of the notice, or 3 days, if during the period  \nfrom the close of the championship season to the opening of  \nSpring Training, he must advise the Club in writing as to his deci-  \nsion to consent to the assignment or to elect to become a free  \nagent. A failure on the part of the Player to respond to the notice  \nshall constitute a refusal of the assignment. No response from the  \nPlayer shall be considered effective until twenty-four hours from  \nhis receipt of the Club\u2019s notice; provided, however, if such elec-  \ntion would result in the forfeiture of termination pay, the election  \nshall not become effective unless and until the Association con-  \nfirms the election in writing.  \n(c) A Player who elects to become a free agent under this  \nparagraph (2), and whose free agency election is confirmed in  \nwriting by the Association, shall immediately be eligible to nego-  \ntiate and contract with any Club without any restrictions or qual-  \nifications and shall not be entitled to receive termination pay.  \nSuch a free agent shall receive transportation and travel expenses  \nin the same manner as he would if he had been unconditionally  \nreleased except that he shall be limited to receiving travel  \nexpenses to his new club if he reports to it directly, provided such  \nexpenses are less than to his home city.  \n85  \n(3) Any Player who has a right to refuse the assignment of his  \ncontract under paragraph 2(a) above may grant consent to an  \nassignment of his contract in advance of any specific contemplated  \nassignment if such consent (a) is granted not more than ten (10)  \ndays prior to the start of the championship season for which the  \nconsent is given, (b) 1s in writing, (c) designates the assignee Club  \nand (d) requires that the assignment take place within 45 days from  \nthe start of the championship season or the date on which the con-  \nsent is granted, whichever is later. The Club shall provide a copy of  \nthe Player\u2019s consent to the Association contemporaneously upon  \nthe Club\u2019s receipt of such consent. No Club shall attempt to secure,  \nby any Major League terms included in a Minor League Uniform  \nPlayer Contract, an advance consent to an assignment to a Minor  \nLeague club, and any consent so secured shall have no force  \nor effect.  \nB. Assignment to Minor League club  \nWhen a Player\u2019s contract is assigned from a Major League Club to a  \nMinor League club, the rights and benefits of such Player that do, and  \ndo not, follow him to the Minor Leagues shall be in accordance with  \npast practices. Additionally, such a Player shall retain the right, if any,  \nto become a free agent, or to require the assignment of his contract,  \nwhich he possessed under his then current Major League contract as  \nprovided in Article XX hereof, which right shall not be diminished or  \ninterfered with as a result of such assignment or the signing by the  \nPlayer of a Minor League contract, provided that such right shall ter-  \nminate if and when such Player signs a Minor League contract follow-  \ning the time when his free agency rights arise under Article XX.  \nC. Disabled List\u2014Assignment to Minor League club  \n(1) There shall be no assignment of a Player by a Major League  \nClub to a Minor League club while such Player is on a Major  \nLeague Disabled List.  \nPlayers may not be reinstated from the Disabled List for purposes  \nof assignment to a Minor League club until they are ready to play.  \nPlayers who are injured and not able to play may not be assigned to  \na Minor League club. However, if a Player who is on optional  \nassignment consistent with this provision is assigned to another  \n86  \nMajor League Club, he may be optioned immediately by the  \nassignee Club without violating this prohibition, regardless of  \nwhether the Player is injured and unable to play at the time of the  \nassignment.  \nGrievances alleging a violation of Article XIX(C)(1) that have  \nthe potential to affect a Player\u2019s status under Article VI(E), XX(B)  \nor XX(D) shall be submitted to arbitration prior to Grievances that  \ndo not affect the status of Players.  \n(2) Notwithstanding Section C(1) above, a Player who is injured  \nand not able to play may be assigned to a Minor League club:  \n(a) During the period immediately following the close of the  \nchampionship season and before the filing of Major League  \nReserve Lists under Major League Rule 2(a), if:  \n(1) the Player\u2019s Major League Uniform Player\u2019s Contract  \ndoes not cover the next succeeding season; and  \n(11) the Player, if he otherwise would have been eligible  \nfor salary arbitration as a \u201cSuper Two\u201d Player (see Article  \nVI(E)(1)(b)), may elect free agency under the procedures con-  \ntained in Article XX(D) in lieu of accepting the assignment;  \nprovided, however, that a Player who accepts the assignment  \nshall not have a right, by virtue of such acceptance, to elect free  \nagency following the next succeeding championship season.  \n(b) During the period immediately following the filing of  \nMajor League Reserve Lists and before the 15th day prior to the  \nstart of the next championship season, if:  \n(1) the Player has less than three years of Major League  \nService;  \n(11) the contemplated assignment would not be the Player\u2019s  \nsecond (or subsequent) career outright assignment since  \nMarch 19, 1990;  \n(111) the Player had no Major League service the prior  \nchampionship season; and  \n(iv) the Player was not selected by the assignor Major  \nLeague Club in the immediately preceding Rule 5 Draft.  \n87  \n(3) Rehabilitation Assignments  \n(a) Notwithstanding Section C(1) above, a Player on the Dis-  \nabled List may be assigned to a Minor League club for the pur-  \npose of rehabilitation with the Player\u2019s written consent, a copy of  \nwhich shall be forwarded to the Association, and with the  \napproval of the Commissioner. See Attachment 39.  \n(b) Separate consent shall be required for a rehabilitation  \nassignment for a new injury or a reoccurrence of an injury. In  \norder for a Player\u2019s written consent to be effective, the duration  \nof his rehabilitation assignment must be the product of good faith  \nnegotiation between the Player and Club. No consent shall be  \neffective for longer than twenty days (thirty days for pitchers).  \n(c) A Player on the Disabled List may be assigned to a Minor  \nLeague club for up to a maximum of twenty days (thirty days for  \npitchers) for each injury, or reoccurrence of an injury, for the pur-  \npose of rehabilitation. However, a Player may provide more than  \none consent for the same injury, or a reoccurrence of an injury, if  \nthe total number of days of the rehabilitation assignment for that  \ninjury or reoccurrence does not exceed a maximum of twenty  \ndays (thirty days for pitchers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  \nPlayer rehabbing from UCL reconstruction surgery may consent  \nto up to three consecutive ten-day extensions of his rehabilitation  \nassignment, with the approval of the Commissioner\u2019s Office and  \nthe Association.  \n(d) Any service with a Minor League club while on rehabili-  \ntation assignment shall be deemed to be Major League service as  \ndefined in Article XXI. A Player so assigned shall continue to  \nreceive his Major League salary and the other rights and benefits  \nof such Player shall be in accordance with past practices relating  \nto assignments to Minor League clubs; provided, however, that  \nall such players shall be treated as if they were Major League  \nPlayers on the road for purposes of hotel accommodations and  \nthe daily meal and tip allowance. Such assignment shall not be  \ncounted as an optional assignment under Major League Rule 11  \nor for any other purpose, and waivers shall not be required.  \n88  \nD. Foreign Assignments  \nExcept for the return of conditional assignments from outside the  \nUnited States and Canada, the contract of a Player shall not be assigned  \notherwise than within the United States and Canada, without the  \nPlayer\u2019s written consent.  \nE. Optional Assignments  \nIf a Player is optionally assigned for a total of less than 20 days in one  \nchampionship season, such optional assignment(s) shall not count as  \nan optional assignment in connection with the limitation upon optional  \nassignments provided for in Major League Rule I1(c). See Article  \nXXI(B).  \nFor purposes of counting days on option, the date of the optional  \nassignment shall be counted and the date of recall shall not be counted,  \nprovided that the date of the optional assignment shall not be counted  \nif the assignment takes place after the start of a Major League game in  \nwhich the Player otherwise would have been eligible to play, and the  \ndate of recall shall be counted if the recall takes place after the start of  \nany Minor League game in which the Player was eligible to play.  \nF. Waivers  \nAny assignment of a Player contract must conform to the rules regard-  \ning waivers contained in Major League Rule 10.  \nIn addition, each Friday, not later than 3 P.M. Eastern Time, the Office  \nof the Commissioner shall notify the Association of all waiver requests  \nand their disposition. Notification shall include:  \n(1) the date on which the waiver request was made;  \n(2) the date of expiration of the waiver period;  \n(3) if the waiver period has expired, whether or not claims were  \nfiled;  \n(4) if claims are not filed, the period for which waivers have  \nbeen granted; and  \n(5) if claims were filed, whether or not the Club requesting  \nwaivers has withdrawn its request. In the event claims were filed and  \n89  \nthe Club requesting waivers has withdrawn its request, the Office of  \nthe Commissioner need not identify the claiming Club or Clubs.  \nG. Designated Player  \nA Player who is in the status of a \u201cdesignated player\u201d under Major  \nLeague Rule 2(k) shall, during the period he is in such status, be  \n(1) paid at the rate of his Major League salary and  \n(2) credited with Major League service.  \nA Player who is in the status of a \u201cdesignated player\u201d under Major  \nLeague Rule 2(k) shall be unconditionally released or his contract  \nassigned within 7 days after he is placed in the status. A Club must  \nrequest the necessary waivers in a time frame that will allow it to  \nunconditionally release or assign the player within the 7-day period.  \nThe days between and including Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day  \nshall not count toward the 7-day limit.  \nH. Unconditional Release  \nNotwithstanding the provisions of Major League Rule 8 and paragraph  \n7(d) of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract, the following procedure may be  \nused to give notice to a Player in connection with his unconditional  \nrelease.  \nAt the same time the Club advises a Player in writing that the Club  \nhas requested waivers for the purpose of unconditional release, and  \nthe date on which the waiver request will expire, the Player shall  \nadvise the Club in writing of the address and telephone number to  \nwhich the Club should telephone or send written notice of termination  \nto the Player upon the expiration of the waiver period. If the Player  \nfails to supply a telephone number or address, the Club may use the  \nmost recent address or telephone number the Player has supplied the  \nClub.  \nUpon the expiration of the waiver period, the Club shall either give tele-  \nphone or written notice of termination to the Player. In addition, the  \nPlayer may call the Club to determine whether his contract has been  \nclaimed.  \n90  \nI. Forms  \nIn any case in which a Player\u2019s consent must be secured prior to the  \nassignment of his contract (see Article Article  \nArticle XIX(A)(3) and Article XIX(C)(3)) or in which a Player may  \nelect free agency in lieu of accepting the outright assignment of his  \ncontract (see Article XX(D)(1) and (2)), the form given to the Player  \nmust include the Player\u2019s name in typewritten form.  \nARTICLE XX\u2014Reserve System  \nA. Reservation Rights of Clubs  \nSubject to the rights of Players as set forth in this Agreement, each  \nClub may have title to and reserve up to 40 Player contracts. A Club  \nshall retain title to a contract and reservation rights until one of the fol-  \nlowing occurs:  \n(1) The Player becomes a free agent, as set forth in this Agree-  \nment;  \n(2) The Player becomes a free agent as a result of  \n(a) termination of the contract by the Club pursuant to para-  \ngraph 7(b) thereof,  \n(b) termination of the contract by the Player pursuant to para-  \ngraph 7(a) thereof,  \n(c) failure by the Office of the Commissioner to convey to the  \nPlayer, by Central Tender Letter submitted to the Association, the  \nClub\u2019s tender of a new contract within the time period specified  \nin paragraph 10(a) of the contract (see Attachment 9), or  \n(d) failure by the Club to exercise its right to renew the con-  \ntract within the time period specified in paragraph 10(a) thereof;  \nor  \n(3) The contract is assigned outright by the Club.  \nOn or before 8 P.M. Eastern Time on December 2 (or, if December 2  \nis a Saturday or Sunday, then on or before the preceding business day)  \nthe Office of the Commissioner shall satisfy the Clubs\u2019 tender obliga-  \ntions pursuant to paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract by  \n91  \nsubmitting to the Association a letter listing, by Club, the Players to  \nwhom each Club is tendering a contract for the term of the next year  \n(\u201cCentral Tender The Central Tender Letter shall, consistent  \nwith Article VI(A) and Article VI(B), include for each Player so ten-  \ndered the salary or salaries, performance bonuses and/or other terms,  \nif any, offered by the Club. The Central Tender Letter also shall sepa-  \nrately list, also by Club, those players who have not been tendered a  \ncontract for the term of the next year. The Office of the Commis-  \nsioner, at the time it transmits the Central Tender Letter, shall provide  \nto the Association addresses for all Players who had been promoted to  \nthe Major League roster for the first time in the preceding November  \nand for those Players who do not have a certified Player Agent. See  \nAttachment 9.  \nAny inadvertent error in the tendering or renewal of a contract, includ-  \ning but not limited to an untimely tender or renewal, shall result in free  \nagency under paragraph (2)(c) or (2)(d) above, whichever is applica-  \nble, only if the Player has first given the Club written notice that the  \ntendered or renewed Contract does not conform to the requirements of  \nArticle VI of this Agreement and the Club has not retendered or re-  \nexercised a renewal in conformance with all applicable rules within  \nseven (7) days after receipt by the Club of written notice of such  \ndefect.  \nA Club may also reserve, under separate headings on a Reserve List,  \nPlayers who properly have been placed on the Voluntarily Retired List,  \nthe Military List, the Suspended List, the Restricted List, the Disqual-  \nified List or the Ineligible List. See Attachments 10, 11 and 12.  \nB. Free Agency  \n(1) Eligibility  \nFollowing the completion of the term of his Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract, any Player with 6 or more years of Major League service  \nwho has not executed a contract for the next succeeding season shall  \nbecome a free agent, subject to and in accordance with the provi-  \nsions of this Section B.  \n(2) Procedure  \nThe procedure set forth in this paragraph (2) shall apply to Play-  \ners who become free agents pursuant to paragraph (1) above. Play-  \n92  \ners who otherwise become free agents under this Agreement shall be  \neligible to negotiate and contract with any Club without any restric-  \ntions or qualifications.  \n(a) A Player eligible to become a free agent under paragraph  \n(1) shall become a free agent as of 9 A.M. Eastern Time on the  \nday following the day that the last game of the World Series had  \nstarted.  \n(b) During the period beginning at the time when the Player  \nbecomes a free agent as defined in subparagraph (a) above and  \nending at 5 P.M. Eastern Time on the fifth day following the day  \nthat the last game of the World Series had started (\u201cQuiet  \nPeriod\u2019\u2019), any Club representative and any free agent or his repre-  \nsentative may talk with each other and discuss the merits of the  \nfree agent contracting, when eligible therefor, with the Club; pro-  \nvided, however, that the Club and the free agent shall not negoti-  \nate terms or contract with each other. The following subjects are  \namong those which may properly be discussed between any Club  \nand such Player:  \n(i) the Player\u2019s interest in playing for the Club, and the  \nClub\u2019s interest in having the Player play for it;  \n(11) the Club\u2019s plans about how it intends to utilize the  \nPlayer\u2019s services (as a starting pitcher or reliever, as a desig-  \nnated hitter or not, platooning, etc.);  \n(111) the advantages and disadvantages of playing for the  \nClub including the nature of the organization, the climate of  \nthe city, availability of suitable housing, etc.;  \n(iv) length of contract;  \n(v) guarantee provisions; and  \n(vi) no-trade or limited no-trade provisions.  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the free agent and his former  \nClub may engage in negotiations and enter into a contract during  \nthe Quiet Period.  \n(c) Players who become free agents pursuant to this Section B  \nshall, upon the expiration of the Quiet Period, be eligible to nego-  \n93  \ntiate and contract with any Club, subject to the provisions of this  \nSection B.  \n(3) Rights of Former Club  \nThe following provision shall apply only to each Player who  \nbecomes a free agent under this Section B after having been contin-  \nuously under reserve (without interruption) to the same Club (either  \nat the Major or Minor League level) since Opening Day of the  \nrecently completed championship season and who has never previ-  \nously received a Qualifying Offer (defined below) from any Club  \n(\u201cQualified Free Agent\u2019).  \nDuring the Quiet Period, the former Club of a Qualified Free  \nAgent may tender the Qualified Free Agent a one-year Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract for the next succeeding season with a guaranteed  \nsalary that is equal to the average salary of the 125 highest-paid  \nPlayers each year (\u201cQualifying Offer\u2019). The amount of the Quali-  \nfying Offer each year shall be determined pursuant to Attachment  \n45 to this Agreement, and shall be communicated to Clubs and  \nPlayers by the Parties within ten (10) days of the conclusion of the  \nchampionship season. Clubs shall inform the LRD of the Office of  \nthe Commissioner whether they will make a Qualifying Offer to a  \nQualified Free Agent, and the LRD will inform the Players Associ-  \nation no later than 5 P.M. Eastern Time on the last day of the Quiet  \nPeriod of each Club\u2019s Qualifying Offers to Qualified Free Agents.  \nIf the former Club of a Qualified Free Agent does not tender him a  \nQualifying Offer, it shall not be entitled to compensation under  \nparagraph (4) of this Section B with respect to that Qualified Free  \nAgent.  \nA Qualified Free Agent may accept a Qualifying Offer until the  \ntenth day following the conclusion of the Quiet Period (\u201cAccep-  \ntance Period\u2019\u2019). The Players Association shall provide the LRD with  \na list of the Qualified Free Agents who have accepted the Qualify-  \ning Offer by 5 P.M. Eastern Time of the final day of the Acceptance  \nPeriod. Any Qualified Free Agent whose name is not included on  \nthe list provided by the Players Association to the LRD will be  \ndeemed to have rejected the Qualifying Offer.  \nIf the Player accepts the Qualifying Offer, he shall be a signed  \nplayer for the next season on a one-year contract with a salary equal  \n94  \nto the amount of the Qualifying Offer, and shall be eligible for in-  \nseason termination pay as set forth in Article IX, Section C if his  \nContract 1s terminated under paragraph 7(b)(2) of the Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract from the date of acceptance through the conclu-  \nsion of the championship season.  \n(4) Compensation  \n(a) A Qualified Free Agent shall be subject to compensation only  \nif: (1) his former Club tenders him a Qualifying Offer pursuant to  \nparagraph (3) of this Section B; (11) the Player declines the Qualify-  \ning Offer or signs a contract with another Major League Club prior  \nto the expiration of the Acceptance Period; and (111) the Player signs  \na Major League contract with another Major League Club that is  \nconfirmed by the Players Association and the LRD on or before the  \nday prior to the next succeeding Major League Rule 4 Draft (\u201cRule  \n4 Draft\u2019). A Qualified Free Agent who signs a bona fide Minor  \nLeague contract shall not be subject to compensation irrespective of  \nwhether the Minor League contract is subsequently assigned to the  \nMajor League Club. No Club and Player may enter into any Major  \nLeague or Minor League contract, or assign such a contract, with  \nthe intent to circumvent Article XX(B)(3) or XX(B)(4).  \n(b) Former Club. The former Club of a Qualified Free Agent  \nsubject to compensation (\u201cFormer Club\u2019\u2019) shall receive an amateur  \ndraft choice (\u201cSpecial Draft Choice\u2019) immediately following the  \nlast selection in Competitive Balance Round B of the next Rule 4  \nDraft. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Former Club that was a  \nRevenue Sharing Payee (as defined in Article XXIV) and not mar-  \nket disqualified in the Revenue Sharing Year that encompasses the  \nmost recently completed championship season shall receive a  \nSpecial Draft Choice immediately following the last selection in the  \nfirst round of the next Rule 4 Draft if its Qualified Free Agent sub-  \nject to compensation enters into a contract with another Club with a  \ntotal guarantee of $50 million or more; and (11) a Former Club that  \nwas a CBT Payor in the Contract Year that encompasses the most  \nrecently completed championship season (regardless of the Former  \nClub\u2019s status under the Revenue Sharing Plan) shall receive a  \nSpecial Draft Choice immediately following the last selection in the  \nfourth round of the next Rule 4 Draft. For purposes of the previous  \nsentence, the \u201ctotal guarantee\u201d of a contract signed by a Qualified  \n95  \nFree Agent shall include the following: (a) total salary in any guar-  \nanteed contract years (including any Player option years); (b) any  \nsigning bonus (regardless of when paid); (c) any buyout associated  \nwith the first Club or mutual option year; and (d) any performance,  \nroster, or award bonuses, escalators, or vesting options, but only to  \nthe extent the Player would have earned those bonuses, escalators,  \nor vesting options based on his performance in any prior season of  \nhis career. For the purposes of (a)-(d) above the value of any com-  \npensation payable pursuant to such a contract after the last  \nchampionship season covered by the contract shall be calculated in  \naccordance with Article XXIII(E)(6) (\u201cDeferred Compensation\u2019\u2019). If  \nmultiple Clubs that have lost Qualified Free Agents subject to com-  \npensation receive a Special Draft Choice after the same round of the  \nnext Rule 4 Draft, those Special Draft Choices will be sequenced in  \nthe reverse order of the recipient Clubs\u2019 won-lost percentage in the  \nmost recently completed season. If a Club is entitled to more than  \none Special Draft Choice after the same round of the next Rule 4  \nDraft, its selections will be slotted in succession. If two or more  \nClubs had an identical won-lost percentage in the most recently  \ncompleted season, the Clubs shall select in the reverse order of their  \nwinning percentages in the season prior to the most recently com-  \npleted season, with any remaining ties to be resolved based on pre-  \nceding season winning percentages.  \n(c) Signing Club  \n(i) As set forth below, for each Qualified Free Agent subject  \nto compensation whom it signs, the signing Club (\u201cSigning  \nClub\u2019\u2019) shall have its Signing Bonus Pool in the next international  \nsigning period (as described in Attachment 46) reduced and/or  \nforfeit one or more selections in the next Rule 4 Draft, as follows:  \n(A) If the Signing Club was a Revenue Sharing Payee (as  \ndefined in Article XXIV) and not market disqualified in the  \nRevenue Sharing Year that encompasses the most recently  \ncompleted championship season, it shall forfeit its third-high-  \nest available selection in the next Rule 4 Draft.  \n(B) Notwithstanding subsection (A) above, if the Signing  \nClub was a CBT Payor in the Contract Year (as defined in  \nArticle XXIII) that encompasses the most recently completed  \n96  \nchampionship season, it shall forfeit its second-highest and  \nfifth-highest available selections in the next Rule 4 Draft, and  \nit shall have its international Signing Bonus Pool for the next  \ninternational signing period reduced by $1 million.  \n(C) Any Signing Club not covered by subsections (A) or  \n(B) above shall forfeit its second-highest available selection in  \nthe next Rule 4 Draft and shall have its international Signing  \nBonus Pool for the next international signing period reduced  \nby $500,000.  \n(11) Draft selections shall be awarded and forfeited pursuant to  \nsubsections 4(b) and 4(c), respectively, as of the date the last  \nQualified Free Agent subject to compensation enters into a con-  \ntract that is confirmed by the Players Association and the LRD,  \nor the day prior to the next Rule 4 Draft, whichever occurs first.  \nThe draft selections forfeited by a Signing Club in the next Rule  \n4 Draft shall be determined as follows.  \n(A) Determining a Club\u2019s Highest Available Draft Selec-  \ntions. With the exception of draft selections forfeited by the  \nClub pursuant to Major League Rule 3(c)(4)(B), all of a Club\u2019s  \ndraft selections will be counted in determining the Club\u2019s sec-  \nond-highest, third-highest or fifth-highest available selections,  \nincluding compensatory selections awarded pursuant to sub-  \nsection 4(b) above and selections awarded pursuant to Major  \nLeague Rules 4(c)(2), 4(k)(1) or 4(k)(2) (or acquired via an  \nassignment).  \n(B) Draft Selections Subject to Forfeiture. With the excep-  \ntion of draft selections awarded to a Club pursuant to Major  \nLeague Rule 4(c)(2) or 4(k)(2), all of a Club\u2019s selections will  \nbe subject to forfeiture pursuant to subsection 4(c)(1) above,  \nincluding selections awarded pursuant to subsection 4(b)  \nabove. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Competitive Balance  \nSelections obtained through an assignment from another Club  \nwill be subject to forfeiture. If a Club\u2019s second-highest, third-  \nhighest or fifth-highest selection is a selection exempt from  \nforfeiture under this section, the Club shall forfeit its next  \nhighest available selection.  \n97  \n(C) Clubs That Sign More Than One Qualified Free Agent.  \nIf a Club\u2019s second-highest, third-highest or fifth-highest selec-  \ntion is no longer available because it was forfeited pursuant to  \nsubsection 4(c)(1) as a result of signing another Qualified Free  \nAgent, the Signing Club shall forfeit its next highest available  \nselection. By way of example, if a Club forfeited its second-  \nround selection and fifth-round selection for signing its first  \nQualified Free Agent pursuant to subsection 4(c)(1)(B) above,  \nit shall forfeit 1ts third-round selection and sixth-round selec-  \ntion for signing its next Qualified Free Agent (assuming those  \nare its next highest selections not exempt from forfeiture).  \nInternational Signing Bonus Pool amounts forfeited pur-  \nsuant to this subsection (4)(c) shall be reallocated equally among  \nthe international Signing Bonus Pools among Clubs that did not  \nforfeit Pool space pursuant to this Section. If the amount of Sign-  \ning Bonus Pool space that a Club forfeits pursuant to subsection  \n4(c)(1) above exceeds the Club\u2019s available Signing Bonus Pool  \nspace in the next international signing period, the remaining for-  \nfeited amount shall be deducted from the Club\u2019s Signing Bonus  \nPool in each subsequent international signing period until the full  \namount has been deducted.  \n(iv) For purposes of subsection 4(b) above and this subsection  \n4(c), the Oakland Athletics shall be considered market disquali-  \nfied beginning with the off-season following the 2020 season.  \n(5) Miscellaneous  \n(a) Any Club signing a contract with a Player under this Article  \nXX(B) after the expiration of the Quiet Period described in subsec-  \ntion 2(b) above may not assign his contract until after the next June  \n15. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, such contract may be  \nassigned for other Player contracts and/or cash consideration of  \n$50,000 or less prior to the next June 16 if the Player gives written  \nconsent to such transaction.  \n(b) There shall be no restriction or interference with the right of  \na free agent to negotiate or contract with any baseball club outside  \nthe structure of organized baseball, nor shall there be any compen-  \nsation paid for the loss of a free agent except as provided for in this  \nArticle XX(B).  \n98  \n(c) A Club and Player (or their designated representatives) shall  \nnot enter into any agreement, understanding or contract, or make  \nany representation, promise or commitment, whether implied or  \nexplicit, either orally or in writing, that the Club will not make a  \nQualifying Offer to a Player, or that a Player will not accept a Qual-  \nifying Offer if one is tendered to him. Any Club or Club employee  \nthat violates this provision will be subject to discipline by the Com-  \nmissioner, including the potential forfeiture of draft selections.  \n(d) Retention Bonus  \n(1) If a Club signs a Player who became a free agent pursuant  \nto this Article XX(B) to a Minor League Uniform Player Contract  \nbetween the date the Player became a free agent as set forth in  \nsubsection B(2)(a) above and ten days prior to the commence-  \nment of the next succeeding championship season, the Club shall  \npay the Player a retention bonus of $100,000 if, by 12 P.M. East-  \nern Time on the fifth day prior to the first day of the champion-  \nship season, (1) the Club does not agree in writing to add the  \nPlayer to its Opening Day 25-man roster or Major League Dis-  \nabled List at the commencement of the championship season, or  \n(11) the Club does not provide the Player with his immediate  \nunconditional release.  \n(11) If a Club agrees to add a Player to its Opening Day 25-  \nman roster or Major League Disabled List at the commencement  \nof the championship season pursuant to subsection (d)(i) above,  \nthe Club must notify the LRD of its decision either to add the  \nPlayer to its Opening Day 25-man roster or Major League Dis-  \nabled List no later than 12 P.M. Eastern Time on the fifth day  \nprior to the first day of the championship season, and the LRD  \nwill inform the Players Association.  \n(111) The $100,000 retention bonus described in subsection  \n(d)(1) above must be paid on or before April 15 of the next suc-  \nceeding championship season. Such bonus shall not be subject to  \nthe non-duplication provision contained in Article IX(F) of this  \nAgreement.  \n(iv) Ifa Club elects to retain a Player under his Minor League  \nUniform Player Contract pursuant to subparagraph (1) above by  \npaying the $100,000 retention bonus, the Player may require the  \n99  \nClub to provide him with his unconditional release on June 1 if  \nhe had not been added to the Club\u2019s 25-man roster or placed on  \nthe Major League Disabled List at any time prior to June 1. The  \nPlayer must notify the Club in writing no later than 2 P.M. East-  \nern Time on May 28 that he is requesting his unconditional  \nrelease by 2 P.M. Eastern Time on June | if the Club does not  \nadd him to its 25-man roster or Major League Disabled List by  \nthat time.  \n(v) A Club and Player may agree to a special covenant to a  \nMinor League Uniform Player Contract for a Player covered by  \nthis subsection (5)(d) that provides the Player with a retention  \nbonus greater than $100,000, an earlier deadline for adding the  \nPlayer to its Opening Day 25-man roster or Major League Dis-  \nabled List, an advanced payment schedule for the bonus, or an  \nearlier date by which the Player may require the Club to provide  \nhim with his unconditional release. Nothing contained herein is  \nintended to modify any other provision contained under this  \nAgreement or the Major League Rules with respect to permissible  \nspecial covenants in a Minor League Uniform Player Contract.  \n(vi) This subsection (5)(d) shall apply to Players who became  \nfree agents pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article  \nXX(B)(1) and (2) above, and shall not apply to Players who  \nbecame free agents pursuant to any other provision of the Basic  \nAgreement or a special covenant to a Major League Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract.  \n(ec) The exercise dates of option provisions contained in Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contracts all must fall within the Quiet Period described in  \nsubparagraph (2)(b) above.  \nC. [Reserved]  \nD. Outright Assignment to Minor League Club  \n(1) Election of Free Agency\u20143-Year Player  \nAny Player who has at least 3 years of Major League service, or  \nwho qualified as a \u201cSuper Two\u201d Player under Article VI(E)(1)(b) as  \nof the conclusion of the prior championship season, and whose con-  \ntract is assigned outright to a Minor League club may elect, in lieu of  \n100  \naccepting such assignment, to become a free agent. In the event that  \nsuch a Player with at least 3 years of Major League service does not  \nelect free agency in lieu of accepting such assignment, he may elect  \nfree agency between the end of the then current Major League sea-  \nson and the next following October 15, unless such Player is returned  \nto a Major League roster prior to making such election. Any Player  \nwho accepts an outright assignment as a \u201cSuper Two\u201d Player will not  \nretain a right to elect free agency following the season.  \n(2) Election of Free Agency\u2014Second Outright Assignment  \nAny Player whose contract is assigned outright to a Minor  \nLeague club for the second time or any subsequent time in his career  \nmay elect, in lieu of accepting such assignment, to become a free  \nagent. In the event that such Player does not elect free agency in lieu  \nof accepting such assignment, he may elect free agency between the  \nend of the then current Major League season and the next following  \nOctober 15, unless such Player is returned to a Major League roster  \nprior to making such election.  \n(3) Effect of Free Agency Election  \nA Player who becomes a free agent under this Article XX(D)  \nshall immediately be eligible to negotiate and contract with any  \nClub without any restrictions or qualifications, and shall not be enti-  \ntled to receive termination pay; provided, however, if such election  \nwould result in the forfeiture of termination pay, the election shall  \nnot become effective unless and until the Association confirms the  \nelection in writing. Such a free agent shall receive transportation  \nand travel expenses in the same manner as he would if he had been  \nunconditionally released except he shall be limited to receiving  \ntravel expenses to his new club if he reports to it directly, provided  \nsuch expenses are less than to his home city.  \n(4) Procedure  \nNot earlier than 4 days prior to the contemplated date of an out-  \nright assignment, or 8 days, if the Player has no options remaining  \nor if the assignment is during the period from the close of the  \nchampionship season to the opening of Spring Training, the Club  \nshall give written notice to the Player, with a copy to the Associa-  \n101  \ntion, which shall advise the Player that he may either (a) accept the  \nassignment or (b) elect to become a free agent, and that in the event  \nhe accepts the assignment, he may (except in the case of a \u201cSuper  \nTwo\u201d Player who accepts a first outright assignment) elect free  \nagency between the end of the then current Major League season  \nand the next following October 15, unless he is returned to a Major  \nLeague roster prior to making such election. The Player shall also  \nbe informed in the notice that, within 2 days after the date of the  \nnotice, or 3 days, if during the period from the close of the  \nchampionship season to the opening of Spring Training, he must  \nadvise the Club in writing as to his decision whether to accept the  \nassignment. No such decision from a Player shall be considered  \neffective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club\u2019s  \nnotice. If the Club fails to give written notice, as set forth herein, to  \nthe Player prior to the date of such assignment, the Player may, at  \nany time, elect to become a free agent pursuant to this Article  \nXX(D); provided, however, that if the Club subsequently gives  \nsuch written notice to the Player, he shall, within 3 days thereafter,  \nor 10 days, if during the period from the close of the championship  \nseason to the opening of Spring Training, advise the Club in writ-  \ning as to his decision. No such decision from a Player shall be con-  \nsidered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the  \nClub\u2019s notice.  \nE. Individual Nature of Rights  \n(1) The utilization or non-utilization of rights under Article  \nXIX(A)(2) and Article XX is an individual matter to be determined  \nsolely by each Player and each Club for his or its own benefit. Play-  \ners shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act  \nin concert with other Clubs.  \n(2) Upon any finding of a violation of Section E(1) of this Arti-  \ncle XX by two or more Clubs, any injured Player (or Players) shall  \nbe entitled to recover in monetary damages three (3) times the lost  \nbaseball income, he (or they) would have had but for the violation.  \nSuch lost baseball income shall be limited to lost salary and other  \nlost contractual terms, including lost additional contract years, lost  \nsigning bonuses, lost trade restriction provisions, lost option buyout  \nprovisions, and lost incentive bonuses (e.g., performance, awards,  \n102  \nattendance and weight bonuses). Damages (and fees and interest)  \nmay be recovered only from the Clubs found to have violated Sec-  \ntion E(1) of this Article XX.  \n(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Basic Agree-  \nment, the Arbitration Panel shall further order payment by the Clubs  \nfound to have violated Section E(1) of this Article XX of all reason-  \nable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, expert witness fees and expenses  \nand prejudgment interest on the single damage calculation of the  \nlost baseball income pursuant to paragraph (2).  \n(4) Any injured Player (or Players or the Association) shall not  \nbe entitled to recover any monetary damages pursuant to this  \nArticle XX(E) other than those enumerated in paragraphs (2) and  \n(3). However, nothing in paragraphs (2) and (3) is intended to reflect  \nany agreement between the Parties on mitigation issues.  \n(5) In addition, upon any finding by the Arbitration Panel of a  \nviolation by five (5) Clubs or more of Section E(1) of this Article  \nXX, the Association shall have the right to reopen this Agreement  \nupon sixty (60) days written notice to the LRD.  \n(6) Upon any finding by the Arbitration Panel of a violation of  \nSection E(1) of this Article XX by two (2) or more Clubs, any  \ninjured free agent Player will have the right to terminate his exist-  \ning contract (or reserve status) at his option immediately following  \nthe issuance of the finding by the Arbitration Panel. However, no  \nsuch termination shall take effect during the period beginning on  \nFebruary 15 and ending with the conclusion of the World Series. If  \nthe finding of the Arbitration Panel is issued at any time on or after  \nJanuary 15, but before February 15, the Player shall have the right  \nto terminate his existing contract (or reserve status) at his option  \neither (a) immediately; or (b) within the fifteen (15) day period fol-  \nlowing the conclusion of the next succeeding World Series. At the  \ntime any contract (or reserve status) is terminated pursuant to this  \nparagraph (6), such free agent Player shall immediately have the  \nright to negotiate with and enter into a contract with any Club, with-  \nout any restrictions or qualifications. If the contract (or reserve sta-  \ntus) is terminated, the free agent Player may choose to reinstate his  \ncontract (or reserve status) at any time up until the March 15 suc-  \nceeding such termination.  \n103  \n(7) If a Player does not exercise his right pursuant to paragraph  \n(6) to reinstate his contract (or reserve status), all obligations of the  \nPlayer and of the Club under said contract (or reserve status) shall  \ncease as of the end of the period in which the Player has the right to  \nreinstate his contract (or reserve status), except the obligation of the  \nClub to pay the Player\u2019s compensation to that date. If at the end of  \nthe period the Player has not signed a new contract and has not exer-  \ncised his right to reinstate his existing contract (or reserve status), at  \nthat point, the Player shall be considered an unrestricted free agent.  \n(8) Utilization or non-utilization of the procedures set forth in  \nparagraph (6) above shall be without prejudice to any injured free  \nagent Player. However, the experience of each Player who utilizes  \nsuch procedures shall be considered by the Arbitration Panel in  \ndetermining such further relief, if any, to which he may be entitled.  \n(9) It is understood that in the event of a violation of Section  \nE(1) of this Article XX, the Arbitration Panel shall have the author-  \nity to order such other and further non-monetary (e.g., injunctive)  \nrelief as may be necessary to give full force and effect to the pur-  \nposes of and to the rights and benefits afforded to Players under this  \nArticle XX.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XXI\u2014Credited Major League Service  \nA. Definitions  \n", "Those Player rights expressly set forth in the Basic Agreement for  \nwhich a Player\u2019s eligibility is dependent upon credited Major League  \nservice will be determined as follows:  \n(1) One full day of Major League service will be credited for  \neach day of the championship season a Player is on a Major League  \nClub\u2019s Active List. A total of 172 days of Major League credited  \nservice will constitute one full year of credited service. A Player  \nmay not be credited with more than one year of credited service, 172  \ndays, in one championship season (including any tie-breaker  \ngames). Major League service will be computed commencing with  \nthe date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game,  \nthrough and including the date of the last regularly scheduled  \nchampionship season game; provided, however, that one full day of  \nMajor League service shall also be credited for any tiebreaker game  \n104  \nplayed following the conclusion of the last regularly scheduled  \nchampionship season game but before the commencement of post-  \nseason play pursuant to Major League Rule 33(c) (subject to the  \nmaximum of 172 service days in any season). This rule shall apply  \nuniformly to all Players and all Clubs notwithstanding differences in  \na particular Club\u2019s schedule.  \n(2) For purposes of calculating credited service, a Player will be  \nconsidered to be on a Club\u2019s Active List if:  \n(a) placed on a disciplinary suspension by a Club, the Chief  \nBaseball Officer or the Commissioner, or on the Disabled List; or  \n(b) called to active military duty for up to two years or if called  \nto emergency duty by the National Guard for a period of up to  \nthirty days.  \nB. Optional Assignments  \nIf a Player is optionally assigned for a total of less than 20 days in one  \nchampionship season, the Player shall be credited with Major League  \nservice during the period of such optional assignment(s); provided,  \nhowever, that a Player shall not be credited with Major League service  \nunder this provision if the Player had zero days of Major League serv-  \nice in the current season prior to the optional assignment and after the  \noptional assignment was unconditionally released or assigned outright  \nand not subsequently added to the Active List for the remainder of the  \nchampionship season. See Article XIX(E).  \nFor purposes of counting days on option, the date of the optional  \nassignment shall be counted and the date of recall shall not be counted,  \nprovided that the date of the optional assignment shall not be counted  \nif the assignment takes place after the start of a Major League game in  \nwhich the Player otherwise would have been eligible to play, and the  \ndate of recall shall be counted if the recall takes place after the start of  \nany Minor League game in which the Player was eligible to play.

To the extent that a Contract  \nYear is referenced by a number in connection with a particular cal-  \nculation, the reference shall be to the calendar year of the champion-  \nship season that falls in that Contract Year.  \n(2) \u201cUniform Player\u2019s Contract\u201d shall mean a Major League  \nUniform Player\u2019s Contract. (See Appendix A.)  \n(3) \u201cSplit Contract\u201d shall mean a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract  \nwhich sets out separate rates of pay for service with a Minor League  \nclub and service with a Major League Club.  \n(4) \u201cImputed Loan Interest Rate\u201d for each Contract Year shall  \nmean the annual \u201cFederal mid-term rate\u201d as defined in Section  \n1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the October preceding  \nthat Contract Year.  \n(5) \u201cPerformance Bonus\u201d shall mean a payment to a Player con-  \nditioned upon the Player having achieved certain specified levels of  \nactivity, provided that such bonuses must be consistent with Major  \nLeague Rule 3(b).  \n(6) \u201cAward Bonus\u201d shall mean a payment to a Player condi-  \ntioned upon the Player having achieved a particular status in con-  \nnection with a recognized or agreed-upon award or honor.  \n(7) \u201cBase Salary\u201d shall mean the amount set out in paragraph 2  \nof a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract for a given championship season or  \nany amount included in a Special Covenant in lieu of inclusion in  \nparagraph 2.  \n(8) \u201cGuaranteed Year\u201d shall mean any championship season  \nincluded in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract for which more than 50%  \nof the Player\u2019s Base Salary is guaranteed by the Contract in the  \nevent of termination under paragraph 7(b)(2).  \n106  \n(9) \u201cBase Tax Threshold\u201d shall be defined as provided in Section  \nB below.  \n(10) \u201cSurcharge Thresholds\u201d shall be defined as provided in Sec-  \ntion B below.  \n(11) \u201cActual Club Payroll\u201d shall be defined as provided in Sec-  \ntion C below. Each Club\u2019s final Actual Club Payroll for a Contract  \nYear in which the Competitive Balance Tax is applicable shall be  \ncalculated on the December 2 following that Contract Year and shall  \nbe the exclusive figure used for the purpose of determining whether  \na Club has exceeded the Base Tax or Surcharge Thresholds.  \n(12) \u201cSalary\u201d shall be defined as provided in Section E below  \nand shall be attributable to Contract Years as provided in Sections C  \nand E below.  \n(13) \u201cBenefits\u201d or \u201cPlayer Benefit Costs\u201d shall be defined as  \nprovided in Section D below.  \nB. Determination of Competitive Balance Tax  \n(1) Calculation of Tax  \nA Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds the Base Tax  \nThreshold applicable in that Contract Year (\u201cTax Threshold\u201d or  \n\u201cBase Tax shall be assessed a Competitive Balance Tax  \non the difference between its final Actual Club Payroll and the Base  \nTax Threshold. In addition, a Club with an Actual Club Payroll that  \nexceeds one or both of the Surcharge Thresholds shall be assessed  \nan additional Competitive Balance Tax as described below. A Club  \nwith an Actual Club Payroll at or below the Base Tax Threshold  \nshall incur no Competitive Balance Tax for that Contract Year.  \n(2) Base Tax Thresholds  \nThe Base Tax Threshold shall be $195 million in the 2017 Con-  \ntract Year, $197 million in the 2018 Contract Year, $206 million in  \nthe 2019 Contract Year, $208 million in the 2020 Contract Year, and  \n$210 million in the 2021 Contract Year.  \n(3) Base Tax Rates  \nThe Base Competitive Balance Tax rates are provided below.  \n107  \n(a) For a Club that has an Actual Club Payroll above the Base  \nTax Threshold in any Contract Year, the applicable Competitive  \nBalance Tax rate shall be:  \n(1) 20% if the Club did not exceed the Base Tax Threshold  \nin the preceding Contract Year (\u2018First-Time CBT Payor\u2019);  \n(ii) 30% if the Club exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in  \nthe preceding Contract Year, but did not exceed the Base Tax  \nThreshold in the Contract Year two years prior (\u201cSecond-Time  \nCBT Payor\u2019); and  \n(111) 50% if the Club exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in  \nboth of the two preceding Contract Years (or in more than two  \npreceding Contract Years) (\u201cThird-Time CBT Payor\u2019).  \n(b) In determining in how many consecutive preceding Con-  \ntract Years a Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll exceeded the Base Tax  \nThreshold (and, accordingly, whether a Club is a First-, Second-,  \nor Third-Time CBT Payor), instances in which the Club\u2019s Actual  \nClub Payroll exceeded the \u201cTax Threshold\u201d (as defined in Article  \nXXIII of the 2012\u20142016 Basic Agreement) in any Contract Year  \ncovered by the 2012\u20142016 Basic Agreement shall be counted. To  \nillustrate, a Club that had an Actual Club Payroll above $189 mil-  \nlion in both the 2015 and 2016 Contract Years (when, under the  \nterms of the 2012\u20142016 Basic Agreement, the Tax Threshold was  \n$189 million), and has an Actual Club Payroll for the 2017 Con-  \ntract Year that exceeds $195 million (the Base Tax Threshold for  \nthe 2017 Contract Year), shall be deemed to have exceeded the  \nBase Tax Thresholds in the two Contract Years prior to the 2017  \nContract Year and, therefore, would be considered a Third-Time  \nCBT Payor and charged a Base Tax Rate of 50% in 2017.  \n(4) Surcharge Thresholds, Rates, and Penalties  \nIn addition to the Base Tax Threshold for each Contract Year,  \nthere shall be two Surcharge Thresholds. A Club with an Actual  \nClub Payroll that exceeds one or both of the Surcharge Thresholds  \napplicable in that Contract Year shall be assessed an additional  \nCompetitive Balance Tax on the amount by which its Actual Club  \nPayroll exceeds the Surcharge Threshold(s), as set forth below.  \n108  \n(a) Surcharge Thresholds  \n(i) First Surcharge Threshold: The First Surcharge  \nThreshold shall be $215 million in the 2017 Contract Year,  \n$217 million in the 2018 Contract Year, $226 million in the  \n2019 Contract Year, $228 million in the 2020 Contract Year,  \nand $230 million in the 2021 Contract Year.  \n(41) Second Surcharge Threshold: The Second Surcharge  \nThreshold shall be $235 million in the 2017 Contract Year,  \n$237 million in the 2018 Contract Year, $246 million in the  \n2019 Contract Year, $248 million in the 2020 Contract Year,  \nand $250 million in the 2021 Contract Year.  \n(b) Surcharge Rates  \nIn addition to the Base Tax Rate applicable to the amount by  \nwhich Actual Club Payroll exceeds the Base Tax Threshold, Clubs  \nwith an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds one or both Surcharge  \nThresholds will pay an additional Competitive Balance Tax on the  \namount of its Actual Club Payroll over the applicable Surcharge  \nThreshold(s) for that Contract Year. All proceeds generated as a  \nresult of these surcharges shall be considered proceeds of the  \nCompetitive Balance Tax for purposes of Section B(6) below.  \n(i) Surcharge Rate for Exceeding the First Surcharge  \nThreshold: A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds  \nthe First Surcharge Threshold shall pay a 12% surcharge rate,  \non top of the applicable Base Tax Rate, on the amount of its  \nActual Club Payroll above the First Surcharge Threshold but  \nat or below the Second Surcharge Threshold.  \n(11) Surcharge Rate for Exceeding the Second Surcharge  \nThreshold: A Club with an Actual Payroll that exceeds the  \nSecond Surcharge Threshold in any Contract Year shall pay an  \nadditional 45% surcharge rate, on top of the applicable Base  \nTax Rate, on the difference between its Actual Club Payroll  \nand the Second Surcharge Threshold. Notwithstanding the  \nforegoing, a First-Time CBT Payor Club shall be charged a  \n42.5% surcharge rate (rather than the 45% surcharge rate  \napplicable to Second- or Third-Time CBT Payor Clubs) on the  \ndifference between its Actual Club Payroll and the Second  \nSurcharge Threshold.  \n109  \nThe following chart summarizes the Competitive Balance  \nTax rate a First-, Second-, and Third-Time CBT Payor would  \nincur on the portions of its Actual Club Payroll exceeding the  \nBase Tax Threshold, the First Surcharge Threshold, and the  \nSecond Surcharge Threshold.  \nAGL First-Time |Second-Time | Third-Timet+  \nPayroll Exceeds Base  \nTax Threshold ($M) | CBT Payor | CBT Payor | CBT Payor  \n\u00a3520 (Base Tax Rate)  \n$20-$40 (Base Tax +  \nIst Surcharge Rate) a  \n>$40 (Base Tax +  \nBy way of illustration, a Third-Time CBT Payor Club with  \na $260 million payroll in 2018 will pay a 50% tax rate on its  \npayroll between $197 million and $217 million; a 62% tax rate  \non its payroll between $217 million and $237 million; and a  \n95% tax rate on payroll in excess of $237 million.  \n   \n(c) Rule 4 Draft Selection Penalty for Exceeding Second  \nSurcharge Threshold  \nBeginning in the 2018 Contract Year and continuing thereafter,  \nany Club with an Actual Club Payroll at or above the applicable  \nSecond Surcharge Threshold in that Contract Year shall have its  \nhighest available selection in the next Rule 4 Draft moved back  \nten places in the Draft order. This penalty will apply in each Con-  \ntract Year in which the Club exceeds the Second Surcharge  \nThreshold, regardless of whether the Club is a First-, Second-, or  \nThird-Time CBT Payor or whether the Club has incurred the  \nsame penalty for exceeding the Second Surcharge Threshold in a  \nprior year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Club shall not have  \nits highest available selection moved back in the Draft if that  \nselection is in the top six selections of the first round of the Draft  \n(not including supplemental selections awarded pursuant to  \nMajor League Rule 4(c)(2)), but rather shall have its second-  \nhighest selection moved back ten places.  \nFor purposes of this section, a Club\u2019s highest available selec-  \ntion or second-highest available selection in the next Rule 4  \n110  \nDraft, whichever is applicable, shall be determined after account-  \ning for any selections received or forfeited pursuant to Article  \nXX(B)(4) or Major League Rules 3(c)(4)(B), 4(c)(2), or 4(k); or  \nselections acquired via assignment.  \nThe penalty shall be assessed immediately preceding the Rule  \n4 Draft.  \n(5) Phase-In for the 2017 Contract Year  \nFor the 2017 Contract Year only, a Club\u2019s Competitive Balance  \nTax obligation and/or penalties shall be the lesser of: (1) the amount  \nof Competitive Balance Tax the Club would owe for the 2017 Con-  \ntract Year under the terms of Sections B(1)-(4) above; and (11) the  \naverage of the amount of Competitive Balance Tax the Club would  \nowe for the 2017 Contract Year under the terms of Sections B(1)-(4)  \nabove and the amount of Competitive Balance Tax the Club would  \nhave owed had the terms of Article XXIII in effect in 2016 (1.e., a  \n$189 million Tax Threshold and the Competitive Balance Tax rates  \nset forth in Article XXIII(B)(3) of the 2012\u20142016 Basic Agreement)  \nremained in effect in 2017.  \n(6) Collection of Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  \n(a) On the December 2 following each Contract Year, the  \nCommissioner\u2019s Office shall notify the Association and all Clubs  \nof any amounts owed by any Clubs under the Competitive Bal-  \nance Tax. Clubs shall make Competitive Balance Tax payments  \nto the Commissioner\u2019s Office on or before January 21 of the next  \ncalendar year.  \n(b) Any Club that does not remit the full amount of the Com-  \npetitive Balance Tax due by that date shall have its next Major  \nLeague Central Fund (\u201cCentral Fund\u2019\u2019) distribution and subse-  \nquent distributions, each net of any debt service obligation under  \nthe industry credit facility, reduced by up to 50% until such obli-  \ngation is satisfied. For purposes of this subparagraph (b) only,  \nroyalty payments from Major League Baseball Properties shall  \nnot be considered part of a Club\u2019s Central Fund distribution.  \nBeginning with the day following the payment date specified in  \nsubparagraph (a) above, interest shall be charged on any unpaid  \nCompetitive Balance Tax amounts at the Imputed Loan Interest  \n111  \nRate for the then current Contract Year. Any interest collected  \npursuant to the preceding sentence shall be for the benefit of and  \nmade available to the Industry Growth Fund.  \nC. Determination of Actual Club Payroll  \n(1) Definition of Actual Club Payroll  \n\u201cActual Club Payroll\u201d of a Club in a Contract Year shall be the  \nsum of:  \n(a) a 1/30th share of Player Benefit Costs (and a similar pro  \nrata share if the number of Major League Clubs changes), as  \ndetermined in Section D below;  \n(b) the sum of the yearly Salaries (as determined in accor-  \ndance with Section E below and as allocated among Clubs in  \naccordance with this Section C) attributable to that Contract Year  \nof all Players under a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract with the Club  \nfor that Contract Year (including optionally assigned contracts);  \nand  \n(c) any other amount includible in or deductible from Actual  \nClub Payroll as a result of the operation of Section C(2)(f) below  \nor as aresult of any Club, any Player and/or either of the Parties  \nhereto having engaged in a transaction contrary to Section G(1)  \nbelow or as a result of an award by the Arbitration Panel under  \nArticle XI and/or Section F below.  \n(2) Rules for Allocation of Salary  \n(a) General Rule  \nIf a Player remains on a Major League Club\u2019s Active List (as  \ndefined in Article XXI) for an entire championship season, then  \nall of the Salary attributable to the Contract Year in which that  \nchampionship season falls shall be allocated to the Club\u2019s Actual  \nClub Payroll in that Contract Year.  \n(b) Assignment of Contract  \n(1) General Rule: Ifa Uniform Player\u2019s Contract is assigned  \nby any means to another Major League Club, the assignor Club  \nshall be allocated Salary through the date of the assignment and  \n112  \nSalary shall begin being allocated to the assignee Club on the fol-  \nlowing day, regardless of the Player\u2019s reporting date.  \n(41) Bonuses: Salary arising from Performance Bonuses  \nearned after the assignment shall be allocated between the  \nassignor and assignee Clubs in proportion to the total number of  \nrelevant events attained during the Contract Year with each Club.  \nSalary arising from Award Bonuses earned after the assignment  \nand within the Contract Year of the assignment shall be allocated  \nto the Actual Club Payrolls of the assignor and assignee Clubs  \npursuant to Section C(2)(b)(1) above. Salary arising from assign-  \nment bonuses earned upon or after the assignment and within the  \nContract Year of the assignment shall be included in the Actual  \nClub Payroll of the Club(s) responsible for paying it in the Con-  \ntract Year in which the bonus is earned.  \n(111) Cash Consideration: An assignor Club that pays cash  \nconsideration to defray all or part of the salary obligation of the  \nassignee Club for an assigned Player or Players shall include  \nsuch cash consideration in its Actual Club Payroll on a pro-rata  \nbasis over the remaining Guaranteed Years of the assigned Con-  \ntract(s). Cash consideration that is conditionally payable based  \non the Player\u2019s earning of performance or award bonuses will be  \nincluded in the Actual Club Payroll of the Club responsible for  \npaying the bonus in the Contract Year in which the bonus is  \nearned. Cash consideration that is conditionally payable based  \non the outcome of Club or Player Option decisions will be  \nincluded in the pro-rata calculation described above if the con-  \nsideration is contingent on the decline of a Club Option Year or  \nthe exercise of a Player Option Year, but will not be included if  \ncontingent on the exercise of a Club Option Year or the decline  \nof a Player Option Year. If any cash consideration not originally  \nincluded in the pro-rata calculation described above is ultimately  \npaid as a result of the outcome of Club or Player Option deci-  \nsions, the cash consideration will be included in the Contract  \nYear(s) covered by the Club or Player Options. An assignor Club  \nthat pays cash consideration in lieu of assigning an unnamed  \nplayer shall include such cash consideration in its Actual Club  \nPayroll in the Contract Year in which the cash consideration  \nis paid.  \n113  \nAny cash consideration that is included in the Actual Club Pay-  \nroll of the payor Club shall be subtracted from the Actual Club  \nPayroll of the payee Club in the same Contract Year in which it is  \nadded to the payor Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll. Notwithstanding  \nthe foregoing, an assignee Club may not receive an aggregate  \ncredit against its Actual Club Payroll(s) for cash consideration  \nreceived in an assignment that exceeds the sum of (a) the total  \namount of the acquired Player(s) Salaries that are included in the  \nClub\u2019s Actual Club Payroll(s) following the assignment, and (b)  \nany cash consideration paid by the assignee Club to another Club  \nin a subsequent assignment of the acquired Player(s) that is attrib-  \nutable to those Players.  \n(iv) Salary Increase Upon Assignment: Ifa Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract provides for an increase in Salary upon its assignment  \nto another Major League Club, such increase shall be included in  \na Player\u2019s Salary upon assignment and attributed to the Contract  \nYear (or Years) in which it is to be paid. Any such increase in  \nSalary attributable to the Contract Year during which the assign-  \nment occurred shall be treated as an assignment bonus and allo-  \ncated to the Actual Club Payrolls of the assignor and assignee  \nClubs pursuant to Section C(2)(b)(i1) above. Any such increase in  \nSalary attributable to a later Contract Year shall be allocated  \nexclusively to the assignee Club.  \n(c) Contract Signed After Opening Day  \nIf a Player first enters into a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract with a  \nClub after Opening Day of the championship season with a Base  \nSalary payable over a full championship season, the Club shall  \ninclude in Actual Club Payroll such pro rata portion of the Base  \nSalary attributable to that Contract Year as the number of days  \nthat the Player was on the Club\u2019s Active List (as defined in  \nArticle XXI) bears to the number of days in the championship  \nseason. Notwithstanding the above, if such Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract covers multiple championship seasons, the Club shall  \ninstead include in Actual Club Payroll for the first championship  \nseason covered by the Contract the amount calculated pursuant to  \nsubsection E(2) below.  \n114  \n(d) Termination of Contract  \n(1) Ifa Club terminates a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract that cov-  \ners a single championship season, the Club shall include in its  \nActual Club Payroll for the Contract Year in which that season  \nfalls any Salary paid to that Player, either under this Agreement  \nor a Special Covenant to the Contract (subject to any offset called  \nfor by this Agreement or a Special Covenant).  \n(11) If a Club terminates a multi-year Uniform Player\u2019s Con-  \ntract while it remains obligated to pay Salary under either this  \nAgreement or a Special Covenant to the Contract, Salary shall be  \nallocated to that Club for each Contract Year during which its  \nobligation continues. Salary shall be attributed to each such Con-  \ntract Year pursuant to this Article XXIII (subject to any offset  \ncalled for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant). This attribu-  \ntion shall apply even if the Club pays the Salary in advance.  \n(e) Split Contracts  \nThe earnings of a Player signatory to a Split Contract shall be  \nincluded in Actual Club Payroll at the total amount of the  \nPlayer\u2019s actual baseball earnings under that Contract from Major  \nLeague Clubs (and from Minor League clubs, if any) for that  \nContract Year.  \n(f) Outright Assignment to a Minor League club  \nAny Uniform Player\u2019s Contract that is assigned outright to a  \nMinor League club during the term of this Agreement shall be  \nincluded in the Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll. Any Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract that was assigned outright to a Minor League  \nclub prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall be  \nexcluded from Actual Club Payroll; provided, however, that if  \nany Uniform Player\u2019s Contract that was assigned outright to a  \nMinor League club prior to this Agreement is subsequently  \nselected to a Club\u2019s 40-man roster, the entire remaining Salary  \nunder that Uniform Player\u2019s Contract shall be included in Actual  \nClub Payroll, even if the Player is thereafter assigned outright to  \na Minor League club.  \n115  \nD. Benefits or Player Benefit Costs  \n(1) Definition  \nThe Clubs\u2019 Benefits or Player Benefit Costs for a particular Con-  \ntract Year shall include the sums paid (or to be paid on a proper  \naccrual basis for that Contract Year) by or on behalf of the Clubs for,  \nto, or on behalf of present Players (and former Players when  \nexpressly noted) for:  \n(a) contributions to the Major League Baseball Players Bene-  \nfit Plan, in the full amounts called for by paragraph 5 of the  \nAgreement re Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan  \n(including contributions made on behalf of former Players and  \nothers but excluding contributions made from Competitive Bal-  \nance Tax proceeds);  \n(b) workers\u2019 compensation premiums, payroll, unemployment  \ncompensation and social security taxes (including payments  \nmade on behalf of a Player released from a Contract that covers  \nthat Contract Year, provided that the Player\u2019s Salary is included  \nin a Club\u2019s final Actual Club Payroll for that Contract Year);  \n(c) Spring Training allowances (as described in Article  \nVII(C)), championship season meal and tip allowances (as  \ndescribed in Article VII(B)), All-Star Game expenses (as  \ndescribed in Article VII(D)) and \u201cin-season supplemental  \nallowances\u201d (as described in Article VII(E));  \n(d) moving and traveling expenses (as described in Article  \nVIII), including payments made to former Players in connection  \nwith relocations resulting from assignments while they were  \nactive Players;  \n(e) contributions (in their entirety) to the post-season Players\u2019  \npool as described in Article X;  \n(f) the College Scholarship Plan and Continuing Education  \nProgram (including payments made on behalf of former players);  \nand  \n(g) player medical costs (e.g., fees to doctors, hospitals, and  \nother health care providers, and the drugs and other medical sup-  \nplies for the treatment of Player injuries), but not including  \nsalaries of trainers or other Club personnel, or the costs of Club  \n116  \nmedical or training equipment, or any costs reimbursed or paid for  \nthrough workers\u2019 compensation or any other medical insurance.  \nStarting with the 2017 Contract Year and for purposes of sub-  \nparagraph (a) above, the first $13 million of CBT proceeds in the  \nprior Contract Year (or whatever portion thereof if less than $13  \nmillion in CBT proceeds is collected) that are used to defray Club  \nfunding obligations arising from the Players Benefit Plan shall be  \ndeducted from Players Benefit Plan Costs. In no event shall this  \ndeduction exceed $13 million in aggregate for the 30 Clubs in  \nany Contract Year.  \nFor the 2017 Contract Year, the Clubs\u2019 costs under paragraphs  \n(b) through (g) above shall be $219,300,000 ($7,310,000 per  \nClub).  \n(2) Limitation on Annual Increase  \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, beginning with the increase from  \nthe 2017 to the 2018 Contract Year, the annual rate of increase for  \nthe Clubs\u2019 costs under paragraphs (b) through (g) above shall be the  \nhigher of 6.0% and the annual rate of increase over that year in the  \ncombined \u201csum of the yearly Salaries\u201d (described in Section C(1)(b)  \nabove) for all Clubs.  \nE. Determination of Salary  \nThe determination of a Player\u2019s Salary for a particular Contract Year  \nfor the purposes of interpretation and application of this Article XXIII  \nonly shall be in accordance with the following rules.  \n(1) General Rule  \n\u201cSalary\u201d shall mean the value of the total compensation (cash or  \notherwise) paid to a Player pursuant to the terms of a Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract, including any guarantee by the Club of payments  \nby third parties, for a particular championship season. Salary shall  \ninclude, without limitation, the value of non-cash compensation such  \nas the provision of personal translators, personal massage therapists,  \nand airfare and tickets exceeding normal Club allotments. Consistent  \nwith the rules set out below, all compensation paid to a Player pur-  \nsuant to the terms of a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract shall be attributa-  \n117  \nble to the Contract Year(s) in which the Player is required under the  \nContract to render services to a Club as a baseball player, regardless  \nof how the compensation is characterized under the Contract.  \n(2) Average Annual Value of Guaranteed Multi-Year Contracts  \nA Uniform Player\u2019s Contract with a term of more than one (1)  \nchampionship season (\u201cMulti-Year Contract\u2019) shall be deemed to  \nhave a Salary in each Guaranteed Year equal to the \u201cAverage Annual  \nValue\u201d (\u201cAAV\u201d) of the Contract (plus any bonuses subsequently  \nincluded by operation of Section E(4) below). The AAV shall be cal-  \nculated as follows: the sum of (a) the Base Salary in each Guaran-  \nteed Year plus (b) any portion of a Signing Bonus (or any other  \npayment that this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) attributed to  \na Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(3) below plus (c)  \nany deferred compensation or annuity compensation costs attributed  \nto a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(6) below shall  \nbe divided by the number of Guaranteed Years. Notwithstanding the  \nforegoing, if a Multi-Year Contract is signed after Opening Day of  \nthe championship season, the: (1) Base Salary in the first Guaranteed  \nYear for purposes of the AAV calculation shall be determined by  \nmultiplying that Base Salary by a fraction, the numerator of which  \nshall be the number of championship season days that the Player  \nwas paid the Base Salary, and the denominator shall be the number  \nof championship season days in that championship season; and (11)  \nthe first Guaranteed Year shall not be considered a full Guaranteed  \nYear for purposes of the AAV calculation, but shall be considered a  \npartial year equal to the fraction described in subsection (1) above.  \n(3) Signing Bonuses  \nAny Signing Bonus in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract (and any  \nother payment this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) shall be  \nattributed, pro rata, over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract. If a  \nContract contains no Guaranteed Years, the Signing Bonus shall be  \nattributed in full to the first year of the Contract.  \n(4) Performance, Award and Other Bonuses  \n(a) Any amounts that are actually earned by a Player as Perfor-  \nmance Bonuses, Award Bonuses or any other bonuses properly  \nincluded in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract shall be included as part of  \n118  \nthe Player\u2019s Salary in the Contract Year in which the service or per-  \nformance giving rise to the Bonus was provided. Potential bonuses  \nshall not be included in the AAV calculation made pursuant to Sec-  \ntion E(2) above.  \n(b) A Special Covenant in a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract that pro-  \nvides that Player performance or achievement in one year of the  \nContract will increase the Base Salary in other year(s) of the Con-  \ntract shall not be considered in the determination of Salary until the  \ntriggering event occurs (other than, if applicable, as a \u201cpotential  \nbonus\u2019\u2019), unless it is determined by the Arbitration Panel that the  \nSpecial Covenant was designed to defeat or circumvent the inten-  \ntion of the Parties as reflected in this Article XXIII. As long as such  \na finding is not made, the additional Base Salary triggered by the  \nSpecial Covenant shall count as part of the Player\u2019s Salary in the  \nContract Year(s) to which it is attributed by the Contract once the  \ntriggering event has occurred. Multi-Year Contracts shall not be  \nrecalculated on an AAV basis once the triggering event has  \noccurred; the additional Base Salary shall be added to the Salary as  \noriginally calculated for the Contract Year in question.  \n(5) Option Contracts  \n(a) Definitions  \n(i) A \u201cClub Option Year\u201d shall mean a championship season  \ncovered by a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract in which the amount  \npayable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  \nguaranteed at the election of the Club or by reason of specified  \nperformance by a Player. Club Option Years shall not be consid-  \nered \u201cGuaranteed Years.\u201d In addition, any other championship  \nseason included in a Multi-Year Contract that is not a Guaranteed  \nYear shall be treated as a Club Option Year.  \n(11) A \u201cPlayer Option Year\u201d shall mean a championship season  \ncovered by a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract: (A) in which the amount  \npayable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  \nguaranteed at the election of the Player; or (B) that can be nulli-  \nfied by a Player for a reason other than those set forth in para-  \ngraph 7 of the Contract. A Player Option Year shall be considered  \na \u201cGuaranteed Year\u201d if, pursuant to the Player\u2019s right to elect or  \nsubject to his right to nullify, the terms of that year are guaran-  \n119  \nteed within the definition in Section A(8); provided, however,  \nthat a Player Option Year shall not be considered a Guaranteed  \nYear if the payment the Player 1s to receive if he declines to exer-  \ncise his option or nullifies the championship season is more than  \n50% of the Base Salary payable for that championship season. In  \nthe event that the Player has the right to exercise or nullify mul-  \ntiple Contract Years at one time (\u201cPlayer Opt-Out\u2019), the Contract  \nYears following the Player Opt-Out shall be considered Guaran-  \nteed Years; provided however, that the Contract Years following  \nthe Player Opt-Out shall not be considered Guaranteed Years if  \nthe payment the Player is to receive if he opts out of the Contract  \nis more than 50% of the sum of the Base Salaries in the Contract  \nYears following the Player Opt-Out.  \n(111) A \u201cDual Option Year\u201d shall mean a championship season  \ncovered by a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract in which the amount  \npayable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  \nguaranteed at the election of either the Player or the Club. Salaries  \nunder any such Contract shall be calculated as if the Dual Option  \nYear is a Player Option Year.  \n(iv) A \u201cMutual Option Year\u2019 shall mean a championship sea-  \nson covered by a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract in which the amount  \npayable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  \nguaranteed only upon the election of both the Player and the Club.  \nSalaries under any such Contract shall be calculated as if the  \nMutual Option Year is a Club Option Year.  \n(b) Option Buyouts  \n(1) General Rule  \n(A) Ifa Uniform Player\u2019s Contract contains a Club Option  \nYear or a Player Option Year that is not deemed a Guaranteed  \nYear pursuant to subparagraph (a)(11) above and the Player is  \nto receive consideration upon the non-exercise of that option  \nor the nullification of a championship season (\u201cOption Buy-  \nout\u2019), then such Option Buyout shall be deemed a Signing  \nBonus. If a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract contains an Option  \nBuyout for a Club decision not to exercise a Club Option Year  \nand an Option Buyout for a Player decision not to exercise a  \nPlayer Option Year (or to nullify a championship season) that  \n120  \nis deemed a Signing Bonus pursuant to this subparagraph  \n(b)(1), then the higher Option Buyout payment shall be deemed  \nthe Signing Bonus.  \n(B) If a Contract contains an Option Buyout relating to  \nmore than one Option Year, then only the Option Buyout that  \nrelates to the earliest Option Year in the Contract shall be  \ndeemed a Signing Bonus. If, however, the Player ultimately  \nreceives an Option Buyout that relates to an Option Year other  \nthan the earliest Option Year, that Option Buyout shall be  \nincluded in Salary in the Contract Year covered by the option  \nthat was not exercised.  \n(C) Ifa Contract contains an earned bonus that increases an  \nOption Buyout, the Bonus shall be included in the Salary  \nattributed to the Contract Year immediately preceding the rel-  \nevant Option Year.  \n(11) Potential Adjustment to Payroll  \nNotwithstanding subparagraph (b)(i) above, if the Player  \nultimately does not receive the Option Buyout, then for the  \nContract Year covered by that option, no portion of the Buyout  \nshall be included in any Club\u2019s final Actual Club Payroll. In  \naddition, any Club whose final Actual Club Payroll in a previ-  \nous Contract Year had included that Buyout (or a portion  \nthereof) will receive a deduction (in the full amount of the  \nBuyout included in previous Contract Years) in its final Actual  \nClub Payroll in the Contract Year covered by that option.  \n(c) Club Option Years  \nIfa Uniform Player\u2019s Contract covers one or more seasons that  \nare Club Option Years, the Player\u2019s Salary for the championship  \nseasons that are Club Option Years, if exercised, shall be the total  \nof the Base Salary and any bonuses included by operation of Sec-  \ntion E(4) above.  \n(d) Player Option Years  \n(i) If a Player fails to exercise or chooses to nullify a Player  \nOption Year that is deemed a Guaranteed Year pursuant to Sec-  \ntion E(5)(a)(i1) above, the difference between the amount paid to  \nthe Player under his Contract (including any Option Buyout pay-  \n12]  \nment) and the amount that has been attributed to Actual Club  \nPayroll of a Club under that Contract shall be added to (or sub-  \ntracted from) Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year in which  \nthe Player Option Year falls. If the Contract has been assigned,  \nthe adjustment called for in the preceding sentence shall be made  \nto the Actual Club Payroll(s) of the Club(s) to which Salary  \nunder that Contract had been attributed in any Contract Year. If  \na Player exercises or fails to nullify a Player Option Year that  \nwas not deemed a Guaranteed Year, the Player\u2019s Salary in the  \nPlayer Option Year shall be the difference between the Salary  \nprovided in the Player Option Year (including any earned  \nbonuses) and the Option Buyout that had been attributed, in all  \nprevious Contract Years, to a Club pursuant to Section E(5)(b)()  \nabove.  \n(11) If the Base Salary (plus any deferred compensation or  \nannuity costs) in a Player Option Year (\u201cPlayer Option Year  \nValue\u2019\u2019) is less than 80% of the Base Salary (plus any attributed  \nSigning Bonus, deferred compensation or annuity costs) in the  \nGuaranteed Year with the smallest such figure before the first  \nsuch Player Option Year (80% Figure), then, for each such Player  \nOption Year, the difference between the Player Option Year Value  \nand the 80% Figure shall be allocated pro rata across the Guaran-  \nteed Years preceding the first such Player Option Year; provided,  \nhowever, that if the 80% Figure is itself less than 75% of the AAV  \nof the Contract (calculated as if the Player Option Year was not a  \nGuaranteed Year), then the 80% Figure shall instead be 75% of  \nthe AAV calculation set out immediately above.  \n(6) Deferred Compensation  \n(a) Definition  \n\u201cDeferred Compensation\u201d shall mean any Salary payable to a  \nPlayer pursuant to a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract in a Contract Year  \nafter the last championship season for which the Contract  \nrequires services as a baseball player to be rendered.  \n(b) Attribution  \n(1) Deferred Compensation shall be included in a Player\u2019s  \nSalary as if paid in the championship season to which it 1s attrib-  \nuted under a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract. If a Contract does not  \n122  \nattribute Deferred Compensation, the Contract shall be treated as  \nif the Deferred Compensation was attributed equally to each of  \nthe Guaranteed Years in the Contract.  \n(11) If the Deferred Compensation is to be paid with interest at  \nan effective rate that 1s within one and one-half percentage points  \nof the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year cov-  \nered by the Contract, then the Deferred Compensation shall be  \nincluded at its stated value. Otherwise, the Deferred Compensa-  \ntion shall be included at its present value in the season to which  \nit is attributed, said present value to be calculated by increasing  \nany such payments by the Contract\u2019s stated interest rate, if any,  \nand then reducing such payments back to their present value by  \napplying as a discount rate the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the  \nfirst Contract Year covered by the Contract. If the terms of a Con-  \ntract are confirmed by the Association and the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner before the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first  \nContract Year covered by the contract is available, the Imputed  \nLoan Interest Rate shall be the annual \u201cFederal mid-term rate\u201d as  \ndefined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the  \nmonth preceding the month in which terms are confirmed. If a  \nUniform Player\u2019s Contract uses the date or year in which a Player  \nretires as a triggering event for the commencement of payment of  \nthe Deferred Compensation, it will be assumed for purposes of  \ncalculating Salary under this Article only that the Player retires  \non the day that he reaches age 40 or at the end of the Contract,  \nwhichever is later.  \n(c) An \u201cAnnuity Compensation Arrangement\u201d is an agreement  \nin a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract whereby the Club promises to pur-  \nchase an annuity to pay the Player after he is no longer required to  \nrender services as a baseball player under such Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract.  \n(1) The portion of the cost of the annuity to be paid by the  \nClub while the Player is required to render services as a baseball  \nplayer under the Contract shall be included as Salary for the Con-  \ntract Year in which such cost is to be paid.  \n(11) The portion of the cost of the annuity instrument to be  \npaid by the Club after the Player is no longer required to render  \nservices as a baseball player under such Contract, if any, shall be  \n123  \ntreated as Deferred Compensation attributable pro rata over the  \nGuaranteed Years of the Contract at its present value as calcu-  \nlated pursuant to paragraph (6)(b) above. Any compensation that  \nthe Player is scheduled to receive pursuant to such Annuity Com-  \npensation Arrangement shall not be considered Salary or  \nDeferred Compensation.  \n(7) Loans to Players  \nFor purposes of this Article XXIII, the following rules shall apply  \nto any loans made by a Club to or at the direction of a Player.  \n(a) If any such loan bears no interest rate or an effective inter-  \nest rate more than one and one-half percentage points below the  \nImputed Loan Interest Rate, then an amount of \u201cImputed  \nIncome\u201d as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b) below shall  \nbe included in the Player\u2019s Salary for each Contract Year that the  \nloan remains unpaid. For any other loan, there shall be no  \n\u2018\u201cImputed Income\u201d (as defined in subparagraph (b) below)  \nincluded in the Player\u2019s Salary.  \n(b) \u201cImputed Income\u201d for each Contract Year covered by a  \nUniform Player\u2019s Contract shall be calculated by multiplying the  \ndifference between the Imputed Loan Interest Rate and the stated  \nrate, if any, by the outstanding balance of the loan.  \n(c) If a Club has made a loan to a Player and forgives part or  \nall of the loan, the forgiven loan amount shall be counted as Salary  \nin the Contract Year in which the loan is forgiven; provided, how-  \never, that if a loan that 1s made after October 23, 2006 is forgiven  \nin a Contract Year in which there is no Competitive Balance Tax,  \nand if the Club forgiving the loan would have been assessed a  \nCompetitive Balance Tax for any Contract Year had the loan, by  \nitself or in combination with other loans, been considered Salary  \nfrom the outset, then the forgiveness of the loan shall be presumed  \nto be an action designed to defeat or circumvent the Competitive  \nBalance Tax. Unless the Club that forgave such a loan can rebut  \nthe foregoing presumption, the Club shall be required to pay into  \nthe Central Fund an amount equal to the Competitive Balance  \nTax(es) that the Club would have paid (based on the Tax Thresh-  \nolds that were in effect when final Actual Club Payrolls were cal-  \n124  \nculated for the Contract Year(s) in which a Competitive Balance  \nTax would have been paid) had the forgiven loan (or portion  \nthereof) originally been considered Salary.  \nF. Association\u2019s Rights  \n(1) Actual Club Payroll Information  \n(a) In each Contract Year in which the Competitive Balance Tax  \nis operational, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide the  \nAssociation with two \u201cPreliminary Actual Club Payroll Compila-  \ntions,\u201d the first of which shall be provided within 14 days following  \nOpening Day of that championship season and the second of which  \nshall be provided within 14 days following that season\u2019s All-Star  \nGame. Each Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilation shall  \nconsist of a list of each Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll, broken down by  \nPlayer, and an estimate of Player Benefit Costs for that Contract  \nYear, as of Opening Day and the All-Star Game, respectively. In  \naddition to the above, the Association may, from time to time,  \nrequest the Office of the Commissioner to produce a Preliminary  \nActual Club Payroll Compilation or any portion thereof (including  \nthe Office of the Commissioner evaluation of any Uniform Player\u2019s  \nContract, the terms of which have been confirmed by the Associa-  \ntion and the Office of the Commissioner) and the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner shall provide such information within 14 days of each  \nsuch request, provided that the Association will not make an unrea-  \nsonable number of requests in any Contract Year.  \n(b) Upon the presentation of any evidence that a Player and a  \nClub are prepared to agree to a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract, either  \nParty to this Agreement (1.e., the Association or Office of the Com-  \nmissioner) may initiate a process whereby the Parties prepare and  \nexchange evaluations of that prospective Contract for Competitive  \nBalance Tax purposes. The evaluations shall be exchanged within  \n48 hours of the initiation of the process by either Party.  \n(c) The Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Association  \nwith a list of the final Actual Club Payrolls, broken down by Player,  \nand Player Benefit Costs for that Contract Year and the Competitive  \nBalance Tax assessed against each Club (\u201cfinal Actual Club Payroll  \nCompilation\u2019), if any, for the just completed championship season  \n125  \non or before the December 2 following each championship season  \ncovered by this Agreement in which the Competitive Balance Tax is  \napplicable.  \n(2) Associations Rights to Challenge  \n(a) Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(1)(a)  \nThe Association shall have the right to question any calculation  \nincluded in any information provided pursuant to Section F(1)(a)  \nabove and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer  \nto any such question within 10 days. If thereafter the Association  \ndisagrees with any calculation, it may file a challenge in the Griev-  \nance Procedure in Article XI at any time before the next November  \n30. At the request of either Party, any such Grievance shall be han-  \ndled on an expedited basis, with documents being exchanged within  \n10 days of the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within  \n15 days of the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an  \nAward (with opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days  \nafter the commencement of the hearing. Failure by the Association  \nto challenge any such calculation shall not preclude the Association  \nfrom challenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club  \nPayroll Compilation nor shall such failure be of any relevance in  \nsuch a challenge.  \n(b) Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(1)(b)  \nThe Association shall have the right to question any calculation  \nincluded in any information exchanged pursuant to Section F(1)(b)  \nabove and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer  \nto any such question within 24 hours. If thereafter the Association  \ndisagrees with the calculation put forward by the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner, it may file a challenge in the Grievance Procedure in  \nArticle XI within three business days. Any such Grievance shall be  \nhandled on an expedited basis, with documents being exchanged as  \nsoon as possible, a hearing commencing within three business days  \nof the filing of the Grievance (or as soon thereafter as 1s practicable)  \nand the Panel issuing an Award (with opinion to follow, if neces-  \nsary) no later than three business days after the commencement of  \nthe hearing. Failure by the Association to challenge any such calcu-  \nlation shall not preclude the Association from challenging that cal-  \n126  \nculation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation, nor  \nshall such failure be of any relevance in such a challenge. Failure by  \nthe Office of the Commissioner to raise or pursue with the Arbitra-  \ntion Panel any disagreement with the Association concerning infor-  \nmation exchanged pursuant to Section F(1)(b) above shall be  \nirrelevant to any challenge by the Association to any calculation.  \n(c) Information Provided Pursuant to Section FC )(c)  \nThe Association may challenge any calculation included in infor-  \nmation provided pursuant to Section F(1)(c) (the final Actual Club  \nPayroll Compilation) by filing a Grievance pursuant to Article XI.  \nIf the Association disagrees with any calculation that affects the  \nCompetitive Balance Taxes assessed for that Contract Year, it shall  \nfile a Grievance within 45 days after it has received that Year\u2019s final  \nActual Club Payroll Compilation and the notice of assessed Com-  \npetitive Balance Taxes (see Section B(6)(a)). Failure by the Associ-  \nation to challenge any calculation included in a final Actual Club  \nPayroll Compilation shall not preclude the Association from chal-  \nlenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll  \nCompilation for a later Contract Year, nor shall such failure be of  \nany relevance in such a challenge. Such a challenge, however, will  \nnot result in changes to Competitive Balance Tax amounts assessed  \nfor prior Contract Years. Any Grievance challenging a final Actual  \nClub Payroll Compilation shall be handled by the Parties on an  \nexpedited basis with documents being exchanged within 10 days of  \nthe filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of  \nthe filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with  \nopinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days after the com-  \nmencement of the hearing. The filing of a Grievance by the Associ-  \nation shall not preclude the Office of the Commissioner from  \nassessing and collecting the Competitive Balance Tax in accordance  \nwith Section B and using Competitive Balance Tax proceeds in  \naccordance with Section H, unless the Chair of the Arbitration  \nPanel, upon application by the Association, provides otherwise.  \nUnless the Chair provides otherwise, any adjustments to the Com-  \npetitive Balance Tax assessments and distributions made pursuant to  \nthis Section F necessitated by the resolution of an Association  \nGrievance shall be made by the Office of the Commissioner once  \nthe Grievance 1s finally resolved.  \n127  \n(d) Relationship to Grievance Procedure  \n(1) Nothing in this Section F is intended to affect the applica-  \ntion of the Grievance Procedure to any other complaint involv-  \ning the existence or interpretation of, or compliance with, this  \nArticle XXIII or any provision therein. Moreover, unless specif-  \nically modified by this Section F, it is intended that the provi-  \nsions of Article XI will govern the resolution of disputes under  \n"], ["this Article XXIII.  \n", "(11) It is agreed that the existence of the expedited procedures  \nin this Section F will not prohibit either Party from arguing that  \nanother dispute subject to Article XI should be heard prior to any  \ndispute related to this Article X XIII.  \nG. Other Undertakings  \n(1) Neither the Parties hereto nor any Club or any Player shall  \nenter into any agreement, Uniform Player\u2019s Contract or other trans-  \naction, that includes any terms designed to defeat or circumvent the  \nintention of the Parties as reflected by this Article XXIII.  \n(2) At the time a Club and a Player enter into any Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract, or at the time of the assignment of any Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract, there shall be no unreported understandings or  \nagreements of any kind between the Player and the Club. No other  \nunderstandings or agreements, whether made before or after the  \nsigning of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract or its assignment, shall be  \nvalid, recognizable or of any effect whatsoever, unless expressly set  \nforth in a new or supplemental Uniform Player\u2019s Contract executed  \nby the Player and the Club and complying with this Agreement and  \nthe Major League Rules.

If a new  \nContract is signed during a championship season to commence  \nwith the next championship season, the calculation called for in  \nthis paragraph (3) shall be performed at the end of the then cur-  \nrent championship season. Except for the limited circumstances  \ndescribed in this paragraph (3), no Player may be signatory to  \nmore than one unexpired Uniform Player\u2019s Contract at any time.  \nUses of Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  \nCompetitive Balance Tax proceeds collected pursuant to Section B(6)  \nabove shall be used as follows.

Clubs\u2019 Trans-  \n132  \nfer Percentages will be determined for each Revenue Sharing  \nYear pursuant to the formula in this Section A(10).  \n(c) For each Revenue Sharing Year, a Club\u2019s Transfer Percent-  \nage as calculated above shall be multiplied by the Net Transfer  \nValue of the Plan for that Revenue Sharing Year as described in  \nSection A(9) above to determine the Club\u2019s payment or receipt  \nfor that Year.

The  \nCommissioner may make distributions from the Commissioner\u2019s  \nDiscretionary Fund to a Club or Clubs, in amounts and at times to  \nbe determined at the Commissioner\u2019s discretion, subject to the fol-  \nlowing guidelines and procedures.  \n(a) Guidelines. The Commissioner, in exercising this discre-  \ntion, shall take no action that is inconsistent with this Agreement.  \nBy way of example, but not limitation, the Commissioner may  \nnot consider: (1) positions that a Club has taken with respect to  \nany matter before the Clubs, the Executive Council or the Office  \nof the Commissioner; (11) a Club\u2019s contracting decisions with  \nrespect to or contemplated offers to free agents or free agent eli-  \ngible players; or (111) whether a Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll is or  \nhas been above the Competitive Balance Tax threshold estab-  \nlished in Article XXIII, above. In addition, the Commissioner  \nshall not, absent agreement of the Parties, distribute more than  \n133  \n$4 million to any individual Club in any Revenue Sharing Year  \nor make more than one distribution to any Club with a Market  \nScore of greater than 100 during the term of the Agreement.  \n(b) Procedures.  \n(1) Written Requests. Any Club seeking a distribution  \nfrom the Commissioner\u2019s Discretionary Fund shall submit a  \nrequest in writing to the Commissioner. The written request  \nmust include, but need not be limited to: (1) the amount  \nrequested; (11) the use(s) to which the Club intends to put the  \nrequested distribution; and (111) an explanation of how, in the  \nClub\u2019s view, the requested distribution should improve the  \nClub\u2019s performance on the field. The Commissioner shall  \nrespond in writing to each request for a distribution from the  \nCommissioner\u2019s Discretionary Fund.  \n(11) Consultation with the Association. The Commissioner  \nshall, within 30 days of receiving a request pursuant to sub-  \nparagraph (b)(1) above, provide to the Association a copy of  \nthe written request and his preliminary position on the request  \n(e.g., inclined to grant, might consider if modified, or not  \ninclined to grant). The Commissioner shall, at the Associa-  \ntion\u2019s request, consult with the Association prior to making  \nany distribution. At the Association\u2019s request, the Commis-  \nsioner shall also consult with the Association regarding a  \nrequest that he is not inclined to grant in its current form. The  \nCommissioner shall give notice to the Association at least 15  \ndays prior to making any distribution, unless such notice is not  \npossible under the circumstances. In such case, the Commis-  \nsioner shall provide as much notice to the Association as is  \npossible under these circumstances, but, in no event, shall any  \ndistribution be made without at least five (5) days\u2019 written  \nnotice to the Association. As part of any such consultation  \nprocess, the Commissioner shall provide the Association with  \nthe documents required to be produced pursuant to Section  \nD(2)(k) of this Article and any document reasonably requested  \nby the Association pursuant to Section D(2).  \nTiming of Distributions. The Commissioner shall  \nattempt to make distributions for a given Revenue Sharing  \nYear no later than December 1. The Commissioner may make  \n134  \ndistributions that are contingent on a Club\u2019s satisfaction of  \nspecified conditions and may carry over funds to the next Rev-  \nenue Sharing Year if the money is not distributed because the  \nconditions were not fulfilled.  \n(12) Clubs with a Market Score greater than 100, as reflected in  \nAttachment 26, shall be fully disqualified from receiving revenue  \nsharing in the 2017-21 Revenue Sharing Years, except as set forth in  \nSection A(11) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the revenue  \nsharing disqualification of the Oakland Athletics shall be phased in  \nas follows: 25% disqualified in the 2017 Revenue Sharing Year; 50%  \ndisqualified in the 2018 Revenue Sharing Year; 75% disqualified in  \nthe 2019 Revenue Sharing Year; and fully disqualified in the 2020  \nand 2021 Revenue Sharing Years. However, the Oakland Athletics  \nshall be considered a market-disqualified Club for purposes of sub-  \nparagraphs 12(a) and (b) below, beginning in 2017.  \n(a) Distribution of Market Disqualification Proceeds: Except  \nas provided by subparagraph 12(b) below, revenue sharing pro-  \nceeds forfeited by market-disqualified Clubs by operation of this  \nSection A(12) shall be refunded to Revenue Sharing Payor Clubs.  \nRevenue Sharing Payor Clubs shall receive a share of forfeited  \nproceeds in proportion to their paid share of the Net Transfer  \nValue for a given Revenue Sharing Year (referred to as the Club\u2019s  \n\u201cMarket Disqualification  \n(b) Forfeiture of Market Disqualification Refund: Notwith-  \nstanding subparagraph 12(a) above, a Revenue Sharing Payor  \nClub may forfeit some or all of its Market Disqualification Refund  \nin a Revenue Sharing Year if its Actual Club Payroll during the  \nsame Contract Year exceeds the Base Tax Threshold under Article  \nXXIII (\u201cCBT Payor Club\u2019\u2019). The percentage of the Market Dis-  \nqualification Refund that a CBT Payor Club shall forfeit, if any,  \nwill be determined by the number of consecutive Contract Years  \nthat it had been a CBT Payor Club, as set forth below and regard-  \nless of whether the consecutive Contract Years fell within the term  \nof this or the immediately preceding Basic Agreement. Revenue  \nSharing Payor Clubs shall receive their full Market Disqualifica-  \ntion Refund in any year in which they are not a CBT Payor Club  \neven if they were a CBT Payor Club in prior Contract Years.  \n135  \n(1) Tier 1: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall receive  \n100% of its Market Disqualification Refund if it is a CBT  \nPayor Club during the Contract Year at issue but was not a  \nCBT Payor Club in the immediately preceding Contract Year.  \n(11) Tier 2: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  \n25% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the Con-  \ntract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a second consec-  \nutive Contract Year.  \n(111) Tier 3: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  \n50% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the Con-  \ntract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a third consecu-  \ntive Contract Year.  \n(iv) Tier 4: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  \n75% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the Con-  \ntract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a fourth consec-  \nutive Contract Year.  \n(v) Tier 5: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  \n100% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the  \nContract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a fifth (or  \nmore) consecutive Contract Year.  \n(vi) Initial Assignment of Tier: For purposes of determin-  \ning a Club\u2019s Tier for the 2017 Revenue Sharing Year\u2014  \n(A) A Club that was not a 2016 CBT Payor Club is a  \nTier 1 Club if it is a CBT Payor Club in 2017.  \n(B) A Club that was not a 2015 CBT Payor Club but was  \na 2016 CBT Payor Club is a Tier 2 Club if it is a CBT Payor  \nClub in 2017.  \n(C) A Club that was a CBT Payor Club in 2016 for the  \nsecond consecutive Contract Year is a Tier 3 Club if itis a  \nCBT Payor Club in 2017.  \n(D) A Club that was a CBT Payor Club in 2016 for the  \nthird consecutive Contract Year is a Tier 4 Club if it is a  \nCBT Payor Club in 2017.  \n136  \n(E) A Club that was a CBT Payor Club in 2016 for the  \nfourth (or more) consecutive Contract Year is a Tier 5 Club  \nif 1t is a CBT Payor Club in 2017.  \n(vii) Subsequent Assignment of Tier:  \n(A) A Club will move up one Tier for each consecutive  \nContract Year it remains a CBT Payor Club.  \n(B) A Club that is a CBT Payor Club in a given Contract  \nYear but is not a CBT Payor Club for the next two or more  \nconsecutive Contract Years will be a Tier 1 Club in the next  \nContract Year in which it is a CBT Payor Club.  \n(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sub-  \nparagraphs b(1)-(v) above, a Club that is a CBT Payor Club  \nin a given Contract Year but is not a CBT Payor Club for  \nonly the next Contract Year will have its assigned Tier  \nreduced by two levels (but in no event to lower than Tier 1)  \nin the next Contract Year in which it is a CBT Payor Club.  \nFor example, a Club that is at Tier 5 entering the 2018 Rev-  \nenue Sharing Year but is not a CBT Payor Club in 2018 will  \nreceive its full Market Disqualification Refund in 2018, and  \nwill be a Tier 3 Club if it is a CBT Payor Club in 2019.  \n(viii) Distribution of Forfeited Refunds: Amounts for-  \nfeited in a given Revenue Sharing Year by operation of this  \nsubparagraph 12(b) shall be redistributed as follows.  \n(A) 50% of forfeited amounts shall be used to fund  \nbenefits to Players via the Major League Baseball Players  \nInvestment Plan.  \n(B) 50% of forfeited amounts shall be distributed  \nto Revenue Sharing Payee Clubs, excluding market-  \ndisqualified Clubs, that either are not CBT Payor Clubs in  \nthe given Contract Year or are CBT Payor Clubs in the  \ngiven Contract Year but were not CBT Payor Clubs in the  \nimmediately preceding Contract Year. Such distributions  \nshall be made to the qualifying Revenue Sharing Payee  \nClubs in proportion to the amount of revenue sharing pro-  \nceeds they received.  \n137  \n(13) The \u201cAdministrator\u201d shall be the representative (or repre-  \nsentatives) responsible, in consultation with the Association, for  \nadministration of the Revenue Sharing Plan under this Article  \nXXIV. (See Section C, Administration, below.)  \nB. General Principles  \n(1) Intent of the Plan  \nThe intent of the Revenue Sharing Plan is to transfer among the  \nClubs in each Revenue Sharing Year the amount of revenue that  \nwould have been transferred in that Year by a 48% straight pool  \nplan, plus such transfers as may result from distributions of the  \nCommissioner\u2019s Discretionary Fund.  \n(2) Other Sharing  \nExcept as expressly provided for in the Basic Agreement or other  \nagreements between the Parties, nothing in this Article is intended  \nto alter current agreements among the Clubs pertaining to Central  \nRevenue, including but not limited to the Major League Central  \nFund, the Office of the Commissioner, Major League Baseball  \nProperties, Inc., Major League Baseball Advanced Media, L.P., The  \nMLB Network, LLC, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the  \nAll-Star Game, and national marketing and licensing. Notwithstand-  \ning the preceding sentence and except as expressly provided for in  \nthe Basic Agreement or other agreements between the Parties, the  \nOffice of the Commissioner shall take no action regarding the allo-  \ncation or distribution of Central Revenue that is (1) in response to  \nthe operation of the Revenue Sharing Plan or (11) inconsistent with  \nthe manner in which the Commissioner has allocated or distributed  \nCentral Revenue in the past.  \n(3) Accounting Rules  \nIn calculating net payments and net receipts, the Administrator,  \non behalf of the Clubs, shall use the definitions contained in the  \n2016 FIQ, subject to the provisions of Section C below. The inten-  \ntion is to continue to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Princi-  \nples (\u201cthe GAAP rules\u2019\u2019) in the adoption and application of revenue  \nand expense definitions contained in the FIQ and to use GAAP or,  \nin designated situations, federal tax principles, as the \u201cdefault\u201d stan-  \n138  \ndards in the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected  \nin the FIQ (and in any changes to any of the foregoing). It is  \nacknowledged, however, that specific exceptions to the GAAP rules  \nhave been and will be warranted to ensure uniformity, consistency  \nand fair treatment among the Clubs, subject to the provisions of Sec-  \ntion C, below.  \n(4) Interests of the Association  \nThe Revenue Sharing Plan may have a significant impact on the  \nindustry globally as well as on individual Clubs. Accordingly, the  \nParties acknowledge that the Association has a significant interest in  \nany aspect of any of the components of the Revenue Sharing Plan  \nor its operation materially affecting either: (a) the overall industry-  \nwide transfer of revenue among Clubs; or (b) the amounts of pay-  \nments made by individual Clubs and the amounts of receipts  \nreceived by individual Clubs. This paragraph shall not be construed  \nto limit the Association\u2019s right to assert that it has other legitimate  \ninterests in the operation of the Plan.  \n(5) Other Undertakings  \n(a) A principal objective of the Revenue Sharing Plan is to pro-  \nmote the growth of the Game and the industry on an individual Club  \nand on an aggregate basis. Accordingly, each Club shall use its rev-  \nenue sharing receipts (including any distributions from the Commis-  \nsioner\u2019s Discretionary Fund) in an effort to improve its performance  \non the field. The following uses of revenue sharing receipts are not  \nconsistent with a Club\u2019s obligation under this paragraph 5(a) to use  \nsuch receipts in an effort to improve its performance on the field:  \npayments to service acquisition debt or any other debt that is unre-  \nlated to past or future efforts to improve performance on the field;  \npayments to individuals other than on-field personnel or personnel  \nrelated to player development; payments to entities that do not have  \na direct role in improving on-field performance; and distributions to  \nownership that are not intended to offset tax obligations resulting  \nfrom Club operations. Consistent with his authority under the Major  \nLeague Constitution, the Commissioner may impose penalties on  \nany Club that fails to comply with this subparagraph 5(a). The Com-  \nmissioner, in addition to other penalties he may impose for violations  \nof any aspect of this subparagraph 5(a), may require a Club to sub-  \n139  \nmit a plan for its financial performance and competitive effort for the  \nnext two years. Such a plan must include a pro forma financial pres-  \nentation that specifies its attendance, revenues, payroll, player devel-  \nopment expenditures, non-player costs, and capital spending. The  \nCommissioner, after consultation with the Players Association, may  \ndirect the Club to change aspects of its plan, including the level of  \ncompetitive effort reflected in the plan, or take other actions as he  \nconsiders appropriate (including escrow of a portion of a Club\u2019s rev-  \nenue sharing payments).  \nThe Association has the burden in any proceeding under the Griev-  \nance Procedure of demonstrating that the Club\u2019s use of its revenue  \nsharing receipts was in violation of this subparagraph S(a). In any  \nsuch Grievance, the Arbitration Panel shall consider, among other  \nthings: (1) the Club\u2019s expenditures on scouting, player development,  \nand player payroll; (11) the Club\u2019s long-term strategy for improving  \ncompetitiveness; (111) the uses that the Club has historically made of  \nrevenue sharing receipts; and (iv) the overall financial position of the  \nClub. Notwithstanding the above, if a Club\u2019s Actual Club Payroll pur-  \nsuant to Article XXIII(C) is equal to less than 125% of its revenue  \nsharing receipts in a given Revenue Sharing Year, the Club shall have  \nthe burden of establishing in any Grievance that its use of revenue  \nsharing receipts was consistent with this subparagraph 5(a).  \n(b) Each Revenue Sharing Payee Club, no later than August 15,  \nshall report on the performance-related uses to which it put its rev-  \nenue sharing receipts in the current Revenue Sharing Year. That  \nreport shall include, in a single submission: a statement of the  \nClub\u2019s strategy for competitive improvement, aggregate revenues,  \npayroll, non-payroll costs, and operating profits, both planned and  \nactual, over the recent past and projected for at least two years; pro-  \nvided that the aforementioned financial data may be generated by  \nthe Office of the Commissioner for inclusion in the submission.  \n(c) The Clubs and the Association recognize that the participa-  \ntion of two Clubs is necessary for the production of the on-field  \ncompetition that the Clubs sell to the public. The net payments and  \nnet receipts required by this Article XXIV reflect a continuation of  \nthe amounts paid directly to the visiting Clubs and are in recogni-  \ntion of the principle that visiting Clubs should share, and in fact tra-  \n140  \nditionally have shared, in the economic benefits jointly generated by  \nthe Game at another Club\u2019s home field.  \n(d) None of the Parties hereto shall enter into any agreement, or  \nengage in any transaction or other conduct, designed to defeat or cir-  \ncumvent the intentions of the Parties as reflected in this Article  \nXXIV.  \nC. Administration  \n(1) Responsibility  \nThe administration of the Revenue Sharing Plan under this Arti-  \ncle XXIV shall be the responsibility of the Administrator in consul-  \ntation with the Association. The Administrator shall be the  \nCommissioner or, if so designated by the Major League Baseball  \nExecutive Council, a Committee of Clubs and/or representatives.  \nThe Administrator may delegate certain of his duties and responsi-  \nbilities to his staff and/or a committee of Club representatives  \nand/or expert consultants (e.g., the Revenue Sharing Definitions  \nCommittee), provided that the Administrator retains final decision-  \nmaking authority over all matters within his jurisdiction and subject  \nto the Players Association\u2019s rights (as set forth herein). The Office  \nof the Commissioner shall promptly notify the Association of a  \nchange in the Administrator.  \n(2) Duties of Administrator  \nThe Administrator shall have the following duties and responsi-  \nbilities, to be performed in consultation with the Association:  \n(a) Calculations and Determination of Payment Schedule.  \nThe Administrator shall calculate and determine the timing of  \npayment and distribution of net payments and net receipts by (or  \nto) Clubs. In this regard, the Administrator is authorized to  \nrequire estimated partial payments and distributions during the  \ncourse of a Revenue Sharing Year and to assess reasonable penal-  \nties for intentionally inaccurate estimates by Clubs. Unless  \naltered by the Administrator in consultation with the Association,  \nthe Clubs shall make payments to the Administrator in each year  \nof the Revenue Sharing Plan under the following schedule:  \n14]  \nDistribution  \nPayment Date Date Amount of Payment  \n25% of Estimated Annual  \n25% of Estimated Annual  \n25% of Estimated Annual  \nSeptember 15 |September 25 Met Payment  \nimated A l  \nPayment 4 November 15 | November 25 2574 of Estimated  \nNet Payment  \nFinal determination of  \nPayment 5 aie oe r) soit Annual Net Payment based  \nyea Onowing \u00a5 on Audited Results  \n(1) For Payments 1 \u2014 4, payment amounts shall be deter-  \nmined using the most recent Net Local Revenue estimates pro-  \nvided by Clubs as of October 25 of the previous year.  \n(11) The \u201cPayment Date\u201d shall be the date on which the  \nRevenue Sharing Payor Clubs pay estimated amounts to the  \nAdministrator based on an updated revenue sharing calcula-  \ntion provided to the Clubs.  \n(111) The \u201cDistribution Date\u201d shall be the latest date by  \nwhich the Administrator should distribute estimated amounts  \nto Revenue Sharing Payee Clubs based on the updated revenue  \nsharing calculation.  \n(iv) The \u201cEstimated Annual Net Payment\u201d shall include  \nany Market Disqualification Refunds distributed pursuant to  \nSection A(12)(a) above, but shall not account for any Market  \nDisqualification Refunds forfeited pursuant to Section  \nA(12)(b).  \n(v) The \u201cFinal Determination of Annual Net Payment  \nBased on Audited Results\u201d shall include any forfeited Market  \nDisqualification Refunds.  \n   \nIn determining whether to alter the foregoing schedule, the  \nAdministrator shall accord substantial weight to the cash flow  \nneeds under this Agreement of the industry as a whole, as  \nopposed to any specific Club. The Administrator shall also pro-  \nvide the Association with notice of any inter-Club disputes relat-  \n142  \ning to the payment and distribution of net payments and receipts  \nand the resolution of such disputes.  \nThe Commissioner\u2019s Discretionary Fund shall operate as pro-  \nvided in Section A(11), above.  \n(b) Review of Accounting and Reporting Practices. The  \nAdministrator shall review the accounting and reporting practices of  \nthe Clubs, as reflected in Club financial information submitted in  \nconnection with the FIQs, audited financial statements, and any  \nSIQs or supplemental information required by the Administrator to  \nbe submitted by Clubs. The Administrator shall also conduct regu-  \nlar full independent audits of the Clubs and of particular significant  \ntransactions (e.g., related party transactions). The Administrator will  \ncontinue to conduct full compliance audits of each Club in each year  \nof this Agreement. The Administrator is also authorized to make  \nappropriate changes, in furtherance of the objectives described  \nbelow in Section C(2)(c), in the definitions, accounting conven-  \ntions, policies or practices reflected in the FIQ, subject to prior  \nnotice to, and consultation with, the Association. The Administrator  \nis also authorized to require a more detailed Club submission of line  \nitems as set out in the FIQ.  \n(c) Objectives. In performing functions under this paragraph  \n(2), the objectives of the Administrator are:  \n(1) to achieve uniformity and consistency in reporting  \namong Clubs;  \n(11) to achieve uniformity and consistency in reporting from  \nRevenue Sharing Year to Revenue Sharing Year;  \n(111) to accord fair treatment in the calculation of net pay-  \nments and net receipts;  \n(iv) to be fair, impartial and objective in assessing and eval-  \nuating new issues that arise in the operation of the Plan; and  \n(v) to remain faithful to the agreement of the Parties  \nreflected in this Article XXIV.  \n(3) Specific Prohibition  \nIn performing duties and responsibilities in the administration of  \nthe Revenue Sharing Plan, the Administrator shall not materially  \n143  \naffect the agreement of the Parties as reflected in this Article,  \nincluding, but not limited to:  \n(a) the industry-wide net transfer of Net Local Revenue  \namong Clubs;  \n(b) the amounts of contributions made by individual Revenue  \nSharing Payor Clubs and the amounts of payments received by  \nindividual Revenue Sharing Payee Clubs; or  \n(c) the amounts distributed under the Commissioner\u2019s Discre-  \ntionary Fund.  \nD. Participation of the Association  \n(1) Consultation  \n(a) Within 30 days following execution of this Agreement, the  \nAdministrator shall promptly notify and consult with the Association  \nin advance with regard to any proposed action the Administrator  \nintends to take pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2)(a) and (2)(b) of Section  \nC above in connection with the administration of the Revenue Shar-  \ning Plan. The Administrator and the Association shall thereafter meet  \nregularly on a monthly basis to facilitate administration of the Plan.  \nFurther, the Administrator shall regularly notify and consult with the  \nAssociation with respect to any proposed changes described in Sec-  \ntion C(2)(b), or any other proposed changes in the administration of  \nthe Plan, preliminary and final estimated partial payment calcula-  \ntions and preliminary and final calculations regarding net payments  \nor net receipts due under any component of the Plan.  \n(b) Failure by the Association to challenge at the consultation  \nstage with the Administrator or under the Grievance Procedure in  \nArticle XI any such proposed actions, changes, or preliminary esti-  \nmated partial payment calculations or preliminary calculations  \nregarding net payments or net receipts described above in Section  \nD(1)(a) shall not preclude the Association from challenging under  \nthe Grievance Procedure in Article XI any action taken, changes  \nmade, or final estimated partial payment calculations or final calcu-  \nlations regarding net payments or net receipts made by the Admin-  \nistrator in connection with the administration of the Revenue  \nSharing Plan. Further, nothing in this Article, including, but not lim-  \n144  \nited to, the consultation rights accorded the Association, is intended  \nto limit either the substantive rights of the Association under this  \nArticle or the application of the Grievance Procedure in Article XI  \nas to any complaint involving the existence or interpretation of, or  \ncompliance with, this Article or any provision herein.  \n(c) The filing of a Grievance under Article XI by the Association  \nshall not preclude the Administrator from calculating, collecting or  \nredistributing estimated partial payments or receipts or final net  \npayments or receipts in accordance with this Article, unless the  \nChair of the Arbitration Panel, upon application by the Association,  \nprovides otherwise. Unless the Chair provides otherwise, any  \nadjustments to the calculation, collection or redistribution of esti-  \nmated partial payments or receipts or of final net payments or  \nreceipts pursuant to this Article necessitated by the resolution of an  \nAssociation Grievance shall be made by the Administrator once the  \nGrievance is finally resolved.  \n(2) Right to Information  \nThe Administrator shall provide to the Association, upon request,  \nany relevant information necessary to the Association\u2019s perform-  \nance of its functions under this Article as collective bargaining rep-  \nresentative. More specifically, and not by way of limitation, the  \nAdministrator shall promptly provide to the Association on a regu-  \nlar basis for each Revenue Sharing Year of this Agreement, copies  \nof the following documents (in hard copy and computer readable  \nform, if available) within 10 days following preparation by or  \nreceipt by the Administrator of such data, except that (1) copies of  \ndocuments responsive to subparagraph (k) shall be provided with  \nthe notice provided pursuant to Section A(11)(b)(11) of this Article;  \n(11) copies of documents responsive to subparagraphs (e), (n) and (p)  \nshall be provided within 30 days following preparation of such data  \nby the Clubs (or the Administrator); and, if requested, (111) copies of  \ndocuments responsive to subparagraph (m) shall be provided within  \n10 days following the Association\u2019s request, as the case may be:  \n(a) the form FIQ to be submitted by Clubs, together with any  \nform SIQ or other forms requiring the submission of supplemen-  \ntal information to the Administrator by Clubs;  \n145  \n(b) any proposed changes in the form FIQ, SIQ or other forms  \nto be submitted to the Administrator by the Clubs, together with  \nexplanatory reports, if any, regarding such proposed changes;  \n(c) completed FIQs, SIQs or other supplemental information  \nforms submitted to the Administrator by each Club;  \n(d) audited financial statements submitted by each Club;  \n(e) summaries of local media contracts (and/or of any other  \nindividual Club contracts) submitted by each Club to, or main-  \ntained under the supervision of, the Office of the Commissioner  \n(or the Administrator);  \n(f) any industry-wide compilation of revenue and expense  \ndata, whether broken out by individual Club or groups of Clubs;  \n(g) any completed forms submitted by the Clubs to the  \nAdministrator in connection with the preparation of estimates of  \nnet payments or net receipts under any component of the Plan;  \n(h) any preliminary estimated partial payment calculations or  \npreliminary calculations by the Administrator of net payments  \nand net receipts due under any component of the Plan;  \n(1) any document reflecting a distribution to a Club under any  \ncomponent of the Plan;  \n(j) any document prepared by or on behalf of the Administra-  \ntor in connection with a full or partial independent audit of any  \nClub conducted by or on behalf of the Administrator as described  \nin Section C(2)(b) and Section D(3)(a) of this Article;  \n(k) any correspondence to or from the Administrator or the  \nOffice of the Commissioner regarding a contemplated distribu-  \ntion, noticed pursuant to Section A(11)(b)(i1) of this Article,  \nincluding but not limited to the written request submitted pur-  \nsuant to subparagraph (b)(1) of that Section and any documents  \nconsidered by the Commissioner during his review of the request;  \n(1) reports filed with the Commissioner pursuant to Section  \nB(5)(b) of this Article and any correspondence from or to the  \nCommissioner relating to his enforcement of Section B(5)(a) of  \nthis Article;  \n146  \n(m) upon specific request by the Association, any unsuccess-  \nful request made pursuant to Section A(11)(b)(i) of this Article,  \nany correspondence responsive to such submission and any doc-  \nument that the Commissioner considered in connection with his  \nrejection of such request;  \n(n) upon specific request by the Association, any Club docu-  \nment(s) examined or required to be examined by or on behalf of  \nthe Administrator in connection with a full or partial independent  \naudit of any Club conducted by or on behalf of the Administrator  \nas described in Section C(2)(b) and Section D(3)(a) of this Article;  \n(0) any final calculations by the Administrator of estimated  \npartial payments, net payments and net receipts due under the  \nPlan; and  \n(p) upon specific request by the Association, a description of  \nthe methodologies, assumptions and procedures used by the  \nAdministrator to calculate and/or reconcile items reported in  \nClub FIQs and Club audited financial statements.  \nIn addition, the Administrator or his staff will notify the Associ-  \nation in advance of any ruling of the Revenue Sharing Definitions  \nCommittee and will meet with the Association, upon request, to dis-  \ncuss the rationale for the ruling.  \n(3) Right to Audit  \n(a) The Association shall have the right, at any time during this  \nAgreement, to require the Administrator to conduct a full or partial  \nindependent audit of any Club for a given Revenue Sharing Year or  \nof any particular transaction, regardless of whether such an audit  \nwould have been required by the Administrator under the proce-  \ndures referred to in Section C(2)(b) above. Further, should the Asso-  \nciation require such an audit, the Association shall also have the  \nright to require the Administrator to examine specified transactions,  \nrevenue and/or expense items, and/or to require reconciliation of the  \nClub\u2019s FIQ and audited financial statements in specified areas. The  \nAssociation also shall have the right to require the Administrator to  \nexamine specified Club document(s). The Administrator shall con-  \nduct the audit within a reasonable period of time from the date of a  \nwritten demand therefor by the Association. To the extent practica-  \n147  \nble, such audit will be conducted under the same procedures and  \nunder the same time schedule as other audits conducted by the  \nAdministrator in accordance with Section C(2)(b) above. All  \nexpenses for such audits shall be borne solely by the Administrator.  \n(b) Upon a showing of good cause and written notice to the  \nAdministrator, the Association shall have the right to conduct its own  \nfull or partial independent audit of any such Club or transaction. The  \nAdministrator shall promptly arrange the date for the Association\u2019s  \naudit, to be conducted within a reasonable period of time from the  \ndate of the Association\u2019s notice pursuant to this subparagraph.  \n(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section C(2)(b), Section  \nD(3)(a) and Section D(3)(b) above, and without regard to whether  \nthe Administrator has conducted an audit pursuant to Section  \nC(2)(b) or Section D(3)(a) of any Club (or Clubs), the Association,  \nupon written notice to the Administrator, shall have the right to con-  \nduct its own full or partial independent audit of six (6) Clubs per  \nyear for each Revenue Sharing Year.

The Administrator shall  \npromptly arrange the date for the Association\u2019s audit, to be con-  \nducted within a reasonable period of time from the date of the Asso-  \nciation\u2019s notice pursuant to this subparagraph.  \n(d) Any audits conducted by the Association pursuant to sub-  \nparagraphs (b) or (c) above, may be conducted by representatives of  \nthe Association\u2019s choice, including accountant(s) employed on the  \nAssociation\u2019s staff, so long as such representatives are working  \nunder the supervision of Certified Public Accountant(s) of the Asso-  \nciation\u2019s choice.  \n(e) The Association shall utilize the rights set forth in this para-  \ngraph (3) in good faith and only in furtherance of its interest in  \nensuring compliance with this Agreement. In no event will the  \nAssociation conduct an unreasonable number of its own audits for  \nany Revenue Sharing Year.  \n(4) Confidentiality  \nAny financial information obtained by the Association from  \nthe Clubs (or the Administrator) pursuant to this Article shall  \n148  \nbe subject to the Confidentiality Agreement appended hereto in  \nAttachment 14.  \nARTICLE XXV\u2014International Play  \nA.

Club Selection and Reimbursement for International  \nPlay Events  \n(1) Events in Mexico, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic.  \nFor each Spring Training or championship season Event in Mex-  \nico, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic, the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner shall notify the Association in writing which Clubs have  \nbeen selected to participate in the Event by no later than April 1 in  \nthe year preceding the Event.  \n(2) Championship Season Events in Asia or the United Kingdom.  \nAs early as March | two years prior to the staging of any  \nchampionship season Event in Asia or the United Kingdom, but no  \nlater than March | in the year preceding such an Event, the Office  \nof the Commissioner will provide the Association with a list of at  \nleast four Clubs that are interested in participating in the Event. The  \n150  \nAssociation will then survey the Players on those Clubs to deter-  \nmine their interest in participating in the Event. During this survey  \nand consultation period, Club personnel shall be prohibited from  \nlobbying or attempting to persuade or dissuade Players from partic-  \nipating in the Event. Within thirty days of receiving the list of poten-  \ntial Clubs from the Office of the Commissioner, the Association will  \nidentify from that list at least two Clubs from the same League that  \nthe Association approves for participation in the Event.

Promoter Selection and Logistics for International Play  \nEvents  \n(1) The Office of the Commissioner shall be responsible for  \nselecting and negotiating contracts with promoters for International  \nPlay Events. Such promoters, as well as any event staff that are not  \nfull-time MLB employees, shall be subject to the prior written  \napproval of the Association, which shall not be unreasonably with-  \nheld.  \n(2) The Office of the Commissioner shall consult with the Asso-  \nciation prior to entering into any contract that affects the terms and  \nconditions of Player participation in an Event (including travel,  \nhotel selection, promotional activities involving Players), and pro-  \nvide copies of all final agreements to the Association.

The Office of the Commissioner  \nand the Association will each designate a single point person to  \ncoordinate with one another in between these bi-monthly meetings.  \nF. Promotional Activity and International Ambassadors  \n(1) Promotional Activities  \n(a) No later than 90 days before each scheduled Event (or  \nsome other reasonable notice period to be agreed upon by the  \nParties), the Office of the Commissioner shall provide to the  \nAssociation a plan to promote the Event and related activities.  \n152  \n(b) Each Player who participates in an Event shall be encour-  \naged to promote the Event, including by participating in at least  \ntwo large-group activities and one smaller-group promotional  \nactivity. Media availability at the ballpark shall not be counted  \ntoward these promotional activities. No Player shall be required,  \nwithout his consent, to participate in any appearance or activity  \nto promote an Event sponsor or promoter.  \n(c) At least 60 days prior to each Event, the Association will  \nidentify a group of no less than four Players from each Club (not  \nincluding any International Ambassadors, as described below)  \nwho will engage in one group activity or appearance to promote  \nthe Event.  \n(d) Promoter agreements for Events shall include a provision  \nthat allows the Office of the Commissioner to request that a  \nPlayer make no more than one commercial appearance on behalf  \nof an Event sponsor or promoter at a time and place convenient  \nfor the Player, with a predetermined appearance fee of $5,000.  \nThe agreement shall include as many details as possible regard-  \ning expectations of the Player for the projected/anticipated pro-  \nmotional event(s), and make clear to the promoter that Player  \nparticipation in any commercially sponsored activity is voluntary.  \nIn addition, the Parties shall jointly discuss other voluntary com-  \nmercial opportunities for Players on behalf of Event sponsors or  \npromoters in connection with each Event.  \n(e) Any agreement on promotion will be circulated as soon as  \nreasonably practicable to the Association.  \n(f) The Association shall be a party to any promotional agree-  \nments with third parties (not the Event promoter) that contem-  \nplate the involvement of Players. If the Office of the  \nCommissioner or a Club is approached about such promotional  \narrangements (including through an Event promoter), it shall  \ndirect inquiries to the Association. The Association agrees not to  \nbe a party to promotional agreements with third parties to partic-  \nipate in events that are scheduled at the same time as promotional  \nactivities reasonably scheduled by the Event promoter that all or  \nsubstantially all Players are requested to attend.  \n(g) The Office of the Commissioner and the Association shall  \njointly discuss voluntary commercial opportunities for Players,  \n153  \nprovided that any voluntary opportunities are made clear in the  \npromoter agreement.  \n(2) International Ambassadors. For all Events, at least two  \nactive Players from each Club will be chosen by the Association as  \nInternational Ambassadors. International Ambassadors may be  \nasked to participate in promotional services in advance of an Event,  \nsuch as appearances, press conferences, sponsor events, and other  \nsimilar events. Player compensation will be provided in an amount  \nagreed upon by the Parties from the International Play Bank  \nAccount (see Attachment 51), subject to projected available funds.  \nG. Player Participation in Off-Season and Spring Training  \nEvents  \n(1) Player participation in off-season Events will be purely vol-  \nuntary; however, the Association will encourage Player participa-  \ntion in these Events.

Prouty, Esquire  \nGeneral Counsel  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nRe:  \nCharitable Contributions  \nDear David:  \nI am writing to confirm certain understandings we have reached with  \nrespect to special covenants in the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract (\u201cUPC\u201d)  \nthat provide for player contributions to charities that are affiliated with  \nthe Club.  \nPlayers and Clubs may only include special covenants in UPCs exe-  \ncuted after the date of this Agreement that require a Player to make a  \ncontribution to a Club\u2019s charitable foundation or charity if each of the  \nfollowing criteria 1s met:  \nI.  \nThe UPC is for a Player who has Major League service at or  \nabove the threshold for obtaining arbitration eligibility under Arti-  \ncle VI(E) in the prior season;  \nThe UPC is \u201cguaranteed\u201d and covers more than one season, not  \nincluding any option years;  \nThe special covenant provides for a maximum annual charitable  \ncontribution of 1% of the Player\u2019s annual salary or such other  \namount up to a maximum aggregate contribution over the term of  \nthe contract of 1% of the player\u2019s total guaranteed salary;  \nThe special covenant provides the Player with the option of fund-  \ning the contribution to the charitable foundation through a payroll  \ndeduction, personal check, or some other mutually acceptable  \npayment method;  \nThe special covenant provides that 50% of the annual Player con-  \ntribution be directed to the Club\u2019s charitable foundation for use at  \nthe foundation\u2019s discretion, and that the other 50% be directed to  \nthe Club\u2019s charitable foundation for distribution to charities to be  \nmutually agreed upon by the Player and the Club, with the under-  \n185  \nstanding that the majority of the latter contribution will be allo-  \ncated to charities within the metropolitan area of the Club absent  \nan agreement otherwise;  \n6. The special covenant, including any obligation on behalf of the  \nPlayer to make a charitable contribution that has not yet accrued,  \nwill have no force and effect if the Player\u2019s UPC 1s assigned to  \nanother Major League Club or if the Player is unconditionally  \nreleased; and  \n7. The charitable contribution special covenant(s) was negotiated on  \nan individual basis and is not part of an across-the-board Club or  \nCommissioner\u2019s Office policy requiring all eligible players to  \nmake charitable contributions.  \nA special covenant providing for a charitable contribution may be con-  \nsidered by the Arbitration Panel in any grievance involving a determi-  \nnation of whether a Player has complied with his obligations under  \nparagraph 3(b) of his UPC.  \nA Club will supply to any player who has made, or is scheduled to  \nmake, a contractually-required charitable contribution to a Club-spon-  \nsored foundation or charity, an annual accounting of the uses of his  \ncontributions and the most recent audit report for the foundation or  \ncharity.  \nWith respect to any Major League contracts that contain a charitable  \ncontribution provision and were signed prior to the effective date of the  \nnew Basic Agreement, the terms of the January 15, 2010 settlement  \nagreement shall continue to govern.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDaniel R.

Clark  \nExecutive Director  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nDear Tony:  \nThe Players Association has consistently maintained that a centralized  \neffort by the Office of the Commissioner and/or the Clubs to reduce the  \nnumber of Major League Clubs is a mandatory subject of bargaining  \nunder the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d\u2019). The Clubs, on the  \nother hand, have consistently taken the position that such action is a  \npermissive subject of bargaining under the NLRA. Without resolving  \nthis difference of opinion, the Parties have reached certain agreements  \non this topic during the negotiations over a successor Basic Agree-  \nment. Those agreements are reflected in Article XV(H) (Future Con-  \ntraction) of the new Basic Agreement. The Parties agree, by this letter,  \nthat their agreement on this topic and the bargaining that preceded it  \nshall not be used by either party as evidence that the topic is or is not  \na mandatory subject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, includ-  \ning any grievance or NLRB proceeding.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDaniel R. Halem  \nChief Legal Officer  \nMajor League Baseball  \nOffice of the Commissioner  \n187  \nATTACHMENT 9  \nTony C. Clark  \nExecutive Director  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nRe: Central Tender Letter  \nDear Tony:  \nPursuant to Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and paragraph 10(a)  \nof the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract (\u201c\u201cUPC\u2019\u2019), the Clubs hereby tender  \ncontracts to the following players for the term of the next year as  \nfollows:  \nCLUB  \nPlayer Name Salary For Major Performance Salary For Minor Other  \nLeague Service Bonuses League Service  \n[See Exhibit | hereto]  \nAccordingly, the following players have not been tendered contracts  \nfor the term of the next year:  \nCLUB  \nPlayer Name  \n[See Exhibit 2 hereto]  \nFinally, Exhibit 3 provides the addresses of the Players who were pro-  \nmoted to a Major League roster for the first time this November and of  \nthose Players who, according to our records, do not have a certified  \nPlayer Agent.  \nSincerely,  \nDaniel R. Halem  \nChief Legal Officer  \nMajor League Baseball  \nOffice of the Commissioner  \n188  \nATTACHMENT 10  \nThis will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding the last  \nparagraph of Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and, specifically,  \nthe exercise of free agency rights by Players on the Restricted, Sus-  \npended, Disqualified, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military Lists:  \n1. A Player who properly has been placed on the Restricted List,  \nor who properly has been placed on the Disqualified List for fail-  \nure to render his services to his Club, shall be eligible to become a  \nfree agent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set  \nforth therein. Upon becoming a free agent, such Player shall auto-  \nmatically be removed from the Restricted or Disqualified List and  \nreinstated to active status. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Player  \nwho properly has been placed on the Restricted List for a violation  \nof the Joint Drug Program or Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual  \nAssault and Child Abuse Policy shall be eligible to become a free  \nagent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set forth  \ntherein, but shall remain on the Restricted List until he completes  \nhis suspension.  \n2. A Player who properly has been placed on the Disqualified  \nList for a reason other than that stated in paragraph | above, or who  \nproperly has been placed on the Suspended, Ineligible, Voluntarily  \nRetired or Military List, shall also be eligible to become a free agent  \nas provided in Article XX, but he shall not be eligible to sign or play  \nwith a new Club until removed from such List and reinstated to  \nactive status.  \n189  \nATTACHMENT 11  \nThis will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding Article  \nXX(A) of the Basic Agreement and, specifically, the obligations of  \nClubs to tender Contracts to and renew Major League Contracts of  \nPlayers on the Restricted, Suspended, Disqualified, Ineligible, Volun-  \ntarily Retired or Military Lists:  \n1. The Clubs\u2019 obligations to tender and renew Contracts, as set  \nforth in paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player\u2019s Contract, shall  \napply with regard to any Player who, at the applicable time, is on a  \nRestricted List, or is on a Disqualified List for failure to render his  \nservices to his Club. Should a Club fail to so tender or renew a Con-  \ntract, the Player shall become a free agent without any restrictions  \nor qualifications, and he automatically shall be removed from the  \nRestricted or Disqualified List. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  \nPlayer who properly has been placed on the Restricted List for a  \nviolation of the Joint Drug Program or Joint Domestic Violence,  \nSexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy shall be eligible to become  \na free agent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set  \nforth therein, but shall remain on the Restricted List until he com-  \npletes his suspension.  \n2. With regard to any Player who is on the Disqualified List for  \na reason other than that stated in paragraph | above, or is on the Sus-  \npended, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military List, the Club  \nshall not be obligated to tender or renew a Contract until the Player  \nis removed from such List and reinstated to active status. If a Player  \nis removed from such List during a period beginning 10 days prior  \nto the tender date set forth in Article XX(A) and extending through  \nthe next championship season, the Club shall tender a Contract to  \nhim within 10 days following such removal. Thereafter, should the  \nClub and the Player fail to agree upon the terms of a new Contract  \nwithin 10 days after the Player\u2019s receipt of the tendered contract, the  \nClub shall be obligated, within the next 5 days, to renew the Player\u2019s  \nprior Major League Contract; provided, however, that if the tender  \nis made during the period beginning 10 days prior to the tender date  \nset forth in Article XX(A) and ending on the next March 1, the  \nrenewal period shall be as set forth in paragraph 10(a) of the Uni-  \nform Player\u2019s Contract. Should a Club fail to tender or renew a Con-  \ntract as provided in this paragraph, the Player shall become a free  \nagent without any restrictions or qualifications.  \n190  \nATTACHMENT 12  \nThis will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding Article  \nXX(A), of the Basic Agreement:  \nWith respect to a Minor League Player with no existing Major League  \nContract, whose Minor League contract has been assigned to a Major  \nLeague Club, it is understood that the placing of such a Player on the  \nMajor League Club\u2019s Active Reserve List (40-man Roster) and the ten-  \ndering to such a Player of a Major League Contract without the neces-  \nsity of renewing the Minor League contract will provide the Major  \nLeague Club with reservation rights to such a Player. Thus, such a  \nPlayer will not become a free agent under Article XX(A)(2)(d), which  \nprovides that a Player will become a free agent if his Club fails to exer-  \ncise its contract renewal rights, there being no prior Major League  \nContract to renew.  \n19]  \nATTACHMENT 13  \nTony C.

Participants. There shall be eight (8) participants in the Home  \nRun Derby. Participation shall be voluntary. The participants shall be  \nselected by the Office of the Commissioner, in consultation with the  \nPlayers Association based on the following criteria:  \nA.current season home run leaders;  \nB. prior success in the Home Run Derby;  \nC. the location of the game;  \nD. whether the player has been, or is likely to be, selected as an  \nAll-Star;  \nE. the player\u2019s home run totals in prior seasons;  \nF. recent milestone achievements by the player;  \nG. the player\u2019s popularity;  \nH. League representation; and  \nI. the number of Clubs represented by the proposed players.  \nThe Office of the Commissioner shall provide a list to the Players Asso-  \nciation of the eight players that it desires to participate in the Home Run  \nDerby. After making any adjustments to the list based on input received  \nfrom the Players Association, the Office of the Commissioner shall  \nrequest that the Players Association extend invitations to the eight play-  \ners on the list. If any of the eight players declines to participate in the  \nHome Run Derby, or if one or more of the selected players cannot par-  \n199  \nticipate due to injury, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide to  \nthe Players Association the names of additional players to be invited.  \nThe Players Association shall promptly report to the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner whether the players who have been invited have accepted the  \ninvitation. The Parties shall agree on a schedule by which all eight par-  \nticipants in the Home Run Derby shall be selected and announced.  \n2. Single-Elimination Bracket Format. As illustrated below, the  \nHome Run Derby shall be conducted in a single-elimination tourna-  \nment in which the loser of each bracket is immediately eliminated from  \nwinning. Brackets in the first round shall be seeded by the Office of the  \nCommissioner, in consultation with the Players Association, taking  \ninto consideration the following factors: (1) the player's performance in  \nthe prior season's Home Run Derby; (11) the player's current season  \nhome run total; (111) whether the player is a member of the Club host-  \ning the All-Star Game; (iv) All-Star votes received in the current sea-  \nson; and (v) any other appropriate factor as determined by the Parties.  \nWhenever possible, teammates will be seeded to avoid hitting against  \neach other in the first round of the tournament. The player with the  \nhigher seed in any given bracket shall have the option of hitting first or  \nsecond in that round.  \nRE  \n   \nPlayer 1/8  \nPlayer 4/5  \n   \nPlayer 2/7  \nPlayer 3/6  \n   \n3. Scoring/Advancement  \nA. Home Runs. Home runs shall be counted toward a batter\u2019s  \ntotal score, and any swings or hits that result in anything other than a  \nhome run shall not be counted.  \n200  \nB. Advancement/Winning. The batter with the most home  \nruns in each bracket shall eliminate his opponent and advance to the next  \nround (or win the tournament, if in the third round).  \nC. Tie-Breakers. Ties in any round shall be broken by a  \nstraight 60-second swing-off (with no stoppage of time or additional  \ntime added). If the batters remain tied after the 60-second swing-off,  \nthe batters shall engage in successive three-swing swing-offs until  \nthere is a winner.  \nD. Second Batter Advancement. Once the second batter in  \nany bracket hits one more home run than the first batter in that bracket,  \nthe second batter shall be declared the winner of that bracket and shall  \nnot attempt to hit any additional home runs.  \n4. Timers  \nA. 4:00 Regulation Period. Each batter shall have 4:00 min-  \nutes to hit as many home runs as possible within that period. Timers  \nwill be placed in appropriate places on and off the field, with certain  \ntimers clearly visible to the batter.  \nB. Release of Pitch. The timer will count down from 4:00  \nminutes beginning with the release of the first pitch.  \nC. Ending the Round. A round will end when the timer  \nstrikes zero. A home run shall count provided the pitch was released  \nbefore the timer strikes zero.  \nD. Successive Pitches. A pitcher cannot throw a pitch until a  \nbatted ball has hit the ground, was caught or left the field of play in  \nfoul territory. After a ball has been hit, the lead official will raise his  \nright hand in the air to signify to the pitcher that he may throw the next  \npitch to the batter.  \nE. Time Outs. Each batter in the first two rounds shall have  \nthe right to call one \u201ctime out\u201d per round. Batters in the final round  \nshall have the right to call two \u201ctime outs\u201d in that round. A batter shall  \ncall a \u201ctime out\u201d by raising his hand above his head or verbally  \nrequesting a time out from the official. The time out shall commence  \nwhen the official signals the timer operator to stop the timer, and shall  \nlast 45 seconds (the second \u201ctime out\u201d in the final round shall last 30  \nseconds). The official shall direct the batter to enter the batter\u2019s box at  \nthe end of the time out, and the timer shall commence when the pitcher  \nreleases the next pitch.  \n201  \nF. Bonus Period. In a given round, a batter will be awarded  \nthirty seconds of bonus time if he hits at least two home runs that each  \nequal or exceed 440 feet in that round. All distances will be measured  \nusing MLBAM\u2019s Statcast system. If Statcast 1s unable to record the  \ndistance of a home run, a batter only will be given credit for the home  \nrun for purposes of this bonus provision if there is no doubt that the  \nhome run landed at least 440 feet from home plate based on alternative  \nmethods of estimating the distance. Following the Regulation Period,  \nthere shall be a break of up to one minute (depending on the preference  \nof the batter) before the commencement of the Bonus Period. The  \ntimer will count down commencing with the release of the first pitch  \nin the Bonus Period.  \n5. Pitchers & Officiating  \nA. Pitchers. Each participant shall have the right to select his  \nown pitcher.  \nB. Official Scorer. The Office of the Commissioner will  \nselect an individual to serve as the Official Scorer of the event.

Bats. Players may use bats in colors or with designs not other-  \nwise permitted under Major League Baseball\u2019s Bat Regulations, pro-  \nvided that:  \nA. the bat meets all other requirements of a bat approved for use  \nin Professional Play (e.g., its dimensions and density are compliant  \nwith the Bat Regulations);  \nB. the bat does not contain any markings that are designed for a  \ncommercial purpose, including the promotion of a product or com-  \npany, other than the name and/or logo of the bat manufacturer in a size  \nthat complies with the Bat Regulations;  \nC. the bat does not contain any messages or images that may  \noffend fans, players or others associated with the event; and  \nD. participants will bring a sample bat to the meeting that pre-  \ncedes the event. A representative of the Commissioner\u2019s Office respon-  \nsible for bat compliance will attend the meeting together with a  \nrepresentative from the Players Association and check the bats. If any  \nbat 1s deemed by such representatives to be not in compliance, that par-  \nticipant will use his All-Star Game bat.  \nBats approved for use during the Home Run Derby under this  \nprovision may not be used during the All-Star Game or any other  \nMajor League or Minor League games (exhibition or otherwise).  \n8. Microphones. All participants in the Home Run Derby, and  \nplayers watching the event on the sidelines, will be encouraged by the  \nPlayers Association to wear a microphone pursuant to the standards  \ndescribed in Article XV(N)(8) (\u2018Miking\u2019\u2019). In no event shall less than  \nfour (4) participants wear a microphone for the event; provided that  \nstaff from the Players Association shall be exclusively responsible for  \ncommunications with Players in this regard.  \n9. Commercial Sponsorship Activities. At least the earlier of (a)  \npromptly following the date such sponsorships are secured or (b) seven  \ndays prior to the Home Run Derby, the Parties will discuss any oppor-  \ntunities for participants in the event to engage in sponsorship, endorse-  \nment or promotional activities in connection with any commercial  \nsponsors of the Home Run Derby. To that end, MLB shall send the  \nPlayers Association on or before that date, a list of all approved or  \nplanned sponsors and proposed promotional activities. If a sponsor  \nwants any player or players to wear or use such sponsor\u2019s product, serv-  \nice or logo, the Players Association must review and approve same.  \n203  \n10. Promotional Activities. The participants in the Home Run  \nDerby, upon request, will engage in two non-sponsored promotional  \nactivities for MLB or ESPN solely designed to promote the event. Any  \nrequested promotional activities beyond the two commitments refer-  \nenced above shall be completely voluntary for each participant. All  \npromotional activities shall take place at such times and places as will  \nbe convenient for the involved participant. The Office of the Commis-  \nsioner will provide the Players Association with written notice at least  \nthree days prior to the event of any such promotional activities  \nrequested under this paragraph. Failure to comply with the notice  \nrequirements hereunder shall result in the related obligations transi-  \ntioning to become entirely voluntary.  \n11. Charitable Contributions. The Office of the Commissioner  \nshall have the right, but not the obligation, to agree with a sponsor to  \nprovide a charitable contribution to the participants of the Home Run  \nDerby.  \n12. Notice of and Agreement to Modification. In the event that the  \nOffice of the Commissioner desires to modify this format in a manner  \nthat impacts terms and conditions of players\u2019 employment, it will propose  \nsuch method to the Association prior to May | of any year, and reach  \nagreement with the Association on the method before it is implemented.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDaniel R.

In the event my UPC 1s optioned to a minor  \nleague affiliate of the Club, I also authorize, during the period of my  \noptional assignment, the disclosure of health information to the Club\u2019s  \nFarm Director and to the minor league affiliate\u2019s Field Manager, Physi-  \ncians and such medical personnel as they may designate, and Certified  \nAthletic Trainer and Assistant Certified Athletic Trainer.

Uniform Dress Policy  \nThese Regulations are intended to supplement the provisions of Offi-  \ncial Baseball Rule 3.03. In accordance therewith, all Players are  \nrequired to be in uniform and to wear only Club-issued apparel, outer-  \nwear, and equipment during games (on the field, in the dugout, and in  \nthe bullpen). All Players are required to wear only Club-issued apparel,  \nouterwear, and equipment while on the field during batting practice  \nand while in any in-stadium interview room up to 30 minutes follow-  \ning games.

Pants may not be so baggy or otherwise sized or worn in such  \na manner that may, in the umpire\u2019s judgment, interfere with the  \numpire\u2019s ability to make calls or provide the Player with a com-  \npetitive advantage.  \n7. Pants pockets may not intentionally be untucked.  \n8. Every effort will be made to replace, in a timely fashion,  \npants torn during the game.  \n211  \nJerseys  \n1. Jerseys, including sleeves, may not be so baggy or otherwise  \nsized or worn in a manner which may, in the umpire\u2019s judgment,  \ninterfere with the umpire\u2019s ability to make calls or provide the  \nPlayer with a competitive advantage.  \n2. Sleeve length may not extend below the elbow.  \n3. Sleeves may not be cut.  \n4. Jerseys may not be unbuttoned below the bottom of the Club  \nlogo.  \n5.

A Player will not be permitted to change his jersey number  \neven if such request is approved by his Club unless the request  \nwas received by the Office of the Commissioner no later than  \nJuly 31 of the year preceding the championship season in which  \nthe jersey number change would take effect. Notwithstanding the  \nforegoing, the Office of the Commissioner will not deny a  \nrequest to change a Player\u2019s jersey number even when the requi-  \nsite notice was not provided if: (a) the Player changed Clubs fol-  \nlowing the notification deadline; or (b) the Player (or someone on  \nhis behalf) purchases the existing finished goods inventory of  \napparel containing the Player\u2019s jersey number that is held on  \nhand by the then-current authorized apparel licensee(s).  \nUndershirts  \n1. When any portion of a Player\u2019s undershirt is visible, the  \nPlayer may only wear an undershirt that is in the Club\u2019s primary  \ncolor or the heather gray color supplied by the Club.  \n2. Nocorporate identification or other logos of any kind are to be  \nvisible on any part of the undershirt, except for any Club logo, the  \nMajor League Baseball silhouetted batter logo or another logo  \njointly approved by Major League Baseball and the Association.  \n212  \nE.  \nCompression Sleeves  \nNo corporate identification or other logos of any kind are to be visible  \non any part of the compression sleeve, except for any Club logo, the  \nMajor League Baseball silhouetted batter logo or another logo jointly  \napproved by Major League Baseball and the Association.  \nF.  \nOuterwear  \nPlayers may not cut or in any way alter the Club-supplied outerwear.  \nG.  \nFootwear  \n1.

Shoes with pointed spikes similar to golf or track shoes shall  \nnot be worn.  \n4. Excessive and distracting flaps and laces on shoes, particu-  \nlarly those on pitchers, are not permitted.  \n5. Players will not be allowed to change shoes while running  \nbases during any Major League game.  \n6. The addition of tape that is a color different than that of the  \nshoe is not permitted and, if used, will mean the Player, coach or  \nmanager is out of uniform.  \nAdornments and Markings  \n1. No field personnel may wear distracting jewelry of any kind.  \nDistracting jewelry includes any item worn or used by a Player  \nwhich, in the opinion of the umpire, could interfere with the play  \nof the game or umpires\u2019 ability to make calls, or endanger the  \nhealth or safety of a Player, including the Player wearing the jew-  \n213  \nelry. In addition, no Player or Club may attach or otherwise affix  \nor embroider to any portion of the uniform (including the cap and  \nthe helmet, batter and catcher) or playing equipment (including  \ngloves), any pins, flags, commemorative patches, decals or other  \nitems, unless authorized by the Office of the Commissioner,  \nwhich shall consult with the Players Association on such matters  \nin advance of such authorization. A Player may not write, attach,  \naffix, embroider or otherwise display nicknames or messages on  \napparel or playing equipment, except that a Player may display:  \n(a) his name and/or uniform number on fielding gloves, footwear,  \nbatting gloves, wristbands, elbow protectors, shin/ankle protec-  \ntors and catcher\u2019s equipment; and (b) a nickname on fielding  \ngloves or catcher\u2019s equipment, provided that the nickname 1s not  \nvisible during games and is not reasonably likely to offend fans,  \nbusiness partners, Players, and others associated with the game.  \n2. No Player may have any visible corporate markings or logos  \ntattooed on his body. In addition, no pitcher shall have markings  \non his body that are potentially distracting to the umpire or batter.  \nMarkings that are potentially distracting include tattoo(s) or other  \nmarking(s) which, in the opinion of the umpire, could interfere  \nwith the umpires\u2019 ability to make calls, endanger the health or  \nsafety of a batter or otherwise interfere with the play of the game.  \n(a) If an umpire determines that a Player\u2019s tattoos or other mark-  \nings violate the above standard, the umpire shall inform the  \nOn-Field Department of the Office of the Commissioner,  \nwhich shall notify both the Player and the Players Associa-  \ntion. The umpire will not require the Player to cover the tat-  \ntoos or markings prior to being instructed to do so by the  \nOffice of the Commissioner.  \n(b) If a Player desires to appeal the umpire\u2019s decision to the  \nChief Baseball Officer, he must do so within 24 hours of  \nreceiving notice. The Player will not be required to cover his  \ntattoos or markings between the filing of an appeal and a  \ndecision by the Chief Baseball Officer.  \n(c) The Player, the Players Association and the Player\u2019s Club  \nmay present to the Chief Baseball Officer any arguments or  \ninformation they desire in support of the appeal. The decision  \nof the Chief Baseball Officer regarding whether the Player  \n214  \nJ.  \nmust cover his tattoos or markings will be final and binding  \non the Player, the Players Association, Major League Clubs  \nand umpires.  \nPermissible Alterations  \n1. Pant length alterations consistent with past practice and Sec-  \ntion B, above.  \n2. Sleeve length alterations consistent with past practice and  \nSection C, above.  \n3. Tapering of pants and jerseys.  \nWristbands  \nNo Player is permitted to wear white wristbands or bandages, because  \nof the possible difficulty in distinguishing the baseball from the wrist-  \nband or bandage. This prohibition extends to white wristbands with a  \nstripe insufficient to permit the distinction.  \nK.  \nGloves  \n1. Any pitcher starting or entering a game wearing a colored  \nglove must wear a glove of the same color for the pitcher\u2019s entire  \nparticipation in the game.  \n2. The pitcher\u2019s glove may not, exclusive of piping, be white,  \ngray, nor, in the judgment of an umpire, distracting in any man-  \nner. See Official Baseball Rule 3.07(a).  \n3. Any Player wearing a golf or batting glove underneath a play-  \ning glove may not rub up balls for use by the pitcher.  \nHelmets  \n1. Each catcher shall wear a catcher\u2019s protective helmet while  \nfielding the position. Provided that such protective helmet has  \nbeen approved by the Official Playing Rules Committee, a  \ncatcher may wear any protective helmet that conforms with past  \npractice. See Official Baseball Rule 3.09.  \n215  \n2. All batting helmets must have the Major League Baseball sil-  \nhouetted batter logo on the back of the helmet and may not  \ninclude any corporate logos. The Club and Major League Base-  \nball silhouetted batter logos cannot be obscured.  \nOther  \n1. A catcher entering the on-deck circle as the next batter shall  \nhave removed his shin guards before entering the on-deck circle.  \n2. Catchers\u2019 shin guards and chest protectors may not contain  \nany white (other than the corporate logo).  \n3. A Player will not be permitted to display corporate logos or  \nother identifying marks on equipment, apparel or outerwear other  \nthan on: (a) the items set forth in the Uniform Regulations\u2019  \nLogo/ID Specifications; (b) items issued by his Club; or (c) items  \nthat at least ten players have regularly used or worn in a game  \nprior to the conclusion of the 2011 championship season. With  \nrespect to any category of equipment or apparel not covered by  \nthe Uniform Regulations, the Players Association and Major  \nLeague Baseball will explore in good faith the possibility of  \njointly selling an exclusive or non-exclusive license for that cat-  \negory of equipment or apparel. If the sale of such a joint license  \nis not feasible and Major League Baseball objects to the display  \nof a logo or marks on a particular product, the Player cannot dis-  \nplay the logo or marks until the Parties resolve the issue or, if  \nMajor League Baseball files a grievance under Article XI(B) of  \nthe Basic Agreement, the completion of an expedited grievance  \nprocess. In a grievance arbitration over this issue, both Parties  \nreserve all of their arguments under the Basic Agreement, the  \nMajor League Rules, the Official Baseball Rules, and the Uni-  \nform Player\u2019s Contract to support their respective positions.  \nNothing in this paragraph is intended to prohibit a Player from  \nusing equipment permitted under the Official Baseball Rules if  \nthe corporate logos or marks are concealed.  \n4. MLB-Designated Theme Days. Players are prohibited from  \nwearing items and using equipment consistent with a Major  \nLeague Baseball-designated theme for a specific game day (e.g.,  \nMother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day,  \netc.) except for such specific items or equipment that have been  \n216  \nN.  \napproved and communicated with reasonable advance notice to  \nthe Players Association and the Clubs\u2019 equipment managers. Vio-  \nlations of this policy will be deemed to be flagrant under Para-  \ngraph 4 of Section O, below.  \nTo the extent that a Player desires to wear an item or use equip-  \nment that is not authorized for use on an MLB-Designated theme  \nday, the Player must obtain advance approval from the Commis-  \nsioner\u2019s Office, which approval shall not be unreasonably with-  \nheld, provided that: (a) the color and design of the item or  \nequipment is consistent with that of the particular theme day; (b)  \nno corporate logos or distinguishing marks are displayed on the  \nitem or equipment; and (c) the category of item or equipment has  \nbeen approved for use in Major League games on non-theme  \ndays. It is encouraged that the manufacturer of the item or equip-  \nment contributes funds to the designated charity of the theme day.  \nIn addition, the Office of the Commissioner shall: make available  \nto Players, if practical, non-logoed items or equipment if the  \nPlayer wants to participate in the theme day event but does not  \ndesire to use a product manufactured by the designated corporate  \nsponsor; and, provide the Players Association with recognition  \nsupporting theme day. A player who declines to participate, in  \nwhole or in part, in any MLB-designated theme day shall be per-  \nmitted to wear any item or use any equipment he would otherwise  \nuse/wear during a non-theme day.  \nEnforcement  \nThe Chief Baseball Officer shall enforce these Regulations and impose  \ndiscipline as set forth in Section O below. In addition, umpires shall  \nhave the authority to enforce on the field those Regulations that cover  \nthe traditional domain of umpires. (See, e.g., Official Playing Rule  \n3.08 (Comment). )  \nO. Discipline  \n1. Players will be subject to the following discipline schedule  \nfor violations of these Uniform Regulations:  \n(a) First violation: the Chief Baseball Officer will issue a Uni-  \nform Regulations Violation Warning, setting forth the provi-  \n217  \n(b)  \n(Cc)  \n(d)  \nsion of the Uniform Regulations that the Player has violated  \nand specifying that the Player will be subject to further disci-  \npline if he does not immediately cease violating the Regula-  \ntions;  \nSecond violation within the same Section of the Uniform  \nRegulations or regarding the same \u201cProduct\u201d on the Uniform  \nand Equipment Logo/ID Specifications: the Chief Baseball  \nOfficer will issue a Notice of Discipline, which levies a  \n$1,000 fine and sets forth the provision of the Uniform Reg-  \nulations that the Player has violated for the second time and  \nspecifies that the Player will be subject to additional disci-  \npline if he does not immediately cease violating the Regula-  \ntions;  \nThird violation within the same Section of the Uniform Reg-  \nulations or regarding the same \u201cProduct\u201d on the Uniform and  \nEquipment Logo/ID Specifications: the Chief Baseball Offi-  \ncer will issue a Notice of Discipline, which levies a $5,000  \nfine and sets forth the provision of the Uniform Regulations  \nthat the Player has violated for the third time and specifies  \nthat the Player will be subject to additional discipline if he  \ndoes not immediately cease violating the Regulations;  \nFourth violation within the same Section of the Uniform  \nRegulations or regarding the same \u201cProduct\u201d on the Uniform  \nand Equipment Logo/ID Specifications: the Chief Baseball  \nOfficer will issue a Notice of Discipline, which levies a  \n$10,000 fine and sets forth the provision of the Uniform Reg-  \nulations that the Player has violated for the fourth time and  \ndirects that the Player will not be permitted to play in  \nchampionship season games (including Spring Training and  \npost-season games, if applicable) until the Player\u2019s uniform  \nis in compliance with the Regulations and the Official Play-  \ning Rules.  \n2. The fine schedule set forth in Paragraph 1 above shall apply  \nno matter how much time has elapsed between violations.  \n3. Complaints involving discipline imposed upon a Player by  \nthe Chief Baseball Officer for a violation of the Uniform Regula-  \ntions shall be subject exclusively to Article XI(C) of the Basic  \n218  \nAgreement. If the Chief Baseball Officer imposes discipline con-  \nsistent with Paragraph | above, the only issue before the Special  \nAssistant to the Commissioner shall be whether the Player com-  \nmitted the violation alleged in the Notice of Discipline. If the  \nSpecial Assistant to the Commissioner finds that the Player com-  \nmitted the violation alleged in the Notice of Discipline, the disci-  \npline shall be as set forth in the Notice of Discipline. In cases  \ninvolving discipline imposed under Paragraph 1.c above, the  \nSpecial Assistant to the Commissioner shall attempt to hear the  \nappeal within two weeks of the date on which it was filed. If the  \nappeal cannot be heard during that period due to the Player\u2019s  \nunwillingness to participate in the city in which his Club is  \nscheduled to play or the Players Association\u2019s inability to travel  \nto such city, the appeal shall be heard by teleconference. If the  \nappeal cannot be heard during that period for any other reason,  \nthe appeal shall be heard, in the city in which the Player\u2019s Club  \nis scheduled to play, at the earliest available date. In cases involv-  \ning discipline imposed under Paragraph 1.d above, the appeal  \nshall be heard as soon as practicable in a location that does not  \nmake the Player unavailable to play or the city where the Player\u2019s  \nClub is scheduled to play, but not later than 4 business days from  \nthe imposition of the directive.  \n4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will apply to a  \nviolation of Section M.3 after a warning and to repeated or a sin-  \ngle flagrant or provocative breach of the Uniform Regulations  \ninvolving an intentional impermissible alteration, writing or  \nillustration or other marking made by a Player to any part of his  \nuniform (including the cap and the helmet, batter or catcher):  \n(a) The Chief Baseball Officer may impose fines at levels differ-  \nent from the levels reflected in Paragraph 1 above. Com-  \nplaints involving a fine imposed upon a Player by the Chief  \nBaseball Officer that is greater than the amount set forth in  \nParagraph | for such violation shall be subject exclusively to  \nArticle XI(C) of the Basic Agreement but the Player may  \nchallenge the level of discipline imposed in addition to the  \nfact that discipline was imposed.  \n(b) The Chief Baseball Officer may direct, prior to the fourth  \nsuch violation, that the Player will not be permitted to play in  \n219  \n(c)  \nchampionship season games (including Spring Training and  \npost-season games, if applicable) until the Player\u2019s uniform is  \nin compliance with the Regulations and the Official Playing  \nRules. Complaints involving such a directive shall be subject  \nexclusively to Article XI(C) of the Basic Agreement but the  \nPlayer may challenge the level of discipline imposed in addi-  \ntion to the fact that discipline was imposed. The implementa-  \ntion of such a directive shall not be stayed by a Player\u2019s  \nappeal. A Player\u2019s appeal of such a directive shall be heard as  \nsoon as practicable in a location that does not make the Player  \nunavailable to play or in the city where the Player\u2019s Club is  \nscheduled to play, but not later than 4 business days from the  \nimposition of the directive. A Player precluded from play  \nbecause of failure to comply with such a directive shall not be  \npaid for any game missed as a result of such discipline; pro-  \nvided, however, that such Player shall be made whole pur-  \nsuant to Article XII(A) of the Basic Agreement if his appeal  \nof such discipline is upheld in full or in part.  \nThe Chief Baseball Officer may not impose any other disci-  \npline, including a suspension, upon a Player for any such vio-  \nlation.  \n5. Fines issued by the Chief Baseball Officer for any violations  \nof the Uniform Regulations shall be payable within two weeks  \nfrom the date of the Notice of Discipline. All fine payments  \n(made payable to Major League Baseball) must be sent to the  \nDepartment of On-Field Operations at Major League Baseball.  \n220  \nMAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL  \nUniform and Equipment Logo/ID Specifications  \nProposed Number of  \nProduct Manufacturer\u2019s Logo/ID Placements  \nOne mark \u2014 3 sq in (with  \nBatting Glove no dimension less 1.25 in)  \nSecond mark \u2014 1.5 sq in  \nFront mark \u2014 6.5 sq in (with  \nno dimension less  \nCatcher\u2019s Chest Protector than 1.75 in)  \nBack mark \u2014 2.5 sq in (with  \nno dimension less than 1 in)  \n1 sq in  \nCatcher\u2019s Face Mask (with no dimension  \nless than 1 in)  \nTwo  \n(one front, one back)  \n1 sq in  \nCatcher\u2019s Helmet (with no dimension  \nless than 1 in)  \nTwo  \n(one front, one back)  \n1.5 sq in  \nCatcher\u2019s Knee Support (with no dimension  \nless than 1 in)  \n1.5 sq in  \nCatcher\u2019s Shin Guard (with no dimension  \nless than 1 in)  \n1 sq in  \nElbow Protector (with no dimension  \nless than 1 in)  \n1 sq in  \nShin/Ankle Protector (with no dimension  \nless than 1 in)  \nSunglass Strap  \nEither one on bridge of  \nSunglasses . 1 nose or one on each  \n\u201ctemple\u201d of glasses  \n. . . .

Halem  \nChief Legal Officer  \nMajor League Baseball  \nOffice of the Commissioner  \n245 Park Avenue  \nNew York, New York 10167  \nDear Dan:  \nThe Clubs, throughout this and previous rounds of negotiations, have  \nconsistently maintained that the Commissioner\u2019s regulation of industry  \ndebt is not a mandatory subject of bargaining under the National Labor  \nRelations Act. We, on the other hand, have consistently taken the posi-  \ntion that it is.  \nIn furtherance of the negotiations on an overall Basic Agreement, you  \nproposed changes to the debt regulations known as the Debt Service  \nRule, contingent upon a prior acknowledgment by the Association that  \nthe proposal and any discussion that it may generate, including any  \nsubsequent counterproposals, are without prejudice to the Clubs\u2019 legal  \nposition on bargainability.  \nThe Association, by this letter, provides that acknowledgment. It  \nagrees that the proposal and discussions shall not be used as evidence  \nby the Association that the topic of debt regulation is a mandatory sub-  \nject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, including any grievance  \nor NLRB proceeding.  \nThis acknowledgment and agreement is, of course, without prejudice  \nto the Association\u2019s position that the topic is a mandatory one.  \nSincerely,  \nTony C. Clark  \nExecutive Director  \nMajor League Baseball Players  \nAssociation  \n223  \nATTACHMENT 21  \nTony C. Clark  \nExecutive Director  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nRe: Debt Regulation  \nDear Tony:  \nThis letter will memorialize our additional understandings on debt reg-  \nulation, and shall be considered an agreement between the Association  \nand the Clubs within the meaning of Article XI(A)(1)(a) of the Basic  \nAgreement.  \nFirst, the Parties agree that the Panel cannot resolve disputes concern-  \ning the meaning, interpretation or application of the Debt Service Rule  \nwithout resort to its bargaining history, in this or earlier bargaining  \nrounds, which reflects understandings that significantly inform the  \nmeaning of the Rule as intended by the Parties.  \nSecond, our negotiations over and agreement to the Debt Service Rule  \nare both subject to the agreement reflected in Attachment 20. More-  \nover, the Parties reserve their legal positions regarding the bargaining  \nstatus of any action taken by the Commissioner pursuant to Section 6.1  \nof the Debt Service Rule.  \nThird, it was the Parties\u2019 intention, in agreeing to the Debt Service  \nRule, to ensure that each individual Club has or would have sufficient  \nresources to support its level of debt or proposed debt, as opposed to  \nan intention to limit or reduce the amount that the Clubs or a particu-  \nlar Club could spend on Player salaries.  \nFourth, the Parties do not intend for the Debt Service Rule to displace  \nor otherwise limit the authority of the Commissioner to take actions,  \nconsistent with actions taken in the past, that are designed to preserve  \nthe financial stability of the Clubs. As he has done in the past, the  \nCommissioner will consult with the Players Association prior to taking  \nany such action against a Club that may affect the interests of Players.  \n224  \nFifth, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to Paragraph 6.1  \nof the Debt Service Rule, the Commissioner shall adopt no other form  \nof debt regulation.  \nSincerely,  \nDaniel R. Halem  \nChief Legal Officer  \nMajor League Baseball  \nOffice of the Commissioner  \n225  \nATTACHMENT 22  \nSection 1.  \nSection 2.  \nDEBT SERVICE RULE  \nThe Rule. No Club may maintain more Total Club Debt  \nthan can reasonably be supported by its EBITDA. A  \nClub\u2019s Total Club Debt cannot reasonably be supported by  \nits EBITDA if Total Club Debt exceeds the product of that  \nClub\u2019s EBITDA during the most recent year multiplied by  \nthe EBITDA Multiplier applicable to that Club.  \nDefinitions. Subject to the amendment procedures set out  \nin Section 6.1 below, the following definitions shall be uti-  \nlized in the administration of the Debt Service Rule:  \n(a) EBITDA. \u201cEBITDA\u201d means a Club\u2019s earnings for  \nits fiscal year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and  \namortization, as calculated and reported in accordance  \nwith Part I, Schedule I, Section D, Line 45 of the annual  \nFinancial Information Questionnaire (\u201cFIQ\u201d\u2019), which each  \nClub must submit to the Office of the Commissioner after  \nthe close of each fiscal year. For the purposes of this Debt  \nService Rule, each Club shall calculate its annual  \nEBITDA net of the Club\u2019s net receipts or net payments  \nunder any revenue sharing arrangements then in effect  \namong the Major League Clubs.  \n(b) Total Club Debt. \u201cTotal Club Debt\u201d means a  \nClub\u2019s total outstanding debt, calculated as an average  \nover the course of each fiscal year, including, without lim-  \nitation, all long-term and short-term obligations and all  \nindebtedness resulting from: (1) debt incurred pursuant to  \nthe Major League Baseball industry credit facility; (2)  \nClub Supported Debt incurred by the Club or any Club  \nrelated party; provided that with respect to any third-party  \nindebtedness incurred by a Club related party, such indebt-  \nedness shall be deemed to be Club Supported Debt unless  \nthe Club delivers all relevant Club related party financial  \nstatements and annual budgets to the Office of the Com-  \nmissioner and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the  \nOffice of the Commissioner, that such indebtedness is  \n226  \nserviceable or payable, in whole, by non-Club funds  \n(regardless of whether such indebtedness is collateralized  \nby assets of the Club); (3) deferred compensation (other  \nthan deferred compensation payable to Major League  \nPlayers (see clause (9) below)); (4) stadium-related debt  \nincurred for or in connection with ballpark construction or  \nimprovements; provided, however, that any debt falling  \nwithin this clause (4) shall not become part of Total Club  \nDebt until the first full season of the operation of the new  \nor renovated stadium for which such debt was incurred;  \nand (5) any other debt that is properly classified as indebt-  \nedness of the Club under generally accepted accounting  \nprinciples in place as of the effective date of this Basic  \nAgreement, but excluding: (6) the Excludable Debt; (7)  \nadvances taken by a Club against future revenue that it is  \ncontractually entitled to receive; (8) any debt issued in  \nconnection with the monetization of a long-term Club  \nbusiness contract, the proceeds of which are placed into an  \nescrow account controlled by the Office of the Commis-  \nsioner; and (9) any compensation payable to Major League  \nPlayers, including deferred compensation or any other  \ncommitment under a Uniform Player\u2019s Contract, or any  \nobligation to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit  \nPlan or Industry Growth Fund. \u201cExcludable Debt\u201d shall be  \nthe first seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) in out-  \nstanding debt from any of the sources described in clauses  \n(1)-(5) above. \u201cClub Supported Debt\u201d means any indebt-  \nedness (including any loan, advance or guarantee) that is  \ncollateralized by the assets of the Club (including any  \npledge of a direct or indirect interest in the Club) or serv-  \niced or payable, in whole or in part, either directly or indi-  \nrectly, using Club funds; provided that, with respect to any  \nloans or advances from a Club\u2019s owner or any related  \nparty that are neither collateralized by the assets of the  \nClub (including any pledge of a direct or indirect interest  \nin the Club) nor serviced, in whole or in part, either  \ndirectly or indirectly, using Club funds, such indebtedness  \nshall be deemed to be Club Supported Debt if the Club has  \nnot delivered all relevant related party financial statements  \nand annual budgets to the Office of the Commissioner.  \n227  \n(c) EBITDA Multiplier. \u201cEBITDA Multiplier\u201d means  \nthe number to be multiplied by the Club\u2019s EBITDA during  \nthe most recent year in order to determine the maximum  \nTotal Club Debt that reasonably can be supported by that  \nClub\u2019s EBITDA. The EBITDA Multiplier shall be eight  \n(8), except that any Club which incurs (or has incurred  \nwithin the last ten years) stadium-related debt to finance  \nconstruction of a new ballpark or the major renovation of  \nits existing ballpark may use an EBITDA Multiplier of  \ntwelve (12) for the first ten (10) fiscal years after that ball-  \npark\u2019s opening or reopening.  \n(d) Accounting Rules. Each Club\u2019s reporting and  \naccounting practices relevant to an evaluation of its compli-  \nance with the Debt Service Rule shall be subject to the  \nCommissioner\u2019s review and approval. Moreover, in any  \ncase involving off-balance-sheet debt, the determination of  \nwhether the indebtedness shall be included in Total Club  \nDebt under Section 2(b) above shall be made by an auditor  \nretained by the Office of the Commissioner, applying gen-  \nerally accepted accounting principles on a consolidated  \nbasis except as otherwise provided by Section 2(b) above.  \nThe Major League Baseball Players Association (\u201cPlayers  \nAssociation\u201d) may seek review of the auditor\u2019s determina-  \ntion by the Arbitration Panel (see Article XI), in which case  \nthe Panel shall show no deference to the auditor\u2019s determi-  \nnation. Unless otherwise provided in this Rule, when  \naccounting for and reporting on Total Club Debt and  \nEBITDA for purposes of the Debt Service Rule, the Clubs  \nshall comply with the revenue and expense definitions and  \nthe accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected  \nin the then-current version of the FIQ. The Commissioner  \nreserves the right to modify the FIQ reporting requirements  \nas they relate to the Debt Service Rule. The Players Associ-  \nation may seek review of all accounting rulings made by the  \nCommissioner (or any Committee or outside accounting or  \nother expert assisting him), in connection with the Rule by  \nthe Arbitration Panel in which case the Panel shall show no  \ndeference to the Commissioner\u2019s rulings.  \n228  \nSection 3. Annual Compliance Certification; Commissioner  \nEnforcement.  \n3.1 Annual Compliance Certifications. By the date each  \nClub must provide its final FIQ and audited financial  \nstatements for each fiscal year, each Club shall also sub-  \nmit to the Office of the Commissioner:  \n(a) a written certification from its chief executive offi-  \ncer that either the Club complied with the Debt Service  \nRule during the fiscal year reported in the accompanying  \nFIQ, or the Club did not comply with the Debt Service  \nRule during the fiscal year reported in the accompanying  \nFIQ; and  \n(b) a written summary (\u2018\u201cRelated-Party Debt Sum-  \nmary\u201d) from its chief executive officer of all owner or  \nrelated-party debt that was collateralized by Club assets or  \nwas serviced, either directly or indirectly, using Club funds  \nor assets.  \n3.2 Enforcement by Commissioner. The failure of a Club  \nto comply with the Debt Service Rule in a fiscal year shall  \nsubject the Club and/or any owner of the Club to any or all  \nof the remedial measures (\u201cRemedial Measures\u201d\u2019) set out  \nin Section 4 below until the Club achieves compliance  \nwith the Debt Service Rule.  \n3.3 Exemption from Compliance. Clubs with Total Club  \nDebt below the level of Excludable Debt are exempt from  \nthe compliance process (but still must adhere to the certi-  \nfication requirement of Section 3.1 above and the financial  \nreporting obligations established by the Office of the  \nCommissioner, the latter of which are described in Attach-  \nment 23).  \nSection 4. Remedial Measures for Non-Compliance.  \n4.1 The Commissioner may, after consultation with the  \nPlayers Association pursuant to Section 6.4(d) below and  \nconsistent with Section 5 and Section 6.5 below, impose  \nany or all of the Remedial Measures contained in Section  \n4.2 on any Club and/or any owner of a Club for a Club\u2019s  \nfailure to comply with the Debt Service Rule. Notwith-  \n229  \nstanding the foregoing, the Commissioner shall not  \nimpose Remedial Measures on a Club and/or owner of a  \nClub for a Club\u2019s failure to comply with the Debt Service  \nRule if the Club complied with the Debt Service Rule in  \nthe immediately preceding year and the Club demonstrates  \nthat it realistically projects compliance in the year follow-  \ning its first year of non-compliance.  \n4.2 The Remedial Measures are:  \n(a) Require the Club to submit, for the Commissioner\u2019s  \nreview and approval, a written plan for achieving compli-  \nance with the Debt Service Rule (the \u201cCompliance  \nEach Compliance Plan shall identify the fiscal year during  \nwhich the Club proposes to achieve compliance and the  \nspecific steps the Club intends to take to bring the Club  \ninto compliance with the Debt Service Rule;  \n(b) Require the Club to consult with the Commissioner  \nprior to entering into any contract with a term of more than  \nfive (5) years (except that this Section 4(b) shall not apply  \nto any Uniform Player\u2019s Contract with a Major League  \nPlayer);  \n(c) Prohibit the Club from incurring any additional  \nClub Debt (as defined in this Rule) without the approval  \nof the Commissioner;  \n(d) Require the Club to reduce some or all of its out-  \nstanding debt by raising additional equity on whatever  \nterms the Commissioner deems appropriate;  \n(ec) Prohibit the Club from making any capital expendi-  \ntures without the approval of the Commissioner;  \n(f) Require the Club to perform or refrain from any  \nother action that the Commissioner deems necessary in  \norder to ensure that the Club brings its Total Club Debt  \ninto compliance with the Debt Service Rule;  \n(g) Retention by the Commissioner of all or any por-  \ntion of the Club\u2019s share of: (1) the Central Fund, and/or (11)  \ngate receipts from the Wild Card Game, Division Series,  \nLeague Championship Series and World Series, so that  \n230  \nsuch retained funds may be held in escrow and used as  \ndirected by the Commissioner to reduce the Club\u2019s out-  \nstanding debt, subject to the Club\u2019s existing obligations to  \nplayers and subject to contractual obligations to third par-  \nties made by the Club in good faith before the Club had  \nnotice of the proposed adoption of the Debt Service Rule;  \n(h) Reservation by the Commissioner of the power to  \napprove a Club\u2019s general and administrative expenditures,  \nincluding, without limitation, the power to approve and/or  \nlimit individual line items in a Club\u2019s annual budget;  \n(1) Limit, or suspend, the Club\u2019s ability to obtain addi-  \ntional financing under the Major League Baseball industry  \ncredit facility and/or any other line of credit or financing  \narrangement obtained on behalf of that Club or on behalf  \nof all Clubs by the Office of the Commissioner;  \n(j) Suspend the benefit of the Major League Rules,  \nsuch as selection rights available to the Club under Major  \nLeague Rule 5, except that any suspension of the Club\u2019s  \nrights under Major League Rule 4 shall not affect the  \nassignment of the selection rights that the Club would lose  \nor gain in connection with a player signing as provided in  \nany collectively bargained agreement then in effect  \nbetween the Clubs and the Players Association;  \n(k) Deny the Club\u2019s right to be represented at Major  \nLeague meetings and/or deny representation on Major  \nLeague Committees;  \n(1) Suspend individual executive or ownership person-  \nnel of the Club;  \n(m) Impose monetary sanctions against individual  \nexecutive or ownership personnel of the Club;  \n(n) Any other measures or sanctions which the Com-  \nmissioner has the power to impose on a Club or Club  \nowner pursuant to the Major League Constitution;  \n(o) Any sanction which the Major League Clubs may  \nimpose upon another Club or Club owner under the Major  \nLeague Constitution, if the imposition of such a sanction  \n231  \nSection 5.  \nSection 6.  \nis duly authorized by the vote of the Major League Clubs  \nin the manner required by the Major League Constitution;  \nand/or  \n(p) Require ownership to guarantee the Club\u2019s debt  \nservice for the next three years, without recourse to the  \nClub. Subject to liquidity concerns that the Commissioner  \nmay have, mandatory debt reduction (see subparagraphs (c)  \nand (d) above) shall be the preferred Remedial Measure.  \nRemedial Considerations. In developing a set of Reme-  \ndial Measures for a Club under Section 4 above, the Com-  \nmissioner shall consider the following factors:  \n(a) As an initial matter, the Commissioner must assess  \nthe Club\u2019s general creditworthiness as reflected in the  \navailability of credit to the Club in commercial markets  \n(through measures such as but not limited to the terms on  \nwhich it holds debt and the willingness of the Club\u2019s indi-  \nvidual lenders to attest to their confidence that the Club  \nwill be able to satisfy its obligations as they become due)  \nand in the asset value of the Club in relation to the absolute  \nlevel of the Club\u2019s debt;  \n(b) The Club\u2019s record of compliance with the Rule  \nover the preceding three years;  \n(c) The Club\u2019s projection of compliance or non-com-  \npliance over the three-year planning period in conjunction  \nwith the Club\u2019s past history of accurately projecting com-  \npliance or non-compliance;  \n(d) The occurrence of factors affecting the industry  \nwhich have affected the ability of all Clubs to comply with  \nthe Debt Service Rule such that there has been a signifi-  \ncant increase in the number of non-compliant Clubs; and  \n(e) The capacity and willingness of the owner or own-  \ners to guarantee debt service for the next three years, with-  \nout recourse to the Club.  \nMiscellaneous  \n6.1 Further Regulations; Amendments. The Commis-  \nsioner shall issue further regulations and policies concern-  \nZod  \ning the implementation, interpretation, administration and  \nenforcement of this Debt Service Rule as he deems appro-  \npriate. In addition, the Commissioner may amend or oth-  \nerwise modify the rules, definitions and policies set out in  \nthis Debt Service Rule as he deems appropriate. Prior to  \ntaking any action pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Office  \nof the Commissioner shall provide the Players Association  \nwith notice of such contemplated action pursuant to Arti-  \ncle XVIII of the Basic Agreement.  \n6.2 Notice to Third Parties. All Clubs shall give appro-  \npriate written notice to affected third parties of the require-  \nments of the Debt Service Rule before entering into any  \ncontract with such parties that reasonably might be  \naffected, as to either execution or performance, by the  \nCommissioner\u2019s exercise of his powers under this Debt  \nService Rule.  \n6.3 Prohibited Remedial Measures. The Commissioner  \nshall not, in exercising his authority under Section 4  \nabove, attempt to influence or interfere with any Club  \ndecision regarding a Major League Player\u2019s contract,  \nreserve status or roster status. Moreover, the Commis-  \nsioner shall take no action directed at preventing a Club  \nfrom establishing its Major League Player payroll budget  \nat a level that the Club deems appropriate.  \n6.4 Players Association\u2019s Right To Information. The  \nOffice of the Commissioner shall provide the Players  \nAssociation with the following information:  \n(a) EBITDA, Total Club Debt and total allowable debt  \n(EBITDA multiplied by the applicable EBITDA Multi-  \nplier) calculations for each Club, at the time the Office of  \nthe Commissioner provides FIQs to the Players Associa-  \ntion pursuant to Article XXIV(D)(2) of the Basic Agree-  \nment and at any time as such calculations may be provided  \nto the Commissioner on an interim or forecast basis prior  \nto the Clubs\u2019 FIQ submissions;  \n(b) Related-Party Debt Summaries and Compliance  \nPlans submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to this  \n233  \nRule, within seven days of receipt by the Office of the  \nCommissioner;  \n(c) Correspondence from the Office of the Commis-  \nsioner or a Club in connection with the operation of Sec-  \ntion 4 above, within seven days of the Office of the  \nCommissioner\u2019s transmittal or receipt of such correspon-  \ndence; and  \n(d) Drafts of proposed correspondence to Clubs impos-  \ning Remedial Measures pursuant to Section 4 above.  \nWithin ten (10) days of providing such drafts, the Office  \nof the Commissioner shall meet with the Players Associa-  \ntion to discuss the Remedial Measures contemplated by  \nthe Commissioner.  \nAny documents and/or other information provided to  \nthe Players Association pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall  \nbe covered by the Parties\u2019 Confidentiality Agreement (see  \nAttachment 14).  \nThe Office of the Commissioner must notify the Play-  \ners Association of any changes in the central debt agree-  \nments.  \n6.5 Sale Transactions. In all transactions involving the  \nsale or transfer of a control interest in a Club, and prior to  \nthe approval of any such transaction, the prospective new  \nClub ownership must provide the Commissioner with a  \nLong Term Plan for Debt Service compliance (Long Term  \nPlan). The Long Term Plan shall be supported by specific  \nfinancial information and shall cover no fewer than two  \nyears but no more than five years. The Commissioner will  \nissue written comments on the Long Term Plan prior to the  \ntransaction\u2019s approval. In connection with all such transac-  \ntions, the Commissioner must certify to the Clubs and to  \nthe Players Association that the level of debt undertaken in  \nconnection with the acquisition or transfer will not create a  \npersistent inability of the Club to comply with the require-  \nments of the Debt Service Rule. As part of that certifica-  \ntion, the Commissioner, within 30 days of approval of the  \ntransaction, will provide to the Players Association the new  \n234  \nClub ownership\u2019s Long Term Plan and the Commissioner\u2019s  \nwritten comments on the Long Term Plan. Absent material  \ndeviations from the Long Term Plan, a Club will be exempt  \nfrom Section 4 remediation for the duration of the Long  \nTerm Plan.  \n6.6 Reopener; Right To Strike. In the event of an increase  \nin the maximum debt available to an individual Club  \nunder the industry credit facility of greater than 30%,  \nmeasured off an amortized basis, the Players Association  \nmay reopen this Agreement, upon the giving of 10 days\u2019  \nwritten notice, with reference solely to the level of Exclud-  \nable Debt. If negotiations in good faith following such  \nreopener do not produce an agreement, the Players Asso-  \nciation will have the right to strike over the topic of the  \nlevel of Excludable Debt. This grant of the right to strike  \nis without prejudice to the Parties\u2019 respective positions as  \nto whether the Rule is a mandatory topic of bargaining and  \nto any other assertions the Clubs may have that such a  \nstrike would otherwise be illegal.  \n235  \nATTACHMENT 23  \nTony C.

Clark  \nExecutive Director  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nDear Tony:  \nThe purpose of this letter is to confirm that the Parties have agreed to  \nestablish a Joint Treatment Program to deal with certain alcohol-  \nrelated conduct and off-field violent conduct by Major League Players  \nduring the term of the Basic Agreement. Specifically, the  \nParties have agreed as follows:  \n1.  \nThe Treatment Board, as defined under Major League Baseball\u2019s  \nJoint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, will be responsi-  \nble for creating and supervising individualized treatment pro-  \ngrams for Players with an alcohol use problem or Players who  \nhave engaged in off-field violent conduct. Notwithstanding the  \nforegoing, if such conduct constitutes a \u201cCovered Act\u201d under the  \nJoint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy  \n(see Attachment 52), Player evaluation and treatment shall be pur-  \nsuant to the terms of that Policy.  \nReferral to the Treatment Board will be mandatory when:  \n(a) A Player is arrested or charged by law enforcement authori-  \nties with driving while intoxicated, driving under the influ-  \nence of alcohol, or any other criminal violation relating to the  \nuse of alcohol.  \n(b) A Player is arrested or charged by law enforcement authori-  \nties with a criminal violation in which the authorities allege  \nthat the use of alcohol may have been a contributing factor in  \nthe misconduct.  \n(c) A Player appears intoxicated during any of the Club\u2019s games,  \npractices, workouts, meetings or otherwise during the course  \nand within the scope of his employment.  \n240  \n(d) Club medical personnel reasonably suspect that the Player  \nmay suffer from an alcohol use problem.  \n(e) A Player is charged by law enforcement authorities with a  \ncrime involving the use of physical force or violence, includ-  \ning but not limited to, resisting arrest, battery, and assault.  \nAny Player who is referred to the Treatment Board will be evalu-  \nated by the Medical Representatives of the Treatment Board in the  \ncase of an alcohol use problem, or by a neutral expert selected by  \nthe Medical Representatives of the Treatment Board in the case of  \noff-field violence. The purpose of the initial evaluation 1s to deter-  \nmine whether the Player could benefit from a Treatment Program,  \nand if so, the type of Treatment Program that would be most  \neffective for the Player involved.  \nA Player\u2019s participation in any Treatment Program 1s voluntary. A  \nPlayer\u2019s failure to participate in any Treatment Program shall not  \nsubject the Player to discipline. A Player\u2019s referral to the Treat-  \nment Board is not intended to supplant any right a Club or the  \nOffice of the Commissioner may have under the UPC or Basic  \nAgreement to discipline a Player for his conduct, or any potential  \ndefenses of the Player or the MLBPA to such discipline. The  \nPlayer\u2019s participation in any Treatment Program shall be consid-  \nered as a mitigating factor in any discipline imposed by either the  \nClub or the Office of the Commissioner.  \nSincerely,  \nDaniel R.

The purpose of this letter is to  \nmemorialize various understandings that the Parties have reached in  \norder to protect the health and safety of starting pitchers who are  \nelected or selected to an All-Star team and who make a start on the  \nSunday immediately preceding the All-Star Game (a \u201cSunday  \nPitcher\u201d). The provisions of this letter shall apply only to pitchers who  \nstart a game on the Sunday immediately preceding the All-Star Game.  \n1. pitcher who has a bona fide concern relating to his  \nshort-term or long-term fitness to play, may request either directly or  \nthrough his Club any usage restriction that is reasonably necessary to  \naccommodate such concerns (a \u201cUsage Potential  \nUsage Accommodations include, without limitation, an inning(s) limit,  \na limit on the number of batters faced, a pitch limit, availability for  \nextra innings only, or no use at all.

Time spent on the Disabled List in the current season or  \nprior season, if any;  \n247  \nb. Any work-related surgery performed in the previous  \neighteen months, including but not limited to a ulnar col-  \nlateral ligament reconstruction;  \nc.

If a Sunday Pitcher obtains a Usage Accom-  \nmodation directing that he be held from the game entirely, he will be  \nreplaced on the roster but treated in the same manner as other All-Stars  \nwho are excused from participation, and he will also be encouraged to  \nattend and be announced at the All-Star Game.  \n4. For purposes of clarity, this letter supplements and in no way  \nsupersedes the exceptions to mandatory All-Star Game participation in  \nArticle XV(N)(3)(e)(1) of the Basic Agreement.  \nPlease acknowledge your agreement to the above terms by sign-  \ning below.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDaniel R.

They are to be observed by all parties:  \nl.  \nAll accredited press, radio and TV representatives shall have pre-  \ngame access to the clubhouse from three hours and 30 minutes  \nprior to game time until one hour prior to game time, except that:  \n(a) the media shall not have access to the clubhouse when a club  \nis on the field for batting practice; and (b) the media may not  \nreturn to a clubhouse once a club has taken batting practice. The  \nmedia shall have pre-game access to the clubhouse for a minimum  \nof 50 minutes prior to the time that a Club mandates that all play-  \ners take the field for batting practice or other related activities  \n(e.g., stretching). If a Club does not take batting practice, it may  \nnot close the clubhouse until the media has been granted a mini-  \nmum of 50 minutes of access. Unless necessary to satisfy the  \n50-minute requirement, no Club may provide pre-game access  \nprior to three hours and 30 minutes prior to game time. The media  \nshall have access (outside of the clubhouse) to the Club\u2019s man-  \nager, players or coaches after batting practice to discuss newswor-  \nthy events (such as lineup changes, injuries, and workouts) that  \noccur after the clubhouse closes.  \nAbsent unusual circumstances that require a team meeting imme-  \ndiately following a game, the working media shall have access to  \nboth clubhouses no later than 10 minutes following the final out  \nof each game (including doubleheaders and day/night split admis-  \nsion games). When such unusual circumstances exist, and such  \ninstances are expected to be rare, the working media shall have  \naccess to the clubhouse no later than 20 minutes following the  \nfinal out of the game. The Commissioner\u2019s Office reserves the  \nright to require access to the clubhouse 10 minutes following the  \nfinal out of all games if the \u201cteam meeting\u201d exception is abused.  \n  \nThe working media\u2019s access following a game shall be for a  \nperiod no longer than one hour unless reasonable access to play-  \ners 1s not provided during that time; provided, however, that card-  \ncarrying members of the Baseball Writers Association of America  \n(\u201cBBWAA\u201d) will have unlimited access after the post-game open-  \ning of the clubhouse. If reasonable access is not provided, the  \nclubhouse must remain open. Members of the media, other than  \nBBWAA members, may make arrangements with the club PR  \nDirector for extended access.  \nMedia credentials are not transferable.  \nClubhouses, the dugouts and the field are off-limits except to  \nappropriate club, Commissioner\u2019s Office personnel and media  \nbearing appropriate credentials. Club credentials are not to be  \nissued to unauthorized personnel. The Commissioner\u2019s Office  \nreserves the right to revoke inappropriately issued credentials.  \nPlayers will be available to the media before and after games for  \ninterviews. These periods should not be limited except for the pre-  \ngame period described in #1 above, and the post-game period  \ndescribed in #2, above. Upon request by the media, players who  \nhad key roles in the first game of a doubleheader are to be made  \navailable for a time between games.  \nThe trainer\u2019s room and players\u2019 lounge may be off-limits to the  \nmedia, but each club controls these areas, and it is vital these areas  \nnot be used as a sanctuary for players seeking to avoid the media.  \nIt is very important to our game that ALL players are available to  \nthe media for reasonable periods and it is the player\u2019s responsibil-  \nity to cooperate.  \nRopes or other restraining barriers are not permitted to bar the  \nmedia.  \nA general code is to be observed by the media so uniformed per-  \nsonnel may do their work unimpeded. Media are to be allowed in  \nfoul territory, in an unrestricted manner, in an area that is to be not  \nless than the territory between first and third bases, and which ter-  \nritory includes the area around the batting cage, except the dirt  \narea around the batting cage.  \n253  \n10.  \n11.  \n12.  \n13.  \n14.  \nUnder no circumstances shall any club discriminate in any fash-  \nion against an accredited member of the media based upon race,  \ncreed, sex or national origin.  \nPhysical abuse or threats directed to members of the media  \n(and/or official scorers) by baseball personnel will not be toler-  \nated. Disciplinary action, including fines and suspensions, will be  \nconsidered in any cases that arise. While in the clubhouse, mem-  \nbers of the media are expected to be doing business. Members of  \nthe media are expected to conduct themselves in a professional  \nmanner and to respect the privileges and environment of restricted  \nareas and working press areas at all times. Any media member in  \nviolation of this conduct policy is subject to revocation of his or  \nher privileges and may be subject to immediate ejection.  \nVisitors in the clubhouse, including accredited media members,  \nshould conduct themselves in a professional manner. There shall  \nbe no seeking of autographs, no touching or removing of equip-  \nment or personal items from lockers, and no sampling of players\u2019  \nfood spreads. Clubhouses are work places. Clubhouse business  \nshould be conducted as expeditiously as possible with a minimum  \nof disruption of regular game routines. Members of the media  \nshould not excessively linger in the clubhouse when not inter-  \nviewing players. Members of the media who violate the code of  \nconduct set forth in this paragraph shall be subject to sanctions,  \nincluding the loss of their accreditation as provided for in para-  \ngraph 17 below.  \nLive TV and/or radio interviews with uniformed personnel during  \nthe course of a game are not authorized or permitted, nor is attach-  \ning a microphone to any uniformed personnel permitted without  \napproval from the Commissioner\u2019s Office. Microphones may not  \nbe placed in or adjacent to dugouts and/or bullpens in a manner  \nthat will allow uniformed personnel\u2019s remarks or conversations to  \nbe overheard during the course of a game without the prior  \napproval of the Commissioner\u2019s Office.  \n   \nLive telephone interviews are not allowed from the clubhouse or  \nthe field without prior approval of the club. Mobile telephones  \nwith digital photography capabilities are prohibited.  \n254  \n15.  \n16.  \n17.  \nTelephones from both dugouts to the press box are to be main-  \ntained in working order for the purpose of providing information  \nregarding special circumstances to the media during the course of  \na game. Explanations of injuries should be made as soon as pos-  \nsible (to both the media and fans in the stadium).  \nBBWAA members are not required to sign in for clubhouse or  \nother restricted area access but may be logged in by club person-  \nnel, subject to individual club policies. Other accredited media  \nmay be required to sign in for clubhouse access, subject to indi-  \nvidual club policies.  \nAny club whose personnel violate these regulations will be disci-  \nplined. Any member of the media who violates these regulations  \nwill lose his or her accreditation.  \nH # #  \n255  \nATTACHMENT 35  \nTony C. Clark  \nExecutive Director  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nDear Tony:  \nThis letter memorializes certain understandings that the Parties have  \nreached during the negotiations over a successor to the 2012\u20142016  \nBasic Agreement. This letter shall be admissible in any arbitration  \nhearing involving an issue addressed herein.  \nA Club has the right under Regulation 2 of the Uniform Player\u2019s Con-  \ntract (\u201cUPC\u2019\u2019) to designate the doctors and hospitals furnishing medical  \ncare and hospital services to a Player for injuries sustained in the course  \nand within the scope of his employment under his UPC. A Player is  \nentitled under Article XIII(D) of the Basic Agreement to go to a doctor  \non the second medical opinion list for diagnosis and a second medical  \nevaluation of an employment related illness or injury being treated by  \nthe Club physician. The Parties have had a disagreement regarding Club  \nand Player rights when a second medical opinion doctor and a Club  \nphysician disagree on the appropriate course of treatment for a Player\u2019s  \nemployment-related injury, including but not limited to disagreement  \nover whether medical procedures not yet approved by the United States  \nFood and Drug Administration qualify as \u201creasonable medical  \nexpenses\u201d under Regulation 2 of the UPC. Without attempting to  \nresolve this disagreement, the Parties will continue to attempt to avoid  \ndisputes that might otherwise arise between Players and Clubs in this  \narea by, among other things, urging their constituents to agree upon a  \nqualified third physician expert in the appropriate medical specialty  \nwho would resolve the dispute between the Club physician and the sec-  \nond medical opinion doctor as to the appropriate course of treatment.  \nThere have been other circumstances in which the Club physician and  \na Player\u2019s second medical opinion doctor agree that a particular sur-  \ngery is the appropriate course of treatment but the Player and Club dis-  \nagree as to who should perform the surgery. While the Club has the  \nright to designate the doctors and hospitals when a Player is undergo-  \n256  \ning a surgery for an employment related injury, the Clubs understand  \nthe importance of a Player being comfortable with the physician per-  \nforming any such surgery. As a result, the Office of the Commissioner  \nwill continue to advise Clubs that they should take a Player\u2019s reason-  \nable preferences into account when designating doctors to perform sur-  \ngery under Regulation 2. As part of this commitment, the Office of the  \nCommissioner will advise the Clubs that in no event should they force  \na Player to have a surgery performed by the Club physician but should  \ninstead, in any case in which a Player has objected to the surgery being  \nperformed by the Club physician, designate another physician to per-  \nform the surgery.  \nFinally, disputes have also arisen with respect to which travel costs are  \nappropriately considered part of the \u201creasonable medical expenses\u201d for  \nwhich a Club is responsible under Regulation 2 of the UPC. The par-  \nties agree that for any surgical procedure, medical exam or other sim-  \nilar medical appointment conducted under Regulation 2, the Club shall  \nbe obligated to provide or reimburse first-class airfare for the player\u2019s  \ncompanion, but only when travel with a companion has been recom-  \nmended by a treating physician. In addition, the Office of the Commis-  \nsioner recognizes that \u201creasonable medical expenses\u201d include actual  \nand reasonable travel costs associated with required follow-up exami-  \nnation(s) with the surgeon who performed covered surgery, and the  \nAssociation, on the other hand, recognizes that \u201creasonable medical  \nexpenses\u201d would not include travel costs incurred by a Player to see a  \ndoctor for routine examination(s) that could have been appropriately  \nperformed by a local doctor designated by the Club.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDaniel R.

Prouty, Esquire  \nGeneral Counsel  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nDear David:  \nThis letter will memorialize our agreement regarding the assessment  \nand management of concussions suffered by Major League Players.  \n1. The following protocols will govern the assessment and manage-  \nment of concussions by each Club\u2019s medical staff:  \nA. All Players will undergo neurocognitive baseline testing dur-  \nB.  \ning Spring Training or when they join a Club each season.  \nIf a Player is involved in an incident during a game that is  \nassociated with a high risk of concussion, the game will be  \nstopped and the Player will be evaluated on the field for a  \npotential concussion by a Certified Athletic Trainer (\u201cATC\u2019\u2019)  \nfollowing the National Athletic Trainers\u2019 Association  \n(\u201cNATA\u201d\u2019) guidelines for management of sports-related con-  \ncussions.  \nIf the ATC detects any sign and/or symptom of a concussion  \nduring an on-field evaluation, the Player will be removed  \nfrom the game and brought to the clubhouse for further eval-  \nuation.  \ni. A Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (\u201cSCAT3\u2019)  \nassessment will be performed in the clubhouse by the  \nATC and/or the Club Physician to determine if a concus-  \nsion has occurred. A copy of the SCAT3 form, which  \nmust be completed during the assessment, is attached  \nhereto as Exhibit A.  \nu. If the SCAT3 assessment determines that a concussion  \nhas not occurred, serial examinations will be performed  \nbetween innings for the remainder of the game. If the  \nSCAT3 assessment determines that a concussion has  \noccurred, the Club, in consultation with the ATC and the  \n258  \nClub Physician, will determine if the concussed Player  \nshould be placed on a Disabled List (\u201cDL\u201d), and if so,  \nwhich one.  \nD. Ifthe ATC does not detect any sign and/or symptom of a con-  \ncussion during the on-field evaluation, the Player may  \nremain in the game, but serial examinations should be per-  \nformed between innings for the remainder of the game. Any  \nchange in the Player\u2019s neurological status will result in  \nimmediate removal from the game and further evaluation in  \nthe clubhouse.  \nThe Parties will establish a 7-day DL solely for the placement of  \nPlayers who suffer a concussion. The following protocols will  \ngovern the placement of a concussed Player on the 7-day DL:  \nA. Players are eligible for the 7-day DL only if they suffer an  \nacute concussion.  \nB. The occurrence of the injury, including all of the relevant  \ndetails, must be documented through an Event Form in the  \nElectronic Medical Records System.  \nC. In lieu of a Standard Form of Diagnosis, which is required to  \nplace a Player on the DL under Article XIII(C) of the Basic  \nAgreement, the ATC and the Club Physician will prepare and  \nsubmit simultaneously to the Office of the Commissioner and  \nthe Players Association a concussion-specific diagnostic form  \nthat includes the following information: (1) the date and mech-  \nanism of the injury; (11) the signs and symptoms of impair-  \nment; (iii) confirmation that a SCAT3 assessment was  \nperformed by an ATC and/or a Club Physician, and that the  \nassessment indicated a concussion had occurred; and (iv) the  \nbasis for diagnosis of a concussion. Copies of the concussion-  \nspecific diagnostic forms for 7-day and 10-day DL place-  \nments are attached hereto as Exhibits B and C, respectively.  \nD. The concussion-specific diagnostic form and any supporting  \ninformation (including, but not limited to, the completed  \nSCAT3 form) must be submitted to 7dayDL@mlb.com, and  \nthe Players Association must confirm receipt in writing  \n(which it will do promptly), before the Player may be placed  \non the 7-day DL. MLB\u2019s Medical Director will review the  \n259  \ninformation as soon as it is received, and inform the Com-  \nmissioner\u2019s Office if the 7-day DL placement is approved.  \nThe Commissioner\u2019s Office will then simultaneously  \ninform the Players Association and the Club of the approval  \nand enter the 7-day DL placement into eBis. If the Medical  \nDirector or the MLBPA expert questions whether the Player  \nqualifies for the 7-day DL, they shall consult with each  \nother as well as one of the outside experts on the Commit-  \ntee prior to making his decision. In the event the Medical  \nDirector and the MLBPA expert are unable to agree on the  \napproval of the 7-day DL placement, they shall refer the  \nmatter to an independent expert selected by the Parties, who  \nwill determine in his sole discretion whether the placement  \nshould be approved.  \nExcept for rehabilitation assignments as described in Para-  \ngraph 2(F) below, a Player placed on the 7-day DL will be  \ntreated the same as a Player placed on the 10-day DL for all  \npurposes, including roster limits, transfers to the 60-day DL,  \netc. Ifa concussed Player is not able to return to play in seven  \ndays, the Player may be recertified for a subsequent place-  \nment on the 7-day DL. Any Player on the 7-day DL for more  \nthan 9 days will be transferred automatically and retro-  \nactively to the 10-day DL, effective with the first day of the  \ninitial placement, and with the prior 9 days applying to the  \ninitial 10-day minimum period.  \nA concussed Player on the 7-day DL who has been cleared to  \nreturn to play may then consent to an assignment to a Minor  \nLeague affiliate of his Club under the terms of Article  \nXIX(C)(3), except that such assignment shall not exceed five  \n(5) days for non-pitchers and eight (8) days for pitchers,  \nunless the Player is not able to return to play within 14 days  \nof the initial 7-day placement, in which case the maximum  \nperiods shall be 20 and 30 days, respectively.  \nIf the Club, in consultation with the ATC and the Club Physician,  \ndecides to place a Player on the 10-day or 60-day DL for a concus-  \nsion, the Club must prepare and submit simultaneously to the  \nOffice of the Commissioner and the Players Association the con-  \ncussion-specific diagnostic form rather than the Standard Form of  \n260  \nDiagnosis that is required under Article XIII(C) of the Basic  \nAgreement. However, a Club may place a Player on the 10-day or  \n60-day DL for a concussion without the prior approval of the Com-  \nmissioner\u2019s Office that is required for placement on the 7-day DL.  \nBefore any Player that has suffered a concussion is permitted to  \nreturn to play in any game, regardless of whether the Player was  \npreviously placed on a DL for such injury, the Club must submit  \na \u201cReturn to Play\u201d form and the supporting certifications and doc-  \nument referenced below, to MLB\u2019s Medical Director and the Play-  \ners Association, and the Players Association must confirm receipt  \nin writing (which it will do promptly). The Return to Play Form,  \na copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D, must contain the  \nfollowing certifications by the Club Physician and the ATC: (1) all  \nsymptoms have resolved; (11) ImPACT testing has returned to  \nrange of baseline; (111) the Player experienced no symptoms with  \nexertion and baseball-related activities; (iv) the SCAT3 is within  \nnormal limits; and (v) the Club Physician has cleared the Player  \nto participate in baseball activities. The Return to Play form must  \nalso be accompanied by the documentation supporting these cer-  \ntifications, including, but not limited to, copies of all ImPACT and  \nSCATS3 tests (including the SCAT3 from the time of injury), the  \ncurrent neurocognitive test score, the baseline neurocognitive test  \nscores, and any reports by the Club Physician and the ATC.  \nIf the Medical Director or the MLBPA expert questions whether  \nthe Player should be returned to play, they shall consult with each  \nother as well as one of the outside experts on the Committee prior  \nto making a decision. In addition, the Medical Director may direct  \nthe Club to have the Player evaluated by an MLB-approved MTBI  \nspecialist in the Club\u2019s home city before the Player is permitted to  \nreturn to play. In the event the Medical Director and the MLBPA  \nexpert are unable to agree on the Player\u2019s return to play, they shall  \nrefer the matter to an independent expert selected by the Parties,  \nwho will determine in his sole discretion whether the Player  \nshould return to play.  \nThe Commissioner\u2019s Office will conduct an orientation for Club  \nmedical staffs regarding the protocols described herein, and will  \narrange training and education sessions for Club personnel  \nthroughout the course of the season and during the off-season, in  \n261  \nwhich Players Association officials may participate. Club person-  \nnel will also be advised of concussion-related continuing education  \nsessions conducted by the NATA and other national organizations.  \nFinally, the Commissioner\u2019s Office and the Players Association  \nwill jointly create and distribute educational materials for Players  \non the assessment and management of concussions, including a  \nConcussion Information Sheet and a joint memorandum.  \nThis agreement shall constitute an \u201cagreement\u201d within the mean-  \ning of Article XI(A)(1)(a) of the Basic Agreement. In the event a  \nGrievance is filed pursuant to Article XI of the Basic Agreement  \nalleging non-compliance with the terms of this agreement, the  \nClub, the Player involved, the Commissioner\u2019s Office and the  \nPlayers Association will cooperate in scheduling the handling of  \nsuch Grievance so that it may be submitted to arbitration on an  \nexpedited basis, consistent with the procedures in Article XI gov-  \nerning grievances involving Player safety and health.  \nThe Parties will mutually agree upon a report to be compiled  \nannually by the epidemiologist that will provide a summary of  \nconcussion activity for the preceding season, including the num-  \nber of events, the circumstances attendant thereto, and the results  \nof any treatment programs. Within 30 days of the issuance of the  \nreport, the Parties shall meet to discuss the report\u2019s contents and  \nto review the functioning of the protocols and procedures estab-  \nlished by this agreement.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDaniel R.

Prouty, Esquire  \nGeneral Counsel  \nMajor League Baseball  \nPlayers Association  \n12 East 49th Street  \nNew York, New York 10017  \nDear David:  \nThis letter will memorialize our agreement on \u201cmini-camps.\u201d  \n1.  \nMini-camps shall be limited to workouts and activities designed  \nto acclimate players to a Major League clubhouse (e.g., seminars  \non handling the media, team-building exercises, casual group  \nactivities, etc.). Clubs may not negotiate or attempt to negotiate  \ndirectly with a Player his salary or other terms of a Uniform  \nPlayer\u2019s Contract (\u201cUPC\u2019\u2019) during a mini-camp.  \nClubs may hold mini-camps that include 40-man roster Players  \nfor no more than seven days during the month of January. The  \nmini-camp must be located at the Club\u2019s Spring Training facility or  \nin the Club\u2019s home city and must be completed before February 1.  \nThe only 40-man roster Players who may be invited to attend a  \nmini-camp are those with less than three years of Major League  \nservice who also are not eligible for salary arbitration that year  \n(\u201cEligible Invitees\u201d). No more than 15 Eligible Invitees may be  \ninvited to a Club\u2019s mini-camp.  \nAttendance by 40-man roster Players at a Club\u2019s mini-camp 1s  \npurely voluntary. The Parties acknowledge that it is essential to  \nthis agreement that Clubs refrain from any activity which suggests  \nthat invitations to mini-camps are anything less than entirely up to  \nthe Player. There will be no consequences to an Eligible Invitee if  \nhe decides not to attend.  \nOn or before December 15, the Club must identify for the Office  \nof the Commissioner any 40-man roster Players that the Club  \nwishes to invite to attend mini-camp in January. The Office of the  \nCommissioner, in turn, will inform the Association of which  \nClubs intend to conduct mini-camps and identify any 40-man  \nroster invitees.  \nZid  \nAll invitations sent to 40-man roster Players to a Club\u2019s mini-  \ncamp must come exclusively through the Office of the Commis-  \nsioner in the form of the following standard invitation letter, a  \ncopy of which shall be provided to the Players Association con-  \ntemporaneously with the invitation to the Player:  \nOn behalf of the Club, you are hereby invited to attend a  \nmini-camp that the Club will hold at the following dates,  \ntimes and locations. First-class jet air and hotel accommoda-  \ntions, if practicable, will be provided. Please be advised that,  \npursuant to Attachment 37 of the Basic Agreement between  \nthe 30 Major League Clubs and the Major League Baseball  \nPlayers Association, attendance at this mini-camp is purely  \nvoluntary. There will be absolutely no consequences if you  \ndecide not to attend.  \nPlease let me know by January 1 whether you plan to attend the  \nmini-camp. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  \nClubs may not follow-up on the invitation of a 40-man Player  \neither in writing or verbally, or either directly or indirectly (e.g.,  \nthrough an agent). The Office of the Commissioner will coordi-  \nnate any logistical follow-up that is necessary. However, if a  \nPlayer responds directly to the Club rather than the Commis-  \nsioner\u2019s Office, the Club may then proceed to coordinate travel  \nplans and inform the Player of any other pertinent details.  \nNothing herein is intended to restrict or otherwise modify a Club\u2019s  \nrights under Regulation 2 to prescribe or direct treatment for, or  \notherwise follow-up on the health or medical condition of, an  \ninjured player during the off-season.  \nSincerely,  \nDaniel R.

Nothing in this agreement is intended to  \nrestrict Club or Commissioner\u2019s Office policies encouraging the  \nuse of Social Media.  \nA Player may be disciplined by either the Commissioner or his  \nClub for a violation of the Policy, but not by both for the same  \nconduct. All discipline under the Policy by a Club or the Com-  \nmissioner must be for just cause in accordance with Article XII  \nof the Basic Agreement. In any grievance involving the disci-  \npline of a Player for an alleged violation of the Policy, the Asso-  \nciation agrees it will not challenge the reasonableness of the  \napplicable aspect(s) of the Policy involved, but reserves all of its  \nother defenses in any such grievance, including the right to  \nassert that the amount of discipline imposed is not supported by  \njust cause.  \nThis agreement shall not be used by either party as precedent or  \nin support of its position in any proceeding or dispute other than  \na proceeding involving an alleged violation of its terms. More-  \nover, this agreement and the Policy itself (including the defini-  \n276  \ntions therein) shall not be cited and shall have no consequence in  \nany negotiation or business transaction involving the Parties.  \nVery truly yours,  \nDavid M.
