The names of all  \nsubcontractors shall be furnished to the Union at such conference if known by the contractor at that time;  \nand in any event the names of such subcontractors shall be furn shed to the Union before said subcontractors  \nshall commence work.

On projects of less  \nthan one million dollars ($1,000,000) the Employer shall notify the Union, having jurisdiction on the project,  \nprior to commencing work of manpower requirements and subccntractors who will be on the project.  \n(B) The Employer will, when requesting referrals from the local union (1) specify the number of employees  \nrequired; (2) the location of the project; (3) the nature and type of construction involved; (4) the work to be  \nperformed; and (5) such other information as is deemed essential by the Employer in order to enable the  \nUnion to make proper referrai of applicants.  \n(C) Subject only to the rights of the Employer to employ and transfer men under Section 2 of this Article, the  \nEmployer shail not employ workmen, either to start a new job or to replace a workman or fill a new position  \non a in progress without first calling the appropriate Union o'fice or representative and requesting a  \nreferral of applicants for the job or jobs available.

The Union shall fill the Employer's  \nrequest for men qualified to perform work involved as soon as pussible.  \n(D) If the Union fails for any reason to refer applicants within twent:-four (24) hours, the Employer may secure  \nsuch workmen from any source available to him.  \n(E) The Employer shall have the right to accept or reject any applicant for employment.  \n(F) The Union shall select and refer applicants for employment with ut discrimination against such applicants by  \nreason of membership or non-membership in the Union, and such selection and referral shal! not be affected  \nin any way by rules, bylaws, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect or obligation of union  \nmembership, policies or requirements.  \n(G} Nothing contained herein shal! deny the Union the right to selec: any applicant for referral on the basis of  \nexperience in the industry, qualification, skill, or the Employer's preference regardless of the employee's place  \non the out-of-work list. The local Union shail refer workmen cal ed for by name if such workmen are properly  \nregistered and available and have been previously laid off or termninated in the area covered by this  \nAgreement or covered by the Agreements of the Builders\u2019 Association of Missouri or the Associated General  \nContractors of St. Louis.  \nAGC-MO/Carpenter Agreement \u201c+  \n4.2. The Unions, recognizing that the success and efficiency of every Contractor organization in the construction  \nindustry depends in large measure on the availability to them of certain men who are skilled in the various crafts and classi-  \nfications, and who have known abilities to work in harmony and help organize an efficient crew, agree as follows:  \n(A} Without regard for any of the limitations imposed by the preceding Section 1 of this Article, the Employer  \nmay bring in to any job from any place or Union jurisdiction the first and aii other odd numbers of the crew.  \n(B) There shail be no restrictions on the transfer of men from one job site to another within the jurisdictional  \narea of the same Carpenter District Council or the same local Union where no Council has jurisdiction.  \n4.3.

The failure of any person to become a  \nmember of the Union at such required times shail obligate the Employer, upon writzen notice from the Union to such effect and  \nto the further effect that Union membership was available to such person on the seme terms and conditions available  \nto other members, to forthwith discharge such person.
