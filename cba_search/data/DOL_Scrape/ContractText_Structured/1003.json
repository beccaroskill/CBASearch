The names of all subcontractors shall  \nbe furnished to the Unian at such conference if known by  \nthe contractor at that time; and in any event the names of  \nsuch subcontractors shal! be furnished to the Union before  \nsaid subcontractors shall commence work. The Employer  \nvill then outline his initial and prospective manpower  \nrequirements in all the various crafis and classificatione,  \nand the Union will inform the Emptoyer of the probable  \nnumber and qualifications of the men they will have  \navailable to meet the Employer's requirements.

The Unions, recognizing that the success and  \nefficiency of every contractor Organization in the construction industry  \ndepends in large measure on the availability to them of certain men  \nwho are skilled in the various Crafts and classifications, and who have  \nknown abilities to work in harmony and help organize an efficient  \ncrew, agree as follows:  \nWithout regard for any of the limitations imposed by the  \npreceding Section 1 of this Article, the first (1st) and third (3rd)  \nlaborer employed by the Employer on the job shall be from the Local  \nUnion having jurisdiction on the. job.

Furthermore, the Unions agree to give due consideration  \nto any Employer's request for the first workman or additional laborers  \nconsistent with the purpose of this Section. Laborers outside the  \nLocal Union furnished by the Employer shall be required to register  \nwith the Local Union Office Prior to employment on ithe job site.  \nWorking foremen who are part of the bargaining unit will be employed  \nin the order, and counted as part of the total work force, as  \naforementioned.

However, no strike shall be called authorized  \nby a decision of the appropriate District Councif or authorized  \nrepresentatives of the Council and after at least a forty-eight (48) hour  \nnotice excluding Saturday and Sunday of intention to strike given by  \nthe District Council to both the Employer's main office and the office  \nof the Associated General Contractors of Missouri in Jefferson City,  \nMO.  \nSection 4. Should any Employer refuse to employ an applicant  \nretarred by the Union under the above provisions and such refusal is  \nnot for a good and just cause, then the Union may ask far arbitration.  \n{f so, the same arbitration procedure shall be followed as is set out in  \nArticle XII of this Agreement. If the Unions win such arbitration, the  \napplicant refused employment shalf be made whole by the Employer  \nfar all losses suffered and shall be put to work on the job if the jab he  \nwas referred to stil! exists.  \nSection 6.
