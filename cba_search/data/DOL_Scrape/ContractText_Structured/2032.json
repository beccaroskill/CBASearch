The normal workday will be eight (8) hours.  \nAn employee will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times her/his regular rate  \nof pay for hours worked in excess of eighty (80) hours during the said two (2) week  \nperiod, or in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday.

Overtime payments shall not be duplicated for hours worked in excess of  \neight (8) in a regular workday and in excess of eighty (80) in a two-week work period or  \nin excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours. Paid sick leave, holidays, and vacation hours  \nShall be considered as hours of work for overtime purposes.  \nThe Hospital and Union may mutually agree to overtime payments at the rate set forth  \nabove on the basis of time worked in excess of forty (40) hours during any one (1) week  \n[seven (7) consecutive days]. If such method of payment is used, no overtime shall be  \npaid for time worked in excess of eight (8) hours during a workday.  \nAn employee who is called to work an unscheduled shift and who is called not later than  \none-half (1/2) hour after the commencement of that shift shall be paid for the entire shift  \nif she/he arrives within a reasonable period of time after being called.  \nAdditional intermittent hours shall be first offered to regularly scheduled part-time  \nPharmacists based on seniority, before any outside agency is used.  \nAdditional hours shall be offered to the most senior Pharmacists on duty at the time the  \nhours are needed, after the Hospital has exercised its option to offer the hours to part-time  \nor casual employees. The senior Pharmacists shall have the night to refuse such  \nadditional hours. In that instance, they shall be offered by seniority and in the event no  \none wants them, the hours shall be assigned to the least senior qualified Pharmacist on  \n6  \n4.9  \n4.6  \n4.7.  \n4.8  \nduty. However, no one shall be required to work more than two (2) consecutive shifts  \nnot to exceed 19 hours without mutual consent except in emergency situations.  \nSchedules shall be posted at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the  \nPharmacist\u2019s scheduled work and that schedule shall reflect four (4) weeks of scheduled  \nhours. Changes in posted schedules will not be made without notification and mutual  \nconsent to the Pharmacists affected. Changes to work assignments or work locations  \nmay be made without mutual consent so long as no work hours are changed.  \nIn the establishment of new work week schedules (including fewer weekends, fewer  \nholiday shifts, opportunities for straight shifts, or changes in shift times of greater than 2  \nhours) the Hospitals shall give preference to qualified employees in accordance with  \nseniority.  \nChanging Time: Each pharmacist who is required to change clothing on premises into  \nhospital owned apparel has seven (7) minutes or other mutually agreed upon time with  \npay after the start of the shift to change and report to his or her work area and may leave  \nhis or her work area seven (7) minutes or other mutually agreed upon time with pay  \nbefore the shift ends to change out of hospital owned apparel.  \nAlternative Weekend Schedule: The Hospital may establish flexible scheduling plans  \nproviding work schedules of only two (2) 12-hour shifts every weekend. An employee  \nmay agree to work additional shifts; but such agreement shall not be a condition of being  \naccepted for available Alternative Weekend Schedules. Plans established under this  \nsection 4.7 shall be subject to the following conditions:  \nA. Alternative Weekend Schedules developed under this program shall be within a  \nforty-eight (48) consecutive hours period between 7:00 p.m. on Friday and 7:00  \na.m. on the following Monday.  \nB. An employee electing this program will be scheduled to work two (2) 12-hour  \nshifts on consecutive days during the forty-eight (48) hour period on every  \nweekend. The employee will receive thirty-six (36) hours of pay at the  \nregular rate of pay for this twenty-four (24) hours of work.  \nC. An employee working two (2) 12-hour weekend shifts on an Altemative  \nWeekend Schedule shall be credited with thirty-six (36) hours per weekend  \n[seventy-two (72) hours per payroll period] toward accumulation of all  \ncontractually provided benefits, including pension and seniority. An employee  \nwill receive one (1) hour of credit toward benefits for each additional hour the  \nemployee agrees to work.  \nD. Vacation and sick leave used shall be paid and be deducted from the employee\u2019 s  \naccumulated vacation and sick leave at the same rate as it is accrued. An  \nemployee will, therefore, receive eighteen (18) hours of pay for each twelve (12)  \nhour weekend shift taken as vacation or sick leave.  \n4.9  \nAn employee electing an Alternative Weekend Schedule may be scheduled to  \nwork on each holiday falling on a weekend.  \nHoliday pay shall be based on the number of hours regularly scheduled under the  \nAlternative Weekend Program.  \nArticle 6 (Shift Differential, Weekend Bonus, and Lead Pay) relating to shift  \ndifferentials, weekend bonus, and weekend premiums shall not apply to the two  \n(2) 12- hour shifts for which an employee is normally scheduled; but will apply to  \nany additional weekend shifts an employee agrees to work.  \nThe basic work week for employees on the Alternative Weekend Program shall  \nbe forty (40) hours per week. An employee shall be paid at rate of one and  \none-half (I 1/2) times his/her base regular rate for all hours worked in excess of  \nforty (40) hours per week. An employee working in excess of her/his scheduled  \nwork day shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular  \nbase rate for all hours worked in excess of his/her scheduled shift, except that  \nhours in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours in a work day shall be paid at the  \nrate of double time.  \nEmployees on the Alternative Weekend Program may elect permanent assignment  \nto the night shift. The remaining night shifts shall be shared proportionately by  \nemployees electing to work twelve (12) hour shifts on weekends under this  \nProgram.  \nAn employee may revoke her or his consent to an alternative weekend schedule  \npursuant to this program by giving written notice. The employee shall be entitled  \nto return to an open available position for which the employee is qualified and  \nwhich has an equal number of hours per payroll period as the employee had prior  \nto electing the Alternative Weekend Program. The Hospital shall likewise give  \nthe employee notice of equal length in the event the Alternative Weekend  \nProgram was discontinued.  \nAn employee participating in this Alternative Weekend Program may, with  \nHospital approval, trade hours with an employee who is not on an Alternative  \nWeekend Schedule. Each employee involved in the trade will be paid at that  \nemployee's regular rate of pay excluding the Altemative Weekend Schedule  \nPremium and in accordance with that standard for overtime eligibility.  \nAn employee on an Altemative Weekend Schedule who trades hours with another  \nemployee who is scheduled to work a twelve (12) hour shift between 7:00 p.m. on  \nFriday and 7:00 a.m. on the following Monday shall continue to receive pay as set  \nforth in this Section. An employee who agrees to work a scheduled shift for an  \nemployee on an Alternative Weekend Schedule shall be paid at the rate of pay the  \nemployee would otherwise receive for weekend work.  \n7-O n/7-O ff Schedules:  \nThe work schedule will consist of seven (7) consecutive shifts of work and seven  \n(7) consecutive shifts when the employee will not be scheduled.  \nEach shift will be ten (10) hours in length.  \nThe employee will work a total of seventy (70) hours in a two week pay period and  \nwill receive pay for eighty (80) hours (i.e., sixty (60) hours at straight time, ten  \n(10) hours at time and one-half plus five (5) additional hours (WWP)).  \n(1) In one of the payroll weeks of the employee\u2019s schedule, he/she will work  \nfifty (50) hours. Anything in excess of forty (40) hours will be paid at the  \novertime rate of one and one-half the employee\u2019s hourly rate.  \n(2) In the other payroll week of the employee\u2019s schedule, he/she will work  \ntwenty (20) hours. If the department manager requests the employee to  \nwork any additional hours beyond the twenty (20) hours in the work week,  \nthe employee will be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half the  \nemployee\u2019s hourly rate. (Assuming the employee worked his/her full  \nschedule the previous week.)  \n(3) If the employee voluntarily trades with another employee for additional  \nhours during the twenty (20) hour week, he/she will be paid at his/her  \nregular hourly rate. (Trading shifts is okay if it does not result in  \novertime.)  \n(4) If the employee\u2019s hours exceed forty (40) in either week, he/she will be  \neligible for overtime. Overtime will also be paid if the employee exceeds  \nten (10) hours of work in one day. Double time will be paid for hours  \nexceeding twelve (12) in one day.  \nBecause of the favorable compensation benefit, vacation will not be earned or  \naccrued once the employee is on this schedule. Vacation time that is accrued and  \nunused at the time a pharmacist begins the 7-on and 7-off schedule will be frozen.  \nWhile on this schedule, a pharmacist may only use frozen vacation time during  \napproved unpaid leaves of absence. The unpaid leaves of absence for which  \nfrozen vacation time may be used does not include the seven uncompensated days  \noff provided for in this Section. The pharmacist must request to use frozen  \nvacation time during the leave of absence with the request for the leave. If a  \npharmacist discontinues the 7/70 schedule for any reason (e.g., moving to an 8/80  \nposition or separating employment), the frozen vacation time will be unfrozen.  \nEligible pharmacists upon reaching the five year step and above, will receive an  \nannual bonus calculated at (FTE) x (rate of pay) x (40 hours). It shall be paid  \nupon the request of the pharmacist. To be eligible for this benefit, pharmacists  \nmust be scheduled to work 7-on and 7-off and must be employed at Allina  \nHospitals and Clinics as a pharmacist for a minimum of 5 years.  \nAn eligible pharmacist upon reaching the 10 year step, will receive an annual  \nbonus calculated at (FTE) x (rate of pay) x (80 hours) paid upon request. To be  \neligible for this benefit pharmacist must be scheduled to work 7-on and 7-off and  \nmust be employed at A llina Hospitals and Clinics as a pharmacist for a minimum  \nof 10 years.  \nTime off will have to have the approval of the department management. Up to  \nseven (7) days of uncompensated time off per calendar year will be granted at a  \nmutually agreed upon time between department management and the Pharmacist.  \nThe employee will not be asked to find his/her own replacement for these hours if  \na request is submitted for this unpaid leave of absence in accordance with the  \nguidelines for requesting vacation and Section 8.5 of this A greement.  \nA pharmacist may request days off in addition to the seven days described in the  \npreceding paragraph. However, there is no guarantee that the request will be  \ngranted by the Hospital. Additionally, if an 8/80 employee requests the same time  \nfor vacation, the 8/80 employee will have preference.  \nPharmacists working this schedule will be required to work all holidays that will  \nfall during their 7-on shifts.  \n(1) If an employee works a ten (10) hour shift on a holiday, he/she will be paid  \nten (10) hours regular pay plus ten (10) hours of holiday pay. Any hours  \nexceeding the ten (10) scheduled hours will be paid at the appropriate  \novertime rate.  \n(2) An employee who does not work the holiday will have ten (10) hours of  \nholiday pay added to his/her pay.  \n(3) | During the thirty-two (32) hour Christmas and Thanksgiving holiday  \nperiod, the Pharmacist will be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2)  \nhis/her base rate for all hours worked and will receive ten (10) hours of  \nholiday pay for one (1) shift during the thirty-two (32) hour holiday period.  \nSick leave will be accrued at a rate of eight (8) hours for every 173.33 hours paid.  \nIf the employee is ill and misses a full ten (10) hour shift, he/she will be entitled to  \nten (10) hours of sick leave if he/she has accrued ten (10) hours.  \nFor each pay period that a full-time Pharmacist is on a medical leave of absence  \n(MLOA), he/she will receive eighty (80) hours of pay when using seventy (70)  \nhours of accrued sick leave.  \nLong-term disability insurance will be offered as per the terms of the  \nfor full-time Pharmacists.  \nFuneral leave will be granted and paid as per the A greement.  \nSeniority will be based on the hours for which the employee is actually  \ncompensated, including sick leave. This means the employee will receive eighty  \n10  \n4.10  \n0.1  \n0.2  \n9.3  \n(80) hours of seniority even though he/she is only working seventy (70) hours  \n(assuming the employee works his/her full schedule during the pay period).  \nThe employee will be classified as a regular full-time employee.  \nIn the event the Hospital desires to revoke this agreement and revert back to  \nArticle 4.1 of the Agreement, a minimum of ninety (90) days will be given to the  \nPharmacist to revert to an 8/80 position with scheduling per seniority.  \nThe Pharmacist will be given a copy of this work agreement for his/her files once  \nthe proper signatures are secured.  \nFor employees hired before January 1, 2001, the Pharmacist may elect to revoke  \nthe agreement one time. In the event the Pharmacist desires to revoke this  \nagreement or no longer work this shift, the Pharmacist will notify the manager in  \nwriting. The Pharmacist will be given the first available open position which the  \npharmacist is qualified for and has seniority. Management may delay the transfer  \nof the Pharmacist to an open position for up to ninety (90) days once an open  \nposition is available to allow time to fill the 7/70 position. If no position opens in  \none year and the Pharmacist has been in the 7/70 agreement for a minimum of five  \n(5) years, the Pharmacist will go to an 8/80 position one year after written notice  \nhas been given. The Labor Management Committee (or a designated sub-  \ncommittee) will address this situation per Article 5 (Labor Management  \nCommittee) of the Agreement, regarding developing desirable positions as part of  \na master schedule based on seniority.  \nPer Diem: Pharmacists regularly scheduled less than 32 hours per pay period will be  \npaid at the Per Diem rate indicated in Article 3 (Wages).  \nA.  \nPer Diem employees are not eligible for benefits or weekend bonuses. These  \nemployees are eligible for shift differentials, weekend premiums, holiday  \npremium and overtime. Overtime will be defined using the 8 and 80 rule.  \nPer Diem employees are required to work a minimum of two shifts per calendar  \nmonth. If the minimum shift requirement is not met, then the per diem pharmacist  \nwill meet with management for further assessment prior to working additional  \nshifts.  \n"], ["ARTICLE 5: LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE  \n", "A Labor Management Committee (\u201cLMC\u201d) shall be established consisting of equal  \nrepresentatives of labor and management to discuss matters affecting the parties other  \nthan formal grievances that may arise from time to time.  \nThe LMC may establish a sub-committee to review and discuss various scheduling  \nissues.  \nThe LMC will meet monthly, unless cancelled by mutual consent; provided, however, the  \nLMC will meet at least one time per calendar quarter.  \n11  \n"], ["ARTICLE 6: SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL, WEEKEND BONUS, AND LEAD PAY  \n", "6.1 Shift Differential: A shift differential of two dollars and forty cents ($2.40) per hour  \nShall be paid for evening shifts.
