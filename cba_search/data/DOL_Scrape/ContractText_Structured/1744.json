Where, however, there aie no estab-  \nlished decisions or agreements of record, as described  \nabove, relative to jurisdictional work disputes and a juris-  \ndictional work dispute arises wherein this Union is involved  \nwith any other craft and any Employer or such Employer\u2019s  \nSubcontractor, the Employer or Subcontractor involved  \nshail assign the work in accordance with the last known  \ndecision rendered by the National Joint Board of Awards  \nwithin the territorial] jurisdiction covered by this  \nAgreement. Where there are no decisions by the National  \nJoint Board covering similar or same types of disputes in  \nthis jurisdiction, the Employer wilf make the assignment of  \nwork in accordance with area past practice and custom.  \nThe Union agrees that if it enters into an Agreement  \nwith any other Contractors engaged in this type of work  \nwithin the area designated herein upon more favorable  \nterms to such other Contractors than embodied in this  \nAgreement, then such more favorable terms shall immedi-  \nately be added to and become a part hereof upon the  \nEmployer giving the Union five (5) days notice in writing of  \nthe facts involved.  \nThe Union recognizes the Labor Relations Division,  \nHudson Valiey Region, New York State Chapter, Inc.,  \nAssociated Genera!

The Union shall establish and maintain an open employ-  \nment list for the employment of workmen. Such list shal)  \nbe established and maintained on a non-discriminatory  \nbasis, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or  \nnational origin, and shall not be based on, or in any way  \naffected by union membership, by-laws, rules, regula-  \ntions, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect or  \nobligation of union membership, policies or require-  \nments.  \n2. Whenever desiring to employ workmen, the Employer  \nshall call upon the Union for any workmen as the  \nEmployer may, from time to time need, and the Union  \nShall refer such workmen from the open employment list.  \nThe Employer shall give the Union twenty-four (24)  \nhours notice when requiring the services of a workman  \n\u2014  \n   \n| (continued)  \n=  \n4.  \ncovered hereunder, said notice time to be exclusive of  \nSaturday, Sunday and Holidays.  \na) In notifying the Union of its need for the  \nEmployer shall specify to the Union: (1) the number  \nof workers required, (2) the location of the project,  \n(3) the nature and type of involved, (4)  \nthe work to be performed, and (5) such other infor-  \nmation as may be necessary to enable the Union to  \nmake proper referral of applicants.  \nb) When an Employer states requirements for special  \nskills or abilities in his request for Employees, the  \nUnion shall refer the first applicant on the register  \npossessing such skills and abilities.  \nThe Employer shall retain the absolute and uncondition-  \nat right to reject any workman referred by the Union not  \npossessing the requisite work qualifications, or special  \nskills and abilities, since the Union is not to be deemed to  \nguarantee same. However, in no case shall a referred  \nworkman be rejected without just cause. Any workman  \nwho is rejected by the Employer with just cause, shalt be  \nrestored to his place on the list.  \nAli members and registrants on hiring hall lists must per-  \nsonally register and be properly identified and pho-  \ntographed.  \n. Recognizing that many older workers are restricted in  \nthe operation of heavy construction equipment by reason  \nof technical advances and/or physical handicaps which do  \nnot, however, prevent them performing usefully and well,  \ncertain functions of the Operating Engineers\u2019 craft, and  \nwith a view towards maintaining a source of employment  \nfor persons falling in this category, the hiring halt will  \nmaintain a \u201cLimited Preferred Status List,\u201d from which  \ndispatch will be made for maintenance and operation of  \nwelding machines, compressors, elevators, house cars,  \npeneratats, pumps, temporary heating equipment, con-  \nveyors and tuggers.  \nIn order to qualify for referral from this list, the follow-  \ning criteria must be met:  \n(a) The member or registrant must voluntarily submit  \nhis name for inclusion on the list for a minimum peri-  \nod of six (6) months and during this time will not be  \neligible for referrals except as to equipment under  \nthe \u201cLimited Preferred Status List.\u201d  \n(b) The member or registrant on the \u201cLimited Preferred  \nStatus List\u201d must be at least fifty-five (55) years of  \nage and have had twenty years of experience in the  \nindustry as evidenced by his continuing  \non the Hiring Hall List, or in lieu thereof.  \n(c)A person on the \u201cLimited Preferred Status List\"  \nmust have a bonafide physical handicap with proof  \nthereof being submitted to the satisfaction of the  \nExecutive Board of Loca) Union 825, which handicap  \nwould unduly restrict his capacity to operate equip-  \nment other than that on the \u201cLimited Preferred  \nStatus List.\u201d  \n(d) In view of the restriction on employment of those on  \nthe \u201cLimited Preferred Status List\u201d to the equipment  \nspecified herein, contractors may not request an  \n6.  \n7.  \n8.  \n9.  \nEmployee by name on this list.  \n(e) In the event that the \u201cLimited Preferred Status List\u201d  \nis exhausted and no one is available therefrom for  \nemployment, a registrant or member from the gener-  \nal hiring halt list may be referred to a job normally  \nfilled by a person from the \u201cLimited Preferred Status  \nList.\u201d  \nWhen a man is referred from the hiring hall for employ-  \nment, he shall continue to retain his position at the top of  \nthe hiring hall list, until he has completed one hundred  \nand twenty (120) hours of employment, after which time  \nhis name shall be re-registered in proper position as of  \nthe date of notification to the hiring hail of his availabil-  \nity,  \nIn order that the hiring hall list may correctly reflect the  \navailability of registrants, each member and registrant  \nmust present himself in person at Jeast once a year to the  \nhiring hall dispatcher for review of his registration card.  \nRegistration cards will contain information as to the  \nequipment that the registrant can operate and his experi-  \nence in such operation. If a registrant has been dis-  \ncharged by two or more Contractors because of alleged  \ninability to operate the equipment, the equipment in  \nquestion will be removed from his hiring hall card, and he  \nwill not be dispatched on that equipment. If the regis-  \ntrant wishes to appeal the removal of the equipment  \nfrom his card, he may request an opportunity to demon-  \nstrate his ability to the Local Union Examining commit-  \ntee, at the Training Site.  \nThe dispatcher in making referrals from the hiring hall,  \nbased in part on an Employer\u2019s request to reemploy a  \nman who is available and who has had \u201crecent employ-  \nment,\" shall not consider employment as \u201crecent,\u201d  \nunless it was within the preceding one hundred and  \ntwenty (120) days from the date of request, exclusive of  \nwinter  \n10. Unless otherwise provided by the Collective Bargaining  \n1  \ndet  \nAgreement with the Local Union, no person dispatched  \nfrom the hiring hall will operate any machine or equip-  \nment other than those to which he was originally  \nassigned to on referral, without approval of the hiring  \nhall,  \n_ When the machine or equipment to which a man was  \nreferred is moved to a different job or shut down, the  \noperator must notify the hiring hall.  \n12. No person selected for referral from the hiring hall will  \n13.  \nbe allowed to refuse a job without just cause. Two such  \nrefusals without just cause will result in his displacement  \nto the bottom of the hiring hall list.  \nIt shalt be the privilege of members and registrants to  \nplace their names on any one, or all, of the hiring hail  \nlists maintained at the various Union offices throughout  \nthe jurisdiction of Locat 825.  \n14. Upon request of a member or registrant, the hiring hall  \ndispatcher shall inform him of his present position on  \nthe hiring hall referral list. If the member or registrant  \nbelieves that his placement on the list is improper and  \ndiscriminates against him with reference to a possibte  \nARTICLE f (continued)  \n15.  \njob referral, he shall have the right to review his position  \non the list. If the member or registrant continues to  \nbelieve his placement on the list was improper or dis-  \ncriminatory he may file a claim pursuant to Section 15,  \nof these rules.  \nAny member or registrant on the employment list who  \nmakes written claim that he has been discriminated  \nagainst in violation of his rights under the Labor  \nManagement Relations Act of 1947, as amended, by  \nexclusion from a job refersal, shall have the 1ight to an  \nimmediate appeal to a Joint Board consisting of two (2)  \nmembers of the Union and two (2) repiesentatives of  \nthe Employer, who shal] be respectively designated  \nupon the signing of the Collective Bargaining  \nAgreement. Voting by members of the Joint Board  \nShall be on a unit basis. In case the Joint Board fails to  \nreach a unanimous decision, the claim shal] be submit-  \nted expeditiously to an impartial umpire, to be agreed  \nupon by the Joint Board, herein created, whose decision  \nshall be binding and conclusive.  \nThe Claim of any member or registrant who feels that  \nhe has been discriminated against must be filed in writ-  \ning with the Union ten (10) days from the date of the  \nalleged discriminatory practice, in order to entitle him  \n16.  \nto the benefits of the appeal procedure hereinbefore set  \nforth.  \nThe cost and expense of establishing and maintaining  \nthe open list and of referrals therefrom, shall be borne  \nby all of the registrants thereon. In the case of regis-  \ntrants, who are not members of the Union, their share  \nof such costs and expenses shall not exceed a sum equal  \nto the pro-rata share of the cost and expenses of oper-  \nating the employment list and the referrals therefrom,  \nwhich is being borne by members of the Union from the  \npayment of union dues. After seven (7) days from the  \ndate of this Agreement or of the date of registry on the  \nlist, whichever is later, registrants shall incur the obliga-  \ntion of making quarterly payments of their share of such  \ncost and expenses. Failure of a registrant to make pay-  \nment of such cost and expenses shall constitute grounds  \nfor removal from such list and shall nullify any prior  \nreferral therefrom.  \n17. A registrant must have maintained his permanent resi-  \ndence in the geographical area of the entire State of  \nNew Jersey and the five Southern Counties of New  \nYork (Delaware, Ulster, Orange, Sullivan and  \nRockland) for a period of one (1) year, or, who having  \nhad a permanent home in the area, has temporarily Jeft  \nwith the intention of returning to this area as his per-  \nmanent home,  \nAll references in the foregoing Hiring Hall Rules, to the  \nmasculine gender, shall be deemed to include the femi-  \nnine gender.  \n"], ["ARTICLE Il  \nCONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF  \nREGISTERED INDENTURED APPRENTICES  \n", "1.A Registered Indentured Heavy Equipment Operator  \nApprentice may be employed on any job that has a mini-  \nmum of 10 pieces of grading, paving or excavating equip-  \nment or five (5) Operating Engineers on the job operat-  \ning the same types of equipment and having additional  \npieces of similar type available for the Apprentices to be  \nassigned to.  \nA Registered Indentured Heavy Duty Mechanic  \nApprentice may be employed on any job that has a  \nJourneyman Mechanic.  \nA Registered Indentured Field Engineer  \nApprentice may be employed on any job that has a  \nSurvey Crew.
