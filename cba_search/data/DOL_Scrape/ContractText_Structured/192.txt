{A} The purpose of the Company and the Union in entering  
into this Labor Agreement is to set forth their agraement  
on rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of  
employmen] so as to promote orderly and peacetul  
relations with the employees, to achieve uninterrupted  
operations in the plant, and to achieve the highas! level  
of employee perlormance consistent with salety, good  
health, and sustained effort.  
(8) Tha Campany and the Union encourage the highest  
possible degree of friendly, cooperative relationships  
between their respective representatives ai all levels and  
with and between all employees. The officers of the  
Company and the Union realize that this goal depends on  
more Ihan words in a labor agreement, that it depends  
primazily on attitudes between people in their respective  
organizations and al all levels of responsibility, They  
believe that proper attitudes must be based on full  
understanding of and regard for the respective rights and  
responsibilities of both the Company and the Union.  
They believe also that proper attitudes are of major  
importance in the plant where day-to-day operations and  
administration of this Agreement demand fairness and  
understanding. They beliave that these attitudes can be  
encouraged best when it is made clear that Company and  
Union offidals, whose dulies involved negotiation of this  
Agreement, are not anti-Union or antiCompany bul are  
sincerely concerned with the best interests and well-being  
of ihe business and atl employees.
