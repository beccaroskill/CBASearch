If a leave is requested for an employee\u2019s own serious health  \ncondition, the employee must first use all of his or her accrued vacation leave, sick leave,  \npersonal leave, or short term disability leave. If leave is requested for any other reason listed  \n-40-  \n\u201886/6/30 2:44PM  \nbelow, an employee must first use all of his or her accrued paid vacation or personal leave. The  \nremainder of the leave period will then consist of unpaid leave.  \n(b) Leave Period. An eligible employee is entitled to take up to a maximum of 12  \nweeks of family or medical leave in any 12-month period.

However, if the leave is taken by  \neither spouse to care for the other who is seriously ill and unable to work, to care for a child with  \na serious health condition, or for his or her own serious illness, then each employee is eligible for  \n12 weeks of leave.  \n(d) Application for Leave. An employee requesting family or medical leave must  \ncomplete the \u201cApplication for Family or Medical Leave\u201d form (the employee can obtain the form  \n-4|-  \n16/6/30 2:54PM  \nfrom the administrative assistant in the employee\u2019s local administration office) and immediately  \nreturn it to the administrative assistant from whom the employee obtained the form. The  \ncompleted application must state the reason for the leave, the duration of the leave, and the  \nstarting and ending dates of the leave.  \n(e) Notice of Leave, Ail employees of the Company who request FMLA leave when  \nthe need is \u201cforeseeable\u201d are required to give 30 days notice prior to the commencement of \u00a9  \nleave.

In the case of serious  \nhealth conditions, leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when  \nmedically necessary. Employees are expected to make a reasonable effort to schedule  \nintermittent leave so as not to disrupt the operations of the Company. The Company may require  \nan eligible employee on intermittent or reduced leave to transfer temporarily to an available  \nalternative position for which the eligible employee is qualified if the position has equivalent pay  \nand benefits and better accommodates the recurring periods of leave than the eligible employee\u2019s  \nregular position.  \n(g) Medical Certification of Leave. The application for leaye based on the \u201cserious  \nhealth condition\u201d of the employee or the employee\u2019s spouse, child, or parent must be  \naccompanied by a \u201cHealth Care Certification\u201d completed by the health care provider (the  \nemployee can obtain the form from the administrative assistant in the employee\u2019s local  \nadministration office), The certification must state the date on which the serious health condition  \n\u201816/6/30 2:54 PM  \ncommenced, probable duration of the condition, and the appropriate medical facts regarding the  \ncondition.

If the employee has a serious health condition, the medical  \ncertification must state that the employee cannot perform the functions of his or her job.

Reimbursement will not be required if the employee does not return to  \n43-  \n16/6/30 2:54PM  \nwork because of a serious health condition or other circumstances beyond the employee\u2019s  \ncontrol.  \n(j) Restoration to Employment.
