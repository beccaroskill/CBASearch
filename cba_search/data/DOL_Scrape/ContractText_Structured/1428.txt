membership in the Union, as a condition of continued employment of all employees covered by  
this Agreement, within eight (8) days following the effective date of this Agreement, or within

however, that such membership in the Union 1s available to such employees on the same terms  
and conditions generally applicable to other members and that such membership is not denied or  
terminated for reason other than a failure by the affected employee to tender the periodic dues  
and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.

cards of its employees requesting the Contractor to make deductions from wages for the amount

the various Fund contributions made by the Employer pursuant to this Agreement. Upon the  
Employer request, the Union shall furnish the Employer with a copy of the employees written  
authorization. Failure of the Union to submit such authorization shall relieve the Employer of  
the obligation to deduct the Working Dues Deduction. Such written authorization by an  
employee may be revoked by the employee during a ten (10) day period prior to the anniversary  
or termination date of this Agreement, whichever occurs first. In the absence of such revocation,  
sent and received in accordance with the foregoing, the authorization shall be renewed for  
additional yearly periods during the term of this Agreement. The employee’s written  
authorization shall require that the employee acknowledge that employment in the construction  
industry may cause the employee to be employed by several different Employers signatory to  
this Collective Bargaining Agreement and that the authorization will extend to all Employers for  
whom the employee may perform work under the terms and provisions of the Collective  
Bargaining Agreement in force and effect as of the time of employment. It shall be the Union’s  
obligation to provide each Employer with a copy of each employee’s current written  
authorization upon the establishment or re-establishment of an employment relationship.

assignment to merit consideration of pay for members of the claiming craft, the claim of improper assignment

Employer will continue with his original assignment until the two (2) Business Agents of the claiming Unions

International Representative, he makes the assignment in accordance with their decision. Back wages, if  
assessed for non-compliance with the final decision of the Business Agents and/or International Representatives
