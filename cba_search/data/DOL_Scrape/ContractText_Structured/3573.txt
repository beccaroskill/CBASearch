Organization agree that trifling matters should not result in unnecessary bargaining efforts.  
Matters that significantly affect more than one Wing will be conducted at the HRO level.

Employer or the Labor Organization may constitute grounds for Unfair Labor Practice charges.  
When the Employer or Labor Organization has been accused of committing an Unfair Labor  
Practice, the charging party should make every reasonable effort to inform the offending party  
the nature of the charge prior to formal submission to FLRA, and to resolve such charges  
informally. At such time as the charging party feels no legitimate effort or progress is being  
made toward resolution, the charging party may make a formal submission to FLRA.  
Section 5: The Labor Organization agrees to cooperate with the Employer in truly voluntary  
charity drives and to lend its support to these worthy causes. In conducting these drives, the  
parties will be guided by appropriate regulations which provide that no compulsion or reprisals

training of technicians.  
Section 2; When changes in functions, organization, mission, or equipment affect the work  
force to the extent that employees are put in different positions for which they are not fully  
qualified, but for which they meet minimum qualifications, these employees will be afforded the  
opportunity to be retrained. In exercising Management’s Rights, the Employer intends to provide  
employees cross-training to the extent that such training is in the best interest of both the  
Employer and the technician and the duties of the employees concerned are compatible to  
retraining. Some qualifications may be waived in accordance with the provisions of Qualification  
Standards for General Schedule Positions.  
Section 3: An employee may attend a training course in a technician status as prescribed in  
current and future laws, regulations, and budgetary guidance. Incidental duties at military

the Employer will furnish the procedures for applying for training when such training is job  
connected and is to be paid by the Employer.  
Section 4: Supervisors will identify those situations in the specific work environment where  
additional training can aid in achieving the mission of the Employer. Available training programs  
will be discussed with the employees who are eligible for such training.

permitted to post appropriate notices and information on the computer bulletin board. The Labor  
Organization will be allowed to use government messenger envelopes and the internal  
distribution system to distribute official correspondence to Labor Organization Officials,  
Stewards, and the Employer. The Labor Organization agrees that it is responsible for the neat  
and orderly maintenance of this space, including removal of obsolete material. The following  
statement may be posted by the Labor Organization on appropriate bulletin boards:

Section 1 ; Policy: The Labor Organization or Management shall not in any way discriminate  
against an individual regarding employment or conditions of employment because of race, color,  
religion, sex, national origin, age, or mental or physical handicap.  
Section 2: The Employer and the Labor Organization agree to cooperate in providing equal  
opportunity in employment for all persons, to prohibit discrimination because of age, race, color,  
religion, sex, physical/mental handicap, national origin, or retaliation as a result of a previous EEO  
Issue and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a continuing  
affirmative program.  
Section 3: The Employer will utilize to the fullest extent, the present skills of employees and will  
provide the maximum feasible opportunity to employees to enhance their skills through on-the-  
job training, work-study programs, and other training measures so that they may perform at their  
highest potential and advance in accordance with their abilities.  
Section 4: The Employer agrees to provide career opportunities to employees who are under-  
represented in higher grades as outlined in the Employee Equal Opportunity Commission  
management directed 715 reports.  
Section 5: Program Recommendations: Review of programs and recommendations for  
improvements in the EEO program are appropriate topics for discussion between the Labor  
Organization and the Employer.  
Section 6: Disciplinary Actions: When supervisors or managers become aware of potential  
discrimination or sexual harassment situations they have the right to conduct a preliminary  
investigation into the matter to determine if disciplinary or adverse action is necessary. The  
supervisor’s right to conduct preliminary investigation does not halt or prevent an EEO Counselor  
from conducting an inquiry into the same matter. When discrimination is found or it appears that  
discrimination may have occurred, the Director of Staff, Air will take appropriate action.  

### ARTICLE 12  
### SEXUAL HARASSMENT  
### 
Section 1: Sexual harassment is a particular type of sex discrimination which undermines the  
integrity of the employment relationship. All employees must be allowed to work in an  
environment free from unsolicited and unwelcome sexual overtures.  
Section 2: Sexual harassment is defined as: a form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcomed  
sexual advances, requests of sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature  
when:  
a. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term  
or condition of a person’s job, pay, or career, or  
b. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or  
employment decisions affecting that person, or  
c. Such conduct interferes with an individual’s performance or creates an intimidating,  
hostile, or offensive environment.  
Section 3: Employees who are sexually harassed by supervisors, superiors, coworkers, peers, or  
by individuals external to our organization who have contact with employees in our work  
environment should make it clear that such behavior is offensive and report the harassment to the  
appropriate level. It is the responsibility of the supervisor/manager to examine the matter and take  
necessary action.  
Section 4; An employee may file a complaint of sexual harassment or of discrimination utilizing  
proper EEO procedures.  

### ARTICLE 13  
### DISCIPLINE AND ADVERSE ACTIONS  
### 
Section 1: There are a variety of options available to resolve issues/situations involving  
technicians. TPRs 715, 752, and 752-1 provide a range of personnel actions available to address  
these situations. The procedures in these TPRs will be followed by the parties.  
A logical progressive sequence for correcting inappropriate action/ behavior would include:  
counseling; warning; oral admonishment; Letter of Reprimand (LOR); suspension; etc. It is  
recognized that circumstances may exist where progressive discipline may not be appropriate.  
Section 2. Labor Organization Representation: Technicians in the bargaining unit have a right to  
Labor Organization representation at a meeting which involves an examination of the employee  
by a representative of the Employer in connection with an investigation. This right to  
representation does not extend to performance counseling. It is the employee’s responsibility to  
request representation if he/she reasonably believes that an examination may result in  
disciplinary action. Once the employee requests representation, the employer can grant the  
request, discontinue the interview, or offer the employee the choice of continuing the interview  
without a Labor Organization representative. The employer cannot continue the interview  
without a Labor Organization representative unless the employee voluntarily agrees to remain  
unrepresented after having been made aware of these choices. The parties agree that an employee  
engaged in an investigatory interview has the right to remain silent, and may refuse to give a  
written statement until a representative is present, or representation has been declined in  
accordance with this Section.  
Section 3: Appeals: Appeals will be filed in accordance with TPR 752 and TPR 752-1.  
Section 4. Letters of Reprimand (LOR’s) and all adverse actions must be cleared by the HRO-  
LRS prior to being issued to the employee. Adverse actions not cleared by HRO-LRS shall not  
be considered official.  
Section 5: A letter of reprimand will be for a period of up to twelve (12) months, and that it may  
be removed prior to the specified time if conduct improves. Further related infractions may reset  
the 12 month window.  
Section 6. During a proposed adverse action the employee will remain in a duty status pending  
the Original Decision. The Agency may determine that an employee awaiting discipline should  
not be present at the worksite because it may adversely impact the mission, cause a safety  
concer, or unduly disrupt the work area. In that case the Agency may place the employee in a  
non-duty pay status for all or part of the time it takes to process the Original Decision.  
Section 7. Employees will be given a minimum of ten (10) calendar days following receipt of a  
Notice of Proposed Adverse Action (NoPAA) to furnish a reply to the Deciding Official. The  
timeline does not begin until the employee or their representative has been provided copies of all  
documentation referenced as relied upon in the NoPAA to justify the discipline.  
Section 8. When a Deciding Official imposes a suspension, change to lower grade, or removal,  
the deciding official will inform the employee of their right to appeal IAW NGB TPR 752-1, or  
to file a grievance LAW Article 14. In cases of removal, deciding official will adhere to the  
timelines in TPR 752-1.  
Section 9. Where the original decision letter imposes a suspension, change to lower grade or  
removal, imposition of the action may be held in abeyance at the request of the Technician and  
concurrence of The Adjutant General.  
a. The request will be made to The Adjutant General, with written justification, through  
the HRO within fifteen (15) calendar days after issuance of the original decision.  
b. The Adjutant General or designated representative will consider the request and will  
meet within ten (10) calendar days and provide an opportunity to meet and confer with the  
Technician and their representative on the merits of the request.  
c. The Adjutant General or designated representative will render a written decision within  
five (5) days after the information is received and the meeting has occurred to inform the  
Technician as to whether or not the request will be granted.

the right to request Labor Organization representation in the grievance procedure or to decline  
such representation. However, the Labor Organization will be given the opportunity to have a  
representative present during all grievance proceedings to ensure that the adjustments of the  
grievance are not inconsistent with the terms of the contract. A grievance will be formally  
presented not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the grievance took place, or the individual  
becomes aware of the events that constitute the grievance, or when the individual is made aware  
that the incident is grievable, whichever is later. The Employer will be given five (5) days to  
respond informally if required.

grievance concerning:  
a. Any grievance concerning a matter stated in 5 U.S.C. § 7121(c)  
b. EEO Complaints shall be addressed IAW 5 U.S.C. 7121(d).  
Section 4: Employee Rights:  
a. All employees have the right to present their grievances to the appropriate management  
officials for prompt consideration. This procedure provides a means for the prompt and orderly  
consideration and resolution of employee or Labor Organization grievances. In exercising this  
right, the employees and the Labor Organization will be free from restraint, coercion,  
discrimination, or reprisal.  
b. Most grievances arise from misunderstandings or disputes which can be resolved promptly  
and satisfactorily on an informal basis at the immediate supervisory level. An informal grievance  
must be presented within the thirty (30) calendar day period prior to filing a formal grievance  
described in Section | above. It will be accomplished in time to allow the supervisor five (5)  
calendar days to reply. While dissatisfactions and disagreements arise occasionally among  
people in any work situation, the filing of a grievance shall not be construed as reflecting  
unfavorably on an employee(s) good standing, their performance, or their loyalty or desirability  
to the organization.  
28  
Section 5: Employee and Agency Grievance Procedures  
a. A grievance must be presented using the negotiated grievance form located in Annex A of  
this agreement  
b. The Labor Organization has the right, on its own behalf or on the behalf of the bargaining  
unit employees, to present and process grievances.  
c. Ifan employee or group of employees elects to present their grievance without the  
assistance of the Labor Organization, adjustments of the grievance must be consistent with the  
provisions of this agreement. A Labor Organization representative will be allowed to be present  
during grievance proceedings.  
d. The appropriate supervisor/management official involved will notify the Labor  
Organization of grievance proceedings and inform them of the time and place of such  
proceedings.  
Section 6: Informal Grievance: Prior to filing a Formal Grievance, the employee/Labor  
Organization Representative will meet with the immediate supervisor to try and resolve any  
misunderstandings or disputes at that level. If the misunderstanding or dispute cannot be  
resolved, the employee/Labor Organization Representative and supervisor will date and initial  
the grievance form.  
Section 7: Formal Grievance: If a settlement cannot be agreed to at the informal level, the  
following procedure will be used:  
Step I: Within five (5) workdays after receipt of the written decision on the informal  
grievance, the formal grievance shall be presented by the aggrieved or his/her representative to  
the Group Commander. The Grievance shall be submitted on the grievance form {Appendix A)  
through his/her designated representative and the written decision on the informal grievance if  
received, shall be attached. Upon receipt of the formal grievance, the Group Commander, shall,  
within ten (10) workdays, render a written decision. Failure of the Group Commander to answer  
within the above time limit shall allow the Labor Organization to proceed to Step 2.  
Step 2: Within five (5) workdays after receipt of the written decision on the informal  
grievance, the formal grievance shall be presented by the aggrieved or his/her representative to  
the Wing Commander. Upon receipt of the formal grievance, the Wing Commander, shall,

within the above time limit shall allow the Labor Organization to proceed to Step 3.  
Step 3. Upon receipt of the formal grievance, The Adjutant General or designated  
representative, shall, within ten (10) workdays, render a written decision. Failure of The  
Adjutant General or designated representative to answer within the above time limit shall allow  
the Labor Organization to proceed to arbitration of the grievance without further delay. The  
grievant may request a meeting with The Adjutant General or his designated representative to  
discuss the matters of said grievance. The acceptance of this meeting will be at the discretion of  
29  
The Adjutant General. The Adjutant General's decision will be provided in writing, to the  
agerieved party, the Labor Organization, and the grievant’s representative (if one has been  
designated).

grieve. A grievance should be formally submitted, in writing, as soon as possible, but not more  
than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the aggrieved incident or knowledge of the  
incident. The Employer may initiate a formal grievance by submitting the matter, in writing, to  
the President of the Local Chapter, Association of Civilian Technicians (ACT), or designated  
representative. The Labor Organization President will attempt to adjust the grievance and will  
render a decision, in writing, to the Employer within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the  
grievance. If the grievance is not settled by this method, the Employer may refer the matter to  
arbitration. Nothing herein wili preclude the parties from attempting to settle such grievances  
informally.  
Section 9: All time limits in this article may be extended by mutual consent. Failure of the  
Employer to observe the time limits shall entitle the Labor Organization to advance the grievance  
to the next step. Failure of the grievant to observe time limits will terminate the grievance

management will supply the Labor Organization with any investigation reports and/or documents  
used in the original action when denying a grievance unless prohibited by law, rule or regulation.

### ARBITRATION  
### 
Section 1: If the Employer and the Labor Organization fail to resolve any grievance processed  
under the negotiated grievance procedure, such grievance, upon written request by either party  
within thirty (30) calendar days after issuance of a final decision, may be submitted to arbitration.  
The cost for requesting a list of arbitrators will be borne by the requesting party.  
Section 2: Selecting The Arbitrator: Within five (5) days from the date of receipt of a valid  
arbitration notice, the parties shall attempt to select an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree  
upon an arbitrator, they shall immediately request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation  
Service (FMCS) to submit a list of seven (7) impartial persons qualified to act as arbitrators. A  
brief statement of the nature of the issues in dispute will accompany the request to enable the  
Service to submit the names of arbitrators qualified for the issues involved. The request shall also  
include a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. In the event that the entire agreement is  
not available, a verbatim copy of any provision relating to arbitration of the grievance shall  
accompany the request. The parties shall meet within eight (8) workdays after the receipt of such  
list to select an arbitrator. If they cannot agree upon one (1) of the listed persons, the Employer  
and the Labor Organization will each strike one (1) arbitrator's name from the list of seven (7)  
and shall repeat this procedure until only one (1) name remains. The remaining name shall be the  
only and duly selected arbitrator. The Labor Organization will strike first. The grievant may  
withdraw the grievance at any time prior to the actual convening of a hearing or submission of  
the case to the arbitrator. Fees associated with the request for a list of arbitrators will be paid  
50% by both parties.  
Section 4: Prior to the appointment of an arbitrator, the parties shall attempt to determine all  
significant aspects of the arbitrator‘s basis for charges and fees and expenses including the hearing,  
travel, study, and writing time. The prevailing party shall pay twenty-five (25) percent of the

Section 6: The arbitrator’s decision shal! be submitted to the Employer and the Labor Organization  
in writing. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding except that either party may file an  
exception to the Federal Labor Relations Authority subject to their regulations. The provisions of  
Section 709(f) (4) of Title 32, U.S.C. are excluded from binding arbitration.  
Section 7: Either party by pre-hearing motion may seek resolution by the arbitrator of any  
procedural matter, such as pre-hearing production of documents, identities of witnesses, and their  
expected testimony; deadlines for pre-hearing motions, responses, and replies; and scheduling of  
motion oral arguments, pre-hearing conferences, and an evidentiary hearing, if required. If the  
31  
matter is not resolved through pre-hearing motions, the grieving party will have the option of any  
one of the following arbitration procedures:  
a. A stipulation of facts to the arbitrator may be used when both parties agree to the facts  
at issue and a hearing would serve no purpose. In this case, all facts, data,  
documentation, etc., are jointly submitted to the arbitrator with a request for a decision  
based upon the facts presented.  
b. An arbitrator inquiry may be used when a formal hearing would serve no purpose. In  
this case, the arbitrator would make such inquiries as he/she deemed necessary (e.g.,  
inspecting work sites, taking statements).  
c. A submission to arbitration hearing may be used when a formal hearing is necessary to  
develop and establish the facts relevant to the issue. In this case, a formal hearing is  
convened and conducted by the arbitrator.  
d. A mini-arbitration may be used to expedite the resolution of the grievance. In this  
case, the arbitrator would make such inquirtes as he/she deemed necessary, prepare a  
brief summary of the facts and render an on-the-spot decision.

change in work schedule by the seven (7) day posted schedule the supervisor will make every  
attempt to give the employee seven (7) day advance notification either verbally or in writing. In  
any case, documentation is required in cases where notification is less than seven (7) days due to  
reasons beyond the supervisor's control. For those sections that require posted work schedules,  
changes in their posted work schedule will be initialed and dated by the supervisor at the time of  
the change.  
c. Changes in work schedules and work hours may be made on an individual basis when  
necessary to perform the assigned mission of the Employer and will be distributed equally  
among eligible and qualified employees to the extent possible. A change in work hours will not  
be used as a disciplinary action. The Comptroller will maintain a record of employees who work  
other than the basic workweek and basic work hours. This record can be reviewed by the Labor  
Organization Representative upon request.  
d. Employees may trade shifts on a permanent or temporary basis if both agree, they are  
both qualified to perform the duties, and a request is submitted to and approved by the  
supervisor.  
e. A lunch period, (no less than thirty minutes (30) minutes for 188 WG and no less than  
forty-five (45) minutes for 189 AW), free of duty, is authorized beginning not earlier than four  
hours into the shift and not later than five and one half hours into the shift. Employer understands  
that delays returning from a lunch location/vendor may happen due to security protocol/actions.  
Breaks in work hours of no less than thirty minutes (30) minutes (for 188 WG) and no less than  
forty-five (45) minutes (for 189 AW) shali not be scheduled in any basic workday. When the  
period of overtime requires a meal break, normally a 30-minute non-paid meal break will be  
34  
provided to begin no later than two (2) hours after overtime begins. Supervisors will schedule  
their personnel to ensure the work areas are covered during lunch periods.  
f. If an employee is not given an opportunity to take a lunch period as described above, and  
an employee cannot leave their work area due to mission need, the employee will receive a  
twenty (20) minute on the clock lunch. The employee must remain in the work area and be  
prepared to perform required duties. This will allow the duty day to end thirty minutes (30)  
minutes (for 188 WG) and forty-five (45) minutes for (189 AW) prior to the scheduled end of the  
duty day or for the employee to earn compensatory time if approved by appropriate management  
official. The employee may reschedule their lunch to a later time in lieu of this procedure if  
approved by the supervisor.  
Section 2: No more than five (5) minutes will be allowed for personal hygiene time prior to the  
end of the workday, if the work processes so require. An additional five (5) minutes will be  
granted for those who require a shower provided a shower is available. Nothing in this section is  
intended to imply that employees have been relieved of their duty obligations prior to the end of  
their scheduled tour of duty.  
Section 3: Employees will be given one fifteen (15) minute break period for each four (4) hour  
period of continuous work. The break period will normally be at the mid-point of the four (4)  
hour work period. If an employee is not given an opportunity to take a break period as described,  
and an employee cannot leave their work area due to mission need, the employee will receive a  
fifteen (15) minute break when work is finished. The employee must remain in the work area and  
be prepared to perform required duties

### ARTICLE 18  
### COMPENSATORY TIME  
### 
Section 1; Supervisors will not assign compensatory time work as a reward or penalty; and will  
give consideration to all circumstances, including employees' personal problems, when assigning  
compensatory time work. A record of compensatory time performed will be maintained in the  
approved system of timekeeping and may be reviewed by the employee upon request.  
Section 2: The Employer agrees to provide the employee with as much advance notice, through  
supervisory chain, as possible when the assignment of compensatory time work as an extension of  
the normal workday is required. The Employer will make every attempt to provide the employee  
with at least two (2) hours advance notification. When the requirement to work compensatory time  
no longer exists for an employee that has been notified, the Employer will provide the employee  
with a minimum of two (2) hours work, if desired by the employee, provided such work is  
available. Employees selected to work compensatory time on days outside their basic workweek  
will be notified by their supervisor as soon as possible, but no less than twenty (20) clock work  
hours prior to duty day unless a shorter notification period is absolutely necessary due to  
unforeseen requirements.  
Section 3: Employees who perform compensatory time work as an extension of the normal  
workday will be allowed a fifteen (15) minute rest period in keeping with that described in Article  
17. Workers, who are required to work compensatory time work without prior notices in  
emergency cases, will be allowed to phone their respective homes without cost to the employee.  
The phone call will not exceed five (5) minutes duration. The employee will log the call in  
accordance with base policy.  
Section 4: Employees in trainee status, or on details, shall be considered for compensatory time  
work in the same manner as other employees, provided employees possess required and necessary  
qualifications to perform the work.  
Section 5: Employees who perform compensatory time work as an extension of the normal  
workday will not be required to take a meal period. However, if the employee elects to take a meal  
break during the period of compensatory time worked, the meal period will be free of duty and  
will not be included as compensatory time worked. When time off for meal break is not possible,  
a period of twenty (20) minutes or less may be counted as time worked for which compensation is  
allowed. Where such an on-the-job lunch period is in effect, employee(s) must spend the time in  
close proximity to their work stations and must be available for work.  
Section 6: Employees called in to work outside and unconnected with their basic workweek, shall  
be furnished with a minimum of two (2) hours work. In addition, any employee called in to work  
under the provisions of this section may be promptly released upon completion of the work that  
he/she was called upon to perform. The parties intend to implement this provision in a manner that  
is consistent with the applicable provisions of 5 C.F.R. § 550.112(h) (in terms of compensatory  
time) and that preserves management's right to assign work under 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a)(2)(B) when  
there is work that needs to be accomplished, this provision is approved.  
36  
Section 7: On-Call Status and Call-Back: On-Call Status [5 CFR 551.431]. An employee may be  
placed tn "On-Call Status" for specified period of time covering non-duty hours. The employee  
must:  
Retain the ability to perform their work.  
Remain within a reasonable commuting area from the duty station (usually must  
be able to depart to the duty station within an hour after call-back).  
Provide a telephone number where they can be reached.  
The employee may be allowed to make an arrangement in advance to have another  
employee report in his stead and notify the Employer of the arrangement. All  
proposed assignment changes must be approved in advance by Employer.  
The employee will receive compensatory time for all hours actually worked when  
on-call, but will not receive compensatory time for being in "on-call" status. On-  
call should be used when need is anticipated, but there is no immediate, specific  
threat.  
Any employee called in for duty on a day when work was not scheduled for them,  
or for which they are required to return to their place of employment, is deemed at  
least two (2) hours of compensatory time in duration. If the duty time exceeds the  
first 2 hours, an employee will be awarded compensatory time for the amount of  
time worked.  
NOTE: Alcohol consumption and use of specific prescription or over the counter drugs are  
consistent with restrictions required to maintain the ability to perform work.  
37  

### ARTICLE 19  
### HOLIDAYS  
### 
Section 1: Eligible employees shall be entitled to all holidays that are established by law, and those  
that may be added by law, and all holidays designated by Executive Order shall be observed as  
regular holidays.  
Section 2: If an employee works on a holiday falling on one of his/her regular work days, or on a  
day designated as his or her "in lieu of holiday”, he/she will be entitled to premium pay.  
Section 3: The Employer will strive to ensure that all employees are free to observe holidays.  
Section 4: The Employer will equally distribute holiday work among eligible and qualified  
employees.  
Section 5: Accurate records of holiday work assignments for employees will be maintained on the  
time and attendance cards, and these cards will be made available to the Labor Organization, upon  
request, in case of a grievance.  
Section 6: When a holiday falls on the employee’s first non-workday, the preceding workday is  
designated as the “in lieu of’ holiday. When the holiday falls on the second non-workday or third  
non-workday, the next workday is designated as the “in lieu of’ holiday in accordance with Section  
6103(b)(2) of Title 5, United States Code and Executive Order 11582.” Example: If an employee’s  
normal day off is Friday and a holiday falls on that Friday the employee will have the previous  
day (Thursday) off in lieu of. If an employee’s normal day off is Monday and a holiday falls on  
that day the employee will have the following day (Tuesday) off in lieu of.

### ARTICLE 20  
### LEAVE  
### 
Section 1: The Employer and the Labor Organization agree to follow the applicable leave  
regulations.  
Section 2: When requested, the employee may project annual leave for a week or more, for the  
calendar year. The Employer will attempt to make leave available to each employee as requested,  
including extended leave forecasts so long as the employee’s absence does not adversely affect  
the ability of the section to perform its mission. The Supervisor will approve or disapprove the  
request for leave as soon as possible but not later than five (5) work days prior to leave start date  
and return duplicate to the employee. Previously approved leave will not be canceled by the  
Employer except for reasons of such magnitude that the employee absence would impair either  
the mission of the Arkansas Air National Guard or its Supported Units. This provision describes  
how management should treat previously approved leave and provides that such leave should be  
cancelled only for valid work related reasons. The parties intent, in implementing this provision,  
to preserve management's right to assign work under 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a)(2)(B) and that  
management solely determines whether there is work to be performed and whether there is a  
mission related or workload need that justifies the cancellation of an employee's previously  
approved leave.  
Section 3: Subject to mission requirements and in accordance with the procedures in the  
Supervisor’s Handbook, leave without pay may be granted an employee to serve as an employee,  
officer, or representative of the Association of Civilian Technicians (ACT) for a period of one  
(1) year. Subject to the needs of the Employer, extensions may be granted upon request.  
Extensions will be requested in writing to the Employer forty-five (45) days prior to the  
expiration date of the original Leave Without Pay (LWOP) grant. When an employee is on  
LWOP, under the provisions of this article, he/she shall be entitled to return to a position of  
comparable grade, status, and pay if such position is available in the Air Technician Manning  
Document supporting the military organization. If a comparable position is not  
available, the offer of the best vacancy available for which the employee is qualified will be  
made.  
Section 4: Every employee shall earn sick leave at the rate which is set by regulation or statutes.  
Sick leave shall be used in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including but not  
limited to 5 C.F.R. sub-sections 630 and the Family Medical Leave Act. It is the responsibility of  
the employee to appropriately identify requests for sick leave under 5 C.F.R. 630.401 at the time  
the request is made. Each employee must notify his/her first or second level supervisor of  
impending absence due to illness as soon as possible, but in no case later than two (2) hours after  
the beginning of the workday. Failure to report, in person or by telephone, within the proper time  
frame will result in the individual being placed in an appropriate leave status for the period of  
absence prior to notification.  
Section 5: Medical Certificates for Sick Leave:  
39  
The Employer may require an employee to provide a medical certificate to  
authorize sick leave for absences in excess of three (3) work days. Unless the  
Employer determines otherwise, an employee upon request will be authorized  
sick leave for absences that are three (3) work days or less without providing a  
medical certificate.  
If the Employer requires a medical certificate to authorize sick leave, of any  
duration, the Employer will inform the employee of the requirement in advance or  
within a reasonable time after the employee notifies the Employer of the sick  
leave request.  
If the Employer determines that an employee’s sick leave record is  
questionable—due to absences for short periods at frequent intervals and reason  
to believe the sick leave privilege is being abused, or another reason—the  
Employer will notify the employee of the determination and may advise the  
employee that a medical certificate will be required to support any future grant of  
sick leave regardless of duration.  
If the Employer requires a medical certificate to authorize sick leave for an  
absence of three (3) work days or less, without in advance having made and  
informed the employee of a determination that the employee’s sick leave record is  
questionable, the Employer within a reasonable time after the requirement is  
imposed will notify the employee in writing of any reasons, and any facts  
supporting the reasons, that are the basis for the requirement. A copy of the  
notice, with the employee’s personal identifiers deleted, will be delivered to the  
Labor Organization.  
Upon the employee's request, the Employer will meet with the employee to  
discuss a notice provided under paragraph d. The Employer will afford the Labor  
Organization opportunity to attend the meeting unless the employee objects.  
Section 6: Advanced Sick Leave: Sick leave, not to exceed 240 hours at any one time, may be  
advanced to an employee subject to the following:  
so  
Procedures contained in the Supervisor’s Handbook.  
Request for advancement of sick leave will be supported by a medical certificate.  
All available accumulated sick leave will be exhausted before advancement.  
Annual leave that would otherwise be forfeited is used.  
There is reasonable assurance that the employee will return to duty to earn and repay  
advanced credits.  
Section 7: Religious Observances: An employee whose personal religious beliefs require that  
he or she be absent from work during scheduled work periods for religious holidays may be  
allowed to use compensatory time, appropriate leave, or management may reschedule hours to  
accommodate the hours required for the absence.  
Section 8: The Employer and the Labor Organization recognize the importance and  
humanitarian need for community blood donors. When community need for blood donors arise  
and work requirements allow, employees may be released in accordance with TPR 630, Chapter  
12, 12-3,  
40  
Section 9: The Employer and the Labor Organization recognize that any employee called for  
Jury Duty or as a witness on behalf of the Federal, State or Local government will be on official  
duty or court leave in accordance with applicable regulations. The Employee is responsible for  
notifying the employer once they receive notice of Jury Duty. If the employee is released from  
Jury Duty prior to the end of the scheduled work day, they will return to their work station.  
Section 10: Brief absences from duty of less than an hour and tardiness may be excused when  
the reasons are justifiable to the supervisor (ex. lactating mothers expressing breast milk). When  
not justifiable, the absence must be made up or charged to an appropriate leave account.  
Inclement weather procedures will follow The Adjutant General’s Inclement Weather Policy that  
has been negotiated with the Labor Organization through | & | procedures.  
Section 11: Maternity and Paternity Leave:  
a. Employees who are pregnant will be allowed to work as long as they and their physician  
feel it is wise and they are able to perform the duties of their position prior to delivery of the  
child. Maternity leave in the form of sick leave, annual leave, and/or leave without pay will be  
granted during delivery, confinement and for a period determined by attending physician while  
incapacitated for maternity reasons. The employee shall be returned to her position or a like  
position at the end of authorized maternity leave.

and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).  
Section 12: The Employer will provide leave without pay in accordance with the Family and  
Medical Leave Act (FMLA), including but not limited to the care of the employee’s spouse, son,  
daughter, or parent with a serious health condition, or a serious health condition of the employee  
that makes the employee unable to perform the essential function of his/her position.  
Section 13: Excused Absence Leave: Employees shall be granted excused absence for voting in  
National, State, and Municipal elections in accordance with the established policy of the Federal  
Government. The rules for granting excused absence for this purpose are outlined in applicable  
directives of the Federal Government. Other examples for which excused absence may be  
granted are:

that such attendance will serve the public interest  
b. Technicians will be excused, without charge to leave or loss of pay, for periodic,  
baseline, or annual physical examinations as required only for technician duties [AW TPR 630.  
c. For time required to vote where the polls are not open at least three (3) hours before or  
after regularly scheduled duty hours. For employees who vote in jurisdictions which require  
41  
registration in person, time off to register will be granted on substantially the same basis. An  
employee may be excused up to a full day under unusual circumstances where the commuting  
distance, as determined by the supervisor to places of registration is considerable and registration  
is required in person.  
d. For up to four (4) hours in any one day to participate as active pall bearers or as a  
member of firing squads for Military funerals.

### PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS  
### 
Section 1: Introduction: The employer and the Labor Organization recognize the vital nature of  
the performance evaluation process to the entire bargaining unit work force. Therefore, the  
performance evaluation system will be [AW TPR 430 or National Guard Bureau Regulations and  
the CBA. The effectiveness of the performance evaluation system is a combined responsibility  
of each employee and the employer.  
Section 2: Appraisal of Labor Organization Officials: The times spent away from the assigned  
job by Labor Organization representatives in the performance of their representational duties  
should not be taken into account when accomplishing a performance appraisal. But rather, the  
performance appraisal should be based only on the performance of their officially assigned work.  
Section 3: Policy  
a.  
This Article addresses the Technician Performance Appraisal Program as it applies to  
bargaining unit members. Technician Personnel Regulation (TPR) 430 and this CBA are  
used for the administration of the Performance Appraisal Program. The current  
automated program is hosted on the web Application: MyBiz/My Workplace.  
The evaluation of a Technician’s performance of assigned duties is paramount in the  
evaluation process. Items of a disciplinary nature will not be used as part of that  
measurement, unless it occurred and affected performance during the rating period.  
Appeals must be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after the date the Technician  
received the appraisal and will be submitted to the HRO Employee Relations Specialist in  
accordance with TPR 430.  
Section 4: ACTIONS BASED ON UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE  
a.  
The Employer may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance  
in accordance with applicable law or regulations and the following.  
Prior to initiating an action under this Article, the following actions, as referenced in TPR  
430, are required in writing.  
1. Specific instances of unacceptable performance by the technician on which the  
proposed action is based.

available. Selection of employees for temporary duty assignments, in technician status, will be  
based upon official necessity and qualifications of the individual to best perform the mission  
required without regard to sex, race, religion or national origin. So far as necessary in the full  
performance of their position duties, employees are responsible for responding to temporary duty  
assignments in the same manner as to duties at their permanent duty station. The Employer  
agrees to attempt to insure that problems created by TDY assignments will have a minimal  
impact on morale of the individual technician.  
Section 2: Assignment of Qualified Technicians:  
a. Management may receive input from employees in each section pertaining to technician  
TDY assignments. Where management’s decision to assign personnel to technician TDY  
assignments differs from a section’s desires, management will provide a reason to the technicians  
selected. There will be no restriction on an individual participating in technician TDY  
assignments unless a law, rule or regulation prohibits participation. All personnel in each section  
will establish an internal policy/procedure trip roster, written plan, etc), based on individual  
section concerns. In the event of disputes within a section that cannot be resolved, a rotating trip  
roster of eligible employees will be developed and trips will be assigned based on roster position.  
If'an established roster is currently in use it may remain in effect.

engaged on official business. Travel by privately owned vehicles will not be directed but may be

ensure technicians are not required to occupy substandard quarters.  
Section 7; Compensatory Time for travel:

time ts not only “hours worked” on regular workdays, but also during the non-  
workdays. Compensatory time will also be granted for time spent in “standby”  
status when directed by appropriate management official.

hours of work. It is the intent of the parties, in implementing this language, to  
preserve management's right to assign work under 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a)(2)(B) in  
determining whether the scheduling of such travel is during or outside of the  
employee's regular workday is necessary to accomplish the mission.  
Section 8: Home Station Workload: The Employer acknowledges that a TDY may create  
additional workloads for technicians who remain at home station. Every effort will be made to  
keep workloads and special details to a minimum.  
Section 9: Prudence In Travel/Orders: A technician on TDY will exercise the same care in  
incurring expenses and accomplishing a mission that a prudent person would exercise if traveling  
on personal business. Excess costs, circuitous routes, delays or luxury accommodations  
unnecessary or unjustified in the performance of a mission are not considered acceptable as  
exercising prudence. Technicians will be responsible for excess costs and any additional  
expenses incurred for personal preference or convenience. TDY orders will be prepared and  
delivered as early as possible in advance of departure. Orders will be published IAW applicable  
directives/regulations. Civilian status TDY orders will reflect both civilian and military grades
