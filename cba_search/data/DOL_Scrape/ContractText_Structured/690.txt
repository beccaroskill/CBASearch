1. Work performed on Sunday or on a legal holiday listed

such qualified employees. An employee may elect not  
to take his or her turn in rotation, but in such event  
shall not be eligible for Sunday and holiday work until  
it is again his or her turn in the rotation.  
If the Employer cannot staff the store by rotation, the  
Employer may require qualified employees to work in  
an inverse order of seniority.  
In scheduling Sunday and holiday work, the more se-  
—4—  
I

nior employees will not be scheduled for less hours  
than the less senior employees.

Section 11. Except in emergency situations, all employees  
will be given at least ten (10) hours off between work shifts.  
An “emergency situation,” as used in this Section, is a very  
serious and unusual kind of operating problem which creates  
a serious need for manpower.  
if, as a result of a scheduling error, an employee is involun-  
tarily scheduled with less than ten (10) hours off between  
shifts, the employee may have the schedule adjusted to pro-  
vide for such time off with no loss of hours.

al hours are not available, who shall be scheduled a mini-  
mum of five (5) hours. Time and one-half (1%) shall be paid

propriate basic workweek if such work is involuntary and re-  
quired by management.  
Section 14(b). Employees shall be guaranteed four (4)

minors, the guarantee shall be limited to three (3} hours.

1:30 P.M. each Friday for the following week with all em-  
ployees (including anyone on layoff) listed according to se-  
niority showing starting times, quitting times, and the total  
number of hours scheduled for the week. Each employee  
must make known any errors in the schedule by noon on  
Saturday. Employees not working on Friday or Saturday may

are available. Day shifts are defined as any shifts commenc-  
ing no earlier than 6:00 A.M. and ending no later than 6:00  
P.M. The assignment of such shifts shall be by the Employ-  
er. This Section does not apply to night stockers or night  
maintenance employees.  
Section 17. Days off for employees regularly scheduled five  
(5) days per week shall be scheduled by the Employer and  
will not be changed from week to week unless necessitated  
by sickness, vacations, holidays, or emergencies beyond the

Section it is agreed that the Employer will be permit-  
ted to employ such part-time employees as the Employer  
may require for the efficient operation of the store, however,

each individual store. Employees may claim any or all por-  
tions of a less senior employee's schedule up to eight (8)  
hours in a day or forty (40) hours in a week, exclusive of time  
and one-half (1%) hours. Available hours must be claimed to  
the store manager by noon on Saturday following posting of  
the work schedule or the employee forfeits the right to such  
hours. The scheduling and claiming of available hours will  
supersede the minimum guarantee clauses contained in Ar-  
ticle III, Section 14. To the extent practicable, there shall be  
a lapse of two (2) hours between the quitting time of one (1)  
part-time employee and the starting time of another part-time  
employee who is engaged in the same type of work, unless  
the first part-time employee is not available for further work  
The scheduling or claiming of available hours may not cause  
an employee to work a split shift.

protected from available hours claims to the maximum of six-  
teen (16) hours work in the office and sixteen (16) hours on

available to the Union. Employees who are available to work  
only certain hours due to other commitments shall not cause  
a reduction in hours for other employees when such com-  
mitments no tonger interfere with their availability, they will  
have the right to additional hours, in accordance with senior-  
ity, when such additional hours are available.

ments shall not cause a reduction in hours for other employ-  
ees when such commitments no longer interfere with their  
availability; they will have the right to additional hours, in ac-  
cordance with seniority, when such additional hours are  
available.  
The Employer shall approve or disapprove such schedule re-  
strictions based on the needs of the operation, provided that  
the requests will not be unreasonably withheld.

schedule restrictions will be on a case-by-case basis and  
shall not set a precedent in the determination of requests by  
other employees.  
Section 19(a). The Employer shall furnish time clocks in all  
stores covered by this Agreement. Each employee will  
punch his or her own time card and shall follow all rules es-  
tablished by the Employer with respect to time cards and  
time clocks. Employees shall be disciplined by the Employer  
for failure to follow such rules.  
Section 19(b). Where computerized time recording is intro-  
duced, it shall be permitted as an exception to the time card  
provisions, provided that the Store Manager (or acting man-  
ager) shall upon request promptly provide the store's Union  
Representative or Steward with a hard copy of information  
that is comparable to that which could have been obtained  
from the time cards.  
Section 19(c). The Employer agrees that there shall be no  
“free” or “time-off-the-clock” work under this Agreement.  
Section 20. When an employee loses time from his or her  
schedule in any week due to an emergency caused by a Civ-  
il or natural disturbance, any arrangement which may be  
worked out between the Union and Employer to make up all  
or part of such lost time shall be valid under this Agreement.  
When work is offered to an employee under such arrange-  
ment, he or she may accept such work or reject it and lose  
the time.

Section 5(a). Employees who average thirty-seven (37) or  
more hours per week during a vacation year shall be paid  
forty (40) hours for each week of vacation. Leaving work due

tual agreement between the Manager and employee shall  
not reduce vacation entitlement.  
Section 5(b). Vacation pay for employees who average less  
than thirty-seven (37) hours per week during a vacation year  
shalt be calculated by multiplying the hourly rate of an em-  
ployee at the time they take their vacation by the average  
hours per week they were paid in the vacation year. The va-  
cation year is defined as being the twelve (12) month period  
between the anniversaries of the employee's hiring date (for

the three (3) months preceding the date of the injury.  
Section 6. The Employer shail reasonably determine the va-  
cation periods available and the number of employees who  
can be on vacation at any one time. The Employer shall es-  
tablish a reasonable procedure for employees to select va-

sary, vacations which fall due in the twelfth (12th) or thir-  
teenth (13th) periods may be carried over to the first (1st) pe-  
riod of the next year; no employee may be required to take  
pay in lieu of vacation, but may do so by mutual agreement  
between the Employer and the employee. If an employee

Section 12. No employee now receiving a higher rate of pay  
than set forth in this Agreement for such classification shall  
suffer a reduction in wages or salary during the life of this  
Agreement, provided, however, that if an employee is  
changed from one classification to another paying a lower  
rate, such employee shall be paid the rate for the classifica-

Section 13. The Employer agrees that all new employees  
who have had previous comparable work experience in the  
retail food industry and Student Employees who have been  
reclassified on or after September 9, 1990, will be given  
credit for one-half (%) of such experience up to the maximum  
of one (1) year, irrespective of whom they have worked for,  
and their rates of pay shall be based in accordance with such  
credited experience according to the schedule set forth in  
this contract. Such experience shall be recognized by this  
Employer from and after written certification to this Employ-  
er by the Union Representative of United Food and Com-  
mercial Workers Union Local No. 880 or by previous retail  
food employers, providing, however, that there shall be no  
retroactivity in connection with this certification. However, an  
employee must have been engaged in the retail food busi-  
ness during some part of the five (5) years immediately prior  
to his or her employment by this Employer to be entitled to  
the benefits of this Paragraph, and no credit will be given for  
any employment not shown on the application form. When  
the Employer hires a former employee, the Union will not be  
required to notify the Employer of any prior experience with  
that Employer. Reclassified High School Student Employees  
and Porters who are actively employed on August 26, 1990,  
and who, on that date, have less than 2,080 accumulated  
hours for wage progression purposes will receive one-half  
(4) of their previous experience as a High School Student  
Employee added to their accumulated hours up to a total of  
no more than 2,080 hours.  
Section 14. When the employment of an employee is termi-  
nated, the Employer shall upon request, give the employee  
— 30 —  
a statement which shail set forth the date of the  
hire, the date of the employee’s termination, and the total!  
hours worked in specific job classifications during the time in-  
tervening, if available. If total hours worked by the employee  
exceed 6,240 hours, such fact may be stated in lieu of an ac-  
tual accounting of the total hours worked.  
Section 15. An employee working between 10:00 P.M. and  
6:00 A.M. who is not otherwise receiving premium pay for that  
work shall receive a premium of thirty-five cents ($.35) per  
hour for the hours worked between 10:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.  
Section 16. When an employee is designated to lead a night  
stock crew, he or she will be paid a premium of sixty cents  
($.60) per hour for hours worked between 10:00 P.M. and

scribed above.  
Section 17(a). Severance Pay — In the event a Company  
permanently closes a store and employees regularly sched-  
uled for (40) hours per week with at least five (5) years of  
continuous service are terminated as a result of the closing,  
those employees will be entitled to severance pay of one (1)  
week’s regular pay for every two (2) years of service, up toa  
maximum of five (5) weeks’ pay.  
Section 17(b). Severance pay shall be paid in a lump sum  
upon termination. An employee who is terminated and is eli-  
gible for severance pay, and accepts severance pay, forfeits  
his or her seniority and has no recall rights. However, an em-  
ployee may elect a voluntary layoff not to exceed six (6)  
months. If an employee accepts layoff, he or she may at any  
time after a ninety (90) day period elect to take his or her  
severance pay and lose his or her seniority.  
Section 17(c). An employee shall be disqualified for sever-  
ance pay in the event he or she:  
1. Refuses4a transfer within the jurisdiction of the Local  
Union;  
2. Voluntarily terminates employment prior to store clos-  
ing;  
3. Refuses comparable employment with a successor  
employer within thirty (80) days of the store closing.  
Section 18(a). Where Department Heads are designated by  
the Employer, and when such Department Heads are ab-  
sent for one (1) week or more, such jobs will be filled by re-  
placements who will be paid at the prevailing Department  
Head rate.  
Section 18(b). Additional Department Head classifications  
may be formally established by mutual agreement between  
each individual Employer and the Union. Such agreements,  
if reached, would include such matters as the wage premium  
for the Department Head classification over regular wage  
rates, and separate classification seniority. It is understood  
that neither any individual Employer nor the Union can be re-  
— 4 —  
   
a  
ha fe  
quired to agree to the formal establishment of additional De-  
partment Head classifications.  
Section 19. Any employee in any classification who was ac-  
tively employed under the terms of this collective bargaining  
Agreement as of March 13, 1983, and who is later rehired  
or reemployed under the terms of this Agreement by the  
same or a different Employer, shall be considered, when  
placed into a classification which has different wage sched-  
ules for employees hired before or after March 13, 1983, to  
have been hired before March 13, 1983, for the sole purpose  
of determining which wage schedule for that classification is  
applicable to that employee.  
Section 20. The Employer and the Union agree to discuss  
the establishment of programs to utilize internal Revenue  
Service Code Section 125 to allow use of pre-tax earnings  
for child or dependent day care, and programs to secure dis-  
counts with loca! day care facilities.  
Section 21. Manager Trainees are defined as employees  
identified and selected by management to be trained for store  
management responsibilities, and shall be permitted the nec-  
essary flexibility to adequately prepare for store manage-  
ment. Hours worked by management trainees shall not affect  
hours worked by permanent bargaining unit employees, and  
the management training period for any Manager Trainees  
shall not extend beyond two (2) years.

any action by the Trustees of the Fund. The Adminis-  
trative Manager of the Fund shal! consult with the  
Fund's Actuarial Consultant and the President of the

In order to be considered as a grievance under this Article, a  
dispute or grievance shall be submitted to the Employer in  
writing within fourteen (14) days after the occurrence of the  
incident causing such dispute or grievance, or within fourteen

arbitrators. Within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the first  
panel, the Employer and Union may mutually agree to re-

has not been resolved to arbitration on the forty-fifth (45th)

Union must refer a dispute or grievance to arbitration no lat-  
er than thirty (30) days after the last Step 3 meeting is held.  
Section 3. The arbitrator's decision shall be issued within  
thirty (30) days after the dispute or grievance is submitted to  
the arbitrator and shall be final and binding upon the Em-  
ployer, the Union, and the employee or employees involved.  
The expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the  
Employer and the Union.  
Section 4. The time limits specified in Section 1 above may be  
extended by mutual agreement but shall otherwise be en-  
forced in that the dispute or grievance shail be decided against  
any employee or party failing to observe the time limits.

Section 5. In the event a grievance goes to arbitration, this  
Agreement, including any Supplements or Addenda, shall be  
the basis on which the decision is rendered, and  
in reaching his or her decision the arbitrator shall have no au-  
thority to amend, modify, or in any way change its terms.  
Section 6. At any step in this grievance procedure, the Ex-  
ecutive Board of the Local Union shall have fina! authority in  
respect to any aggrieved employees covered by this Agree-  
ment to decline to process further a grievance, complaint,

Board such grievance or dispute lacks merit or justification  
under the terms of this Agreement, or has been adjusted or  
rectified under the terms of this Agreement to the satisfaction  
of the Union Executive Board.  
Section 7. In the investigation and processing of a dispute or  
grievance, the Union and the Employer shall upon request  
provide each other all relevant and pertinent records, pa-  
pers, and data including the names of any and all witnesses

lations and decisions of the Standing Committee shall not be
