Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.  \nEffective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:  \nl.  \nThis Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Credit Year commencing after December 31, 1983,  \nin which, as of the Determination Date,  \na. the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees and  \nb. the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an  \nAggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and the  \naggregate accounts of all Key Employees and non-Key Employees under this Plan and all plans  \nof an Aggregation Group.  \nIf any participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key  \nEmployee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits  \nand/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining  \nwhether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this  \nPlan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31,  \n1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer  \nmaintaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date,  \nthe aggregate account and/or present value of accrued benefit for such Participant or former  \nParticipant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is  \na Top-Heavy Plan.  \nA Participant\u2019s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under applicable  \nprovisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.  \n\u201cAgeregation Group\u201d means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation  \nGroup as hereinafter determined.  \na.

Such group shall be known as a  \n\u201cRequired Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a Top-  \nHeavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Required  \nAggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group Is not a Top-Heavy  \nPlan.  \nb. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required  \nAggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the  \nprovisions of Section 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such group shall be  \nknown as a \u201cPermissive Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required  \nAggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group  \nis a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group wil! be considered a Top-  \nHeavy Pian if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.  \n\u2014 26 \u2014  \n\u00a2. Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan  \nCredit Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.  \n4. In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits shall be  \ndetermined:  \na. as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within a  \ntwelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;  \nb. for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account the  \nestimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.  \nc. forany other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation  \ndate,  \nd. the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit plan  \nminimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan Credit Year.  \n5. The calculation of a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date shall  \nbe the sum of the following:  \na. the present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent  \nvaluation;  \nb. any Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date or  \nwithin four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after the  \nvaluation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  \ndistributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already included  \nin the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions made  \npnorto July J, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated  \nwould have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;  \nc. any Employce contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts attributable  \nto tax deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be considered to be a  \npart of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits;  \nd. with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the  \nEmployee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another  \nEmployer), if this Plan provides for ro!lovers or plan-to-pian transfers, it shall always consider  \nsuch rollover or plan-to-pian transfers as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan  \nis the pan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-pian transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers  \nor plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant\u2019s present value  \nof accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted prior to July 1, 1984,  \nshall be considered as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits; and  \ne. with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the  \nEmployee or made to a pian maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover  \nor plan-to-plan transfer, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this section. If  \nthis the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover  \nor plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits, irrespective  \nof the date on which such rollover Of transfer is accepted.  \nf. \u201cTop-Heavy Group\u201d means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date, the  \nsum of:  \n(1) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans  \nincluded in the group; and  \n(2) the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included in  \nthe group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all Participants.  \ng. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for herein  \nfor the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan Credit Years  \nbeginning after December 31, 1983) shail be extended in accordance with any federal law or  \nregulatory authority.  \nC. Top-Heavy Vesting.  \n1. Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan for any  \nTop-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s accrued benefit shall be  \ndetermined on the basis of the Participant\u2019s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the  \nfollowing schedule:  \nService for Vesting  \n(excluding Years of Service for Vesting  \nprior to effective date of this Plan) Vested percentage  \nI year 0%  \n2 years 0%  \n3 years 100%  \n2. If, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may elect  \nto:  \na. continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s  \naccrued benefit; or  \nb. revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to  \nSection 411(a)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued  \nbenefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and any  \nParticipant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of remaining  \nunder the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a Plan amendment.  \n3. The Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Employee who does not  \nhave one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee\u2019s  \naccrued benefit attributable to Emptoyer contributions will be determined without regard to this  \nArticle.  \nD. Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.  \n1, The minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this section  \nfor each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product of:  \na. one-twelfth (1/12th) of Annual Compensation averaged over the five consecutive \u201climitation  \nyears\u201d (or actual number of \u201climitation years\u201d if less) which produces the highest average, and  \nb. the lesser of  \n\u2014 28 \u2014  \n(1) two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or  \n(2) twenty percent (20%).  \nFor purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code, a  \nNon-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:  \na. his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or  \nb. he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan will be considered to be a Participant.  \nFor purposes of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July  \n1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  \ndisregarded.  \nFor purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any \u201climitation year\u201d ending prior to July 1,  \n1984, or subsequent to the last \u201climitation year\u201d during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  \ndisregarded. The term \u201climitation year\u201d means the Plan Credit Year.  \nIf the Plan provides for the normal retirement benefit to be paid in a form other than a single life  \nannuity, the accrued benefit under this section shali be the Actuarial Equivalence of the minimum  \naccrued benefit under Article V.  \nIf payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement Age,  \nthe minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.  \nif aNon-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included ina Required  \nAggregation Group which is Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under this Plan.  \nTo the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VU of the Plan the minimum accrued benefit  \nunder this section may not be forfeited under Sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 41 1(a)(3)(D) of the Internal  \nRevenue Code.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XIII  \nRight to Amend  \n", "The Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Plan and Trust without the consent of any Participant, at any  \ntime from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no amendment to this Trust shall deprive  \nany Participant of any accrued benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment be contrary  \nto any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust, provided that  \nthe Trustees may adopt an amendment  \nA. necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plan or the Trust Fund under the Internal  \nRevenue Code and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or  \nIf the amendment meets the requirements of Section 302(c)(8) of ERISA and Section 412(c)(8) of the  \nInternal Revenue Code, and the Secretary of Labor has been notified of such amendment and has either  \napproved of it or, within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, has failed to disapprove.  \nEither the Trustees representing the Union or the Trustees representing the Employers may propose amendments  \nto this Trust.

Effective July 1, 1986, for purposes of computing hours for determining whether a one-year break in  \nservice has occurred only, an hour of service includes each hour up to a maximum of 501 hours, during  \na period of absence from covered employment, if the absence from such employment was due to one  \nof the following:  \n\u2014 Fe  \n. Pregnancy of the Participant;  \n2. Birth of a child of the Participant;  \n3. Placement of a child with the Participant in connection with the adoption of such child by the  \nParticipant, or  \n4. Caring for such child by the Participant.  \nThe amount of hours to be credited for the period of absence shall be the number of hours that  \nnormally would be credited to the Participant, but for the absence from covered employment, if such  \nan amount can be ascertained. If this amount is not able to be ascertained, the Participant shall be  \ncredited with eight hours of service for each working day during the leave.  \nThe hours of service shall be credited in the vesting computation year in which they occur, if the leave  \noccurs totally within one vesting computation year. If the leave takes place in more than one vesting  \ncomputation year, the hours of service shall be credited in the vesting year during which the absence  \nbegins, if the crediting is necessary to prevent a break in service, otherwise the hours of service shall  \nbe credited in the following vesting computation year.  \nHours of service under this subparagraph shail be computed only for purposes of determining whether  \na one-year break in service has occurred. Such hours will not be counted toward credited service nor  \nwill they be counted toward determining whcther the Participant has completed a year of service for  \nvesting purposes.  \nThe Participant is required to furnish, upon request by the Plan Administrator or an authorized repre-  \nsentative thereof, such timely information as the Plan may reasonably require to establish that the  \nabsence was for one of the reasons stated in this subparagraph and/or to establish the number of days  \nfor which there was such an absence.  \nE. Effective January |, 1994, an hour of service for purposes of determining whether a Participant has  \ncompleted a year of service for vesting purposes will include hours of service the Participant would  \nhave earned but for his having taken approved leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave  \nAct.

The Benefit Amounts are subject to  \nreduction on account of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VJ) and modification if the Participant  \nretires with an annuity starting date other than his normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the  \nnormal form of benefits.  \nEligibility to receive a benefit based on the Participant\u2019s accrued benefit depends on mecting the conditions for  \nbenefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning Years of Vesting Service and Permanent Break in  \nService (Article VID.  \n5.2 Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of thts Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a 60  \nmonth guarantee.

The  \namount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the  \nactuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month  \nguarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.  \n5.3.

Nor shail the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of  \nretirement or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his beneficiary under other  \nprovisions of this Plan. A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the  \nsame retirement benefits (Preretirement Survivor Annuity, Early Retirement Benefit and Normal  \nRetirement Benefit) in the same form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and  \nelection procedures as he would otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability  \nbenefits.  \n\u201412\u2014  \n6.5 Death Benefit.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term retirement means that  \nthe Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Total and Permanent Disability  \nPayment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not  \nceased under Article III.  \nEffective with respect to Participants who die September 1, 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the re-  \nquirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall  \nnot apply to any Participant who was employed by an employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and  \nPictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an hour of  \nservice.  \nEffective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the re-  \nquirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for Death Benefit only if the Partici-  \npant was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan) a covered Participant for the Death  \nBenefit under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or on Waiver of Premium for Disability under the  \nPainters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust. For  \npurposes of the death benefit for deaths that occur on or after October 1, 1991, it is no longer required that the  \nParticipant shall have been an active Participant in the Painters District Council Pension Plan at the time of his  \nAnnuity Starting Date.  \n6.6 Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity,  \nA. General Rule, A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to  \nthe surviving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22, 1984 but before his Annuity Starting  \nDate, who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the  \ndate of death, and who has met one of the requirements of Article VII and was therefore vested as of  \nthe date of his death.  \nB. Definition, A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse  \nof a Participant who meets the requirements of Section 6.6A computed under Section 6.6C.  \nCc C utation of Oualified Preretirement Survivor Annuit  \n1. If a Participant dics after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that  \nParticipant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving  \nspouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity  \nif the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the  \nParticipant\u2019s death. If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date  \nunder subsection 6.6C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shalf be computed under that  \nsubsection.  \n2. Ifa Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Partici-  \npant, the amount of the Qualified Prerctirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving  \nspouse is the amount which would be payable to the surviving spouse as a suvivor annuity, if the  \nParticipant had:  \na. Separated from service on the day he fast worked in covered employment;  \nb. Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;  \nc. Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and  \nd. Died on the next day.  \nIf, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under subsection 6.6C.4,  \nthe amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.  \n\u201413\u2014  \n   \n6.7  \nA.  \nB.  \nC.  \n3. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse  \nshall-commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:  \na. The date of the Participant\u2019s death, or  \nb. The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applics to that Participant;  \nand shall continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse  \ndies. No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant\u2019s spouse fails to survive to the  \ndate on which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable  \nunder Section 6.7.  \n4, Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to  \nany date on or before the later of:  \na. The Participant\u2019s Normal Retirement Date; or  \nb. The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant\u2019s 62nd birthday.  \nIn the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the  \namount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor  \nannuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before  \nthe deferred Annuity Starttng Date and died the next day. If the Participant\u2019s spouse clects ta defer  \nthe Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting  \nDate, no survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such cvent, benefits may be payable  \nunder Section 6.7.  \n5. The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to  \nthe annuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed  \n$5,000.  \nFor purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan  \nis required to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  \nCorporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.  \nBeneficia nnuit  \nA Beneficiary Annuity, as defined in subsection 6.7B shall be paid to the beneficiary determined under  \nsubsection 6.7C of any Participant who meets either of the fotlowing eligibility requirements:  \n1. A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date but has not met the requirements  \nfor a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity; or  \n2. A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified  \nPreretirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse\u2019s  \nAnnuity Starting Date under the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.  \nThe Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable under the Normal  \nForm of Benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at the Participant\u2019s Normal  \nRetirement Date, provided, however, that this amount is payable to the beneficiary or  \ndetermined under Section 6.7C only for 60 months. Bencfit payments to the benficiary will  \ncommence with the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participant would  \nhave reached age 60 or if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant  \ndies or if later, the first day of the month following the death of the surviving spouse.  \nThe beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same  \nmanner as the beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2, except that if payment is required to be  \nmade under that section to the Participant\u2019s estate and if more than one year has passed since the  \nparticipant\u2019s death, the payments shall be made to the Particitpant\u2019s legal heirs determined under the  \nlaws of intestacy of the State of Missouri as of the date the payments are to commence.  \nThis Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or before  \nJanuary 19, 1995.  \n\u2014 14\u2014  \n"], ["ARTICLE VII  \nVesting Requirements  \n", "7.1.

Such group shall be  \nknown as a \u201cRequired Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a  \nTop-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the  \nRequired Aggregation Group ts a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group  \n1s not a Top-Heavy Plan.  \nb. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required  \nAggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to  \nsatisfy the provisions of Section 401{a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such  \ngroup shall be known as a \u201cPermissive Aggregation Group.\u201d  \nIn the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required  \nAggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Group  \nis a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a  \nTop-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.  \nc. Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan  \nCredit Ycar shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy  \nPlans.  \nIn the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefits shal! be  \ndetermined:  \na. as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within  \na twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;  \nb. for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:  \n\u2014295\u2014  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the Determination Datc; or  \nthe Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account  \nthe estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.  \nfor any other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial  \nvaluation date,  \nthe actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit  \nplan minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan  \nCredit Year.  \nThe calculation of a Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date  \nshall be the sum of the following:  \na.  \nthe present value of accrucd benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent  \nactuarial valuation;  \nany Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date  \nor within four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after  \nthe valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  \ndistributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already  \nincluded in the Participant\u2019s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions  \nmade prior to July |, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been  \nterminated would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;  \nany Employer contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory.

Top-Heavy Vesting.  \n1.  \nZ.  \n3.  \nNotwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan, for  \nany Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s accrued benefit shall be  \ndetermined on the basis of the Participant\u2019s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the  \nfollowing schedule:  \nService for Vesting  \n(excluding Years of  \nService for Vesting  \nprior to effective Vested  \ndate of this Pian) percentage  \n| Year 0%  \n2 years 0%  \n3 years 100%  \nIf, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may  \nelect to:  \na. continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant\u2019s  \naccrued benefit; or  \nrevert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to  \nSection 411(a}(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the  \naccrued benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and  \nany Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of  \nremaining under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a  \nPlan amendment.  \nThe Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Emptoyce who does  \nnot have one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee\u2019s  \naccrued benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this  \nArticle.  \nD.

For purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code,  \na Non-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:  \na.  \nb.  \nhis Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or  \nhe declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan  \nwill be considered to be a Participant.  \n27 \u2014  \n3. For purpose of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July  \n1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top~Heavy Plan shall be  \ndisregarded.  \n4. For purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any \u201climitation year\u201d ending prior to July  \n1, 1984, or subsequent to the last \u201climitation year\u201d during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan  \nshall be disregarded. The term \u201climitation year\u201d means the Plan Credit Year.  \n5. Ifthe Plan provides for the normal retirement to be paid in a form other than a single life annuity,  \nthe accrued benefit under this section shali be the Actuartal Equivalence of the minimum accrued  \nbenefit under Article V.  \n6. If payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement  \nAge, the minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.  \n7. If a Non-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included in a  \nRequired Aggregation Group which 1s Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under  \nthis Plan.  \n8. To the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VII of the Plan, the minimum accrued  \nbenefit under this section may not be forfeited under Section 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D) of the  \nInternal Revenue Code.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XI  \n", "Ri e  \nThe Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Plan and Trust without the consent of any Participant, at any  \ntime from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no amendment to this Trust shall  \ndeprive any Participant of any accrued benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment  \nbe contrary to any Jaws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust,  \nprovided that the Trustees may adopt an amendment.  \nA.
