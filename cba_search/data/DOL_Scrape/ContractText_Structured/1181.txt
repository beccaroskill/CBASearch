or requirements.

and not to be pyramided: Example: if hourly wage is $8.00:  
plus 10¢ fringe, time and one-half overtime rate equals  
$12.00 plus 10¢ fringe. On shift work, contributions paid on  
the same proportionate hourly basis as hours worked to  
hours paid.  
Any Insurance Carrier, Administrator, Consultant, Actuary,  
Fiduciary Agent which may be used shall be selected by com-  
petitive bidding upon invitation by Trustees.  
There shall be no requirement that Employees sent to work  
out side the scope of this Agreement be paid fringes, nor shall  
the Employer be required to duplicate fringe contributions.  
(1) An Employer shall be considered “delinquent” for a par-  
ticular work month if its required report and payment for  
that month are not postmarked on or before the 15th of  
the following month (the “due date”), irrespective of  
whether such delinquency is willful or otherwise.  
(2)  Ifan Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work  
month (as provided in (1) above), they shall be required  
to pay, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an  
amount equal to 15% of the payment otherwise due for  
such work month, it being understood and acknow1-  
edged by the parties that actual damages are extremely  
difficult or impossible to ascertain and that the amount  
so fixed as liquidated damages is reasonable.  
(3) If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular  
work month (as provided in (1) above), as to any of all  
of the Trust Funds, and if the report and the full pay-  
ment due for such work month (including liquidated  
damages) are not postmarked in the office of the Fund  
Administrator on or before the 15th day of the month  
following the applicable due date, such Employer shail  
(in addition to paying the full amount due) be  
required to post in the office of the Fund  
Administrator a cash or surety bond in a form satisfac-  
tory to the Trustees and in the face amount of $30,000,  
which shall cover all of the Trust Funds and assure pay-  
ment of all sums called for by this Agreement in the  
19  
(4)  
()  
(6)  
event of the Employer's subsequent delinquency as to  
any and all of the Trust Funds, and which shall be kept  
in force and maintained in the full face amount for a  
period of not less than 12 consecutive calendar  
months during which no further delinquency has  
occurred on the part of such Employers. The Union  
Shall refuse to supply workers and shall prohibit  
Employees covered by this Agreement from working  
for any such delinquent Employer who fails or refused  
to provide or maintain such bond.  
illustration of clauses (1), (2) and (3): If an  
report and payment for the January work month have  
not been postmarked before February 16, such  
Contractor becomes delinquent at that point and must  
pay the full amount due, plus 15%. If the report and  
the full amount for January (including the 15% liqui-  
dated damages amount) are not postmarked before  
March 16, the Employer must then post a $30,000  
bond in addition to reporting and paying the full  
amount due.  
The delinquent Employer shall also be required to pay  
all costs of collection actually incurred by the Trust  
Funds, including all attorney fees, service fees, filing  
fees, court reporter fees, and all other fees, costs and  
disbursements incurred by or on behalf of the Trust  
Funds in collecting the amount due. Trustees at their  
discretion may reimburse (from the fund) the Unions  
for picketing and bannering expense actually incurred  
by the Union in collecting amounts due the Trust  
Funds, which expenses shall be deemed to be costs of  
collection incurred on behalf of the Trust Funds.  
Each Employer who is required to make payments to  
the Trust Funds shall promptly furnish to the Trustees  
and the Unions, or their authorized agents, on  
demand ali necessary employment and payroll records  
relating to its Employees covered by this Agreement,  
including any other relevant information that may be  
required in connection with the administration of the  
20  
  
(8)  
Any  
Trust Funds. The Trustees, or their authorized agents,  
may examine such employment, or payroll records  
whenever such examination is deemed necessary by  
the Trustees and the Unions, or their authorized  
agents in connection with the proper administration of  
the Trust Funds. If any Employer fails or refuses to fur-  
nish its payroll records to the Trustees and the Unions,  
or their authorized agents upon demand or refuses to  
afford the Trustees, or their authorized agents reason-  
able opportunity to examine the same in accordance  
with standard auditing procedures, the Trustees and  
the Unions may enforce such rights by Jegal action, in  
which event all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees,  
court reporter fees and other legal! costs and disburse-  
ments, as well as the auditing fees and costs incurred  
in conducting such audit, shall be paid by such  
Employer on direction of the ‘Trustees. The Unions  
shall also have the right to take economic action to  
enforce such rights on behalf of the Unions and the  
‘Trustees, and the Trust Funds shall reimburse the  
Unions for picketing and bannering expenses actually  
incurred in enforcing such rights.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10 Settlement  
of Disputes, the failure, refusal or neglect of an  
Employer to report and to pay sums due the Trust  
Funds or otherwise to comply with the terms and provi-  
sions of this Article shall not be subject to arbitration.

provisions of this Agreement establishing rates of pay,

BERS OF THE UNION.

ment upon each anniversary date of the effective date of this  
Contract, and shal! be within the discretion of the Trustees
