TheEmployer agrees that whenever possible at such  \nPre-Job Conference they will notify the Union of any subcon-  \ntracts let by the Employer, the names of the subcontractors,  \nand the nature of the work to be performed by the subcontrac-  \ntors. The Union may request a subcontractor to meet with the  \nUnion and the subcontractor will meet with the Union prior to  \ncommencing work on a project if the subcontractor did not  \nattend the original Pre-Job Conference for the project. It is  \nunderstood and agreed that no agreement may be made at the  \nPre-Job Conference which will in effect change, modify  \nor abrogate the Labor Agreement in effect between the two  \nparties hereto.  \n17. Subject to the provisions and limitations of the Na-  \ntional Labor Relations Act, as amended, all present employees  \nwho are members of the Local Unions above stated on the  \neffective date of this sub-section shall remain members of the  \nLocal Unions in good standing as a condition of employment.  \n7  \n   \n18. All present employees who are not members of the  \nLocal Unions and all employees who are hired hereafter shall  \nbecome and remain members in good standing of any one of  \nSaid Locals as a condition of employment on and after the eighth  \n(8th) day following the effective date of this sub-section or  \nfollowing the beginning of their employment, whichever is later.  \n19. The Employer is to be the sole judge as to the  \nsatisfactory performance of work by an employee and may  \ndischarge any employee whose work is unsatisfactory or who  \nfails to observe the safety precautions or other rules and  \nregulations prescribed by the Employer for the health, safety  \nand protection of his employees. However, no employee shall  \nbe discharged for defending the rights of any employee under  \nthe terms of this Agreement. Any grievance arising through  \napplication of this clause shall be adjusted in accordance with  \nthe procedures outlined in Article X!V, Paragraphs 124, 125  \nand 126 of this Agreement. Intoxication and/or assault commit-  \nted on the job site shall be cause for immediate discharge.  \n20. shall place no limitation upon the amount  \nof work which an employee shall perform during the working  \nday and there shall be no restriction imposed against the use of  \nany type of machinery, tools or labor-saving devices. The  \nEmployer agrees that the work jurisdiction of the Operating  \nEngineers, as assigned by the AFL-CIO, will be respected and  \nail Operating Engineer work will be performed by an Operating  \nEngineer, and it is the intent of both parties that Operating  \nEngineers will be assigned work on the basis that will make  \neach job as productive and efficient as possible. It is agreed  \nthat a fair day\u2019s work shall be given for a fair day's pay.  \n21. The Employer may shift during a work day an Oper-  \nating Engineer from one piece of hourly rate of pay equipment to  \nanother hourly rate of pay piece of equipment without limitation  \nfrom same job site providing the shifting does not interfere with  \nanother Operating Engineer's work day. This condition also per-  \ntains to weekly-pay equipment. However, there shall not be any  \nintermixing with weekly-pay equipment to hourty-pay equipment.  \nThe Operating Engineer will be paid the highest rate for the day.  \nThe District agent in each district, in order to maintain our  \njurisdiction, will make jobs as efficient and productive as possible.  \n22. \\fanEmployerviolates Paragraph 21, the Employer's  \n8  \npenalty shall be to pay the first qualified registered applicant the  \napplicable wage and fringe benefits from the first day of violation.  \n23. Theauthorized representative of the Union shallhave  \naccess to the job during working hours for the purpose of visiting  \nindividual members, adjusting grievances or disputes and such  \nother duties as he may have to perform. The representative will  \nreport to the job supervisor before visiting the project.  \nSTEWARD  \n24. The Union may, when it believes it necessary, ap-  \npoint a Steward whenever possible from Operating Engineers  \nworking on the job and the Union District Repre-  \nsentative will, when making such an appointment, notify the  \nEmployer. The Steward shall perform full-time work for the  \nEmployer and he/she shall be subject to the same rules, rights  \nand working conditions as other employees. Under no circum-  \nstances shall the Steward have any authority to call a strike,  \nstowdown of work or perform any other action which would be  \nin violation of this Agreement.  \n25. The Employer agrees that each new employee shall  \nreport to the job Steward before starting work if a Steward has  \nbeen appointed for that particular Employer's job. The Steward  \nshall be allowed sufficient time during working hours to perform  \nall normal duties required of a Steward. No Steward shall have  \njob priority but will be laid off in the same manner as any other  \nOperating Engineer upon completion of his/her particular job  \nassignment; twenty-four {24} hour notice to the Union prior to  \nhis/her lay off is required to give the Union time to select  \nanother qualified Steward to replace the laid-off Steward, but  \nthis twenty-four (24) hour notice is not required when a Stew-  \nard is discharged for cause by the Employer.  \nSAFETY  \n26. The Union and the Employer will cooperate in the  \nestablishment of a safety program. At the Pre-Job Conference  \nby mutual agreement, the wearing of safety hats may be made  \na condition of employment. All safety equipment required by  \nthe project owner or manager wili be at no cost to the em-  \nployee, except work shoes of any type. Both the Employer and  \nemployees shall comply with the applicable state safety codes  \n9  \nand any other applicable government or civil regulations per-  \ntaining to safety. It is expressly understood that if the employ-  \nees\u2019 immediate health and safety are involved, the Union  \nthrough its representative may order discontinuation of opera-  \ntions until satisfactory results are obtained.  \nTRAINING  \n27. The Safety Training Passport 16-hour program will  \nbe made available to all union members by the Union at no cost  \nto the Employer. The program will consist of:  \nSafety Awareness as required by  \nOSHA 29CFR 1926.21  \nFall Protection as required by OSHA  \n29CFR 1926.503  \nHazard Communication as required by  \nOSHA 29CFR 1926.59  \nOperating Engineers dispatched to a project to perform  \ntrench excavation work will be required to have successfully  \ncompleted eight (8) hours of trench safety training. This pro-  \ngram will become effective May 1, 2007.  \nIt is agreed that both the Employer and the Union will  \nencourage and assist in the promotion of this training.  \n28. Within forty-eight (48) hours after an industrial acci-  \ndent occurs, the company shall have all necessary State  \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation forms available and completed on  \nthe part. A copy of the completed forms shall be  \nSent to the office in the district where the accident  \noccurred.  \n29. All toxic/hazardous projects will be subject to any  \nand all safety regulations and insurance provisions that may be  \nrequired by the appropriate governmental agencies. When  \ndangerous atmospheres are present so that an Operator is  \nrequired to don a special protective suit and/or self-contained  \nbreathing apparatus at a private, state, federal or other desig-  \nnated toxic/hazardous waste site, the Employer will notify the  \nUnion district office. Reasonable dress-up time and clean-up  \ntime will be allowed. The first qualified bargaining unit em-  \nployee on the job willbe designated the steward-safety person,  \nwho shall have access to company monitoring records and be  \nkept informed of amounts of contaminants on the job site. A  \n10  \nsheltered \u201csafe zone\u201d area shall be provided. There shall be  \nwash-up facilities on all toxic/nazardous waste sites. When  \nhazmat training credentials are required, the Operator will  \nreceive a $.50 per hour premium added to his/her base rate.  \nOn such projects, it is expressly understood that if the  \nemployees\u2019 immediate health and safety are in danger, the  \nemployee may discontinue operations, without penalty, until  \nsatisfactory results are obtained, or until such time as a recog-  \nnized safety agent shall declare the equipment or operation to  \nbe safe. Ail Operating Engineers employees shall be advised  \nby the Employer prior to employment as to the nature of the  \nknown hazardous waste and possible resultant physical  \ninjuries as may be required by applicable law.  \n30. DRUG TESTING: The Employer and the Union are  \ncommitted to a policy that promotes safety in the work place,  \nemployes health, and well being. In consideration of this policy,  \nthe Union and Employer agree that any employee found to be  \nunder the influence of, in possession of, or engaged in the  \ndistribution of drugs or alcohol on the job site shall be subject to  \ndisciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.  \nWithin two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new  \nOperator may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a  \nprescription drug which may impair mental or motor function  \nshall inform their supervisor in writing of such drug use.  \nEmployee involvement with drugs and alcohol can  \nadversely affect job performance and employee morale. Inthe  \nConstruction Industry the consequences of drug or alcohol use  \nor influence while on the job site can be disastrous. The  \nEmployer and Union, therefore, agree to the following policy to  \ninsure all employees of a safe and efficient job site free fromthe  \neffects of drug and alcohol use or influence.  \nAll job sites or work areas are subject to random or  \nmassive drug screening. Any employee who is involved in an  \non-the-job accident resulting in an injury to aperson or property  \nor whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion of  \nprobable cause of illegal drug or alcohol use impairment while  \non the job site, may be required as a condition of continued  \nemployment to submit to a test for alcoho! and/or illegal drug  \nuse which impairs the employee's ability to safely perform  \nhis/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a  \nsampling of the employee\u2019s blood, urine, or breath. Any em-  \n1  \nployee who is asked to submit to such a test will be required to  \nsign a consent form. If an employee who is asked to submit to  \na test refuses to do so, or refuses to sign the necessary consent  \nform, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to  \nand including discharge. Refusal to take a test or the submis-  \nsion of an adulterated sample shall be determined the same as  \n@ positive test result. The employee/member shall follow all  \nrequirements outlined in this section.  \nAll testing will be done by a reliable, established labora-  \ntory. If this initial test screen result indicates positive findings,  \nfurther testing of the same sample must be done to confirm the  \noriginal findings before the laboratory can report a positive  \nfinding. The confirmation test will be conducted by an indepen-  \ndent accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of  \nAmerican Pathology Laboratory and will utilize the more scien-  \ntific Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry examination  \n(GC/MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential  \nbetween the employee, the Employer and the Union. The  \nemployee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wage and fringes  \nfor time required for drug testing provided results are negative.  \nIf the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee may  \nbe granted a leave of absence for the purposes of drug and  \nalcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible such rehabili-  \ntation programs are covered under the Ohio Operating  \nEngineers Health and Welfare Program providing the em-  \nployee confines his/her self to a twenty-four (24) hour licensed  \nrehabilitation medical facility.  \nUntil the employee presents certification of successful  \ncompletion of the rehabilitation program, he/she shall be re-  \nmoved from the Employer's job site; shall be prohibited from  \nregistering under Article [Il of the referral of this contract and  \nshall not be dispatched to work. Upon presentation of certifica-  \ntion of the employee\u2019s successful completion of the drug/alcohol  \nrehabilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her  \noriginal job with the Employer. If the employee is not restored to  \ntheir original job, the employee will be allowed to register for work  \nin the referral by registering a new work referral card. The  \nemployee shall, under either circumstance, for the next suc-  \nceeding twelve (12) month period, present to the District Repre-  \nsentative monthly certification of negative drug/alcohol test re-  \nsults. Failure to do so will result in denying the employee the right  \n12  \nto maintain his/her referral card in the register and utilize the  \nreferral or if working, to be removed from work.  \n31. Harassment Policy: The parties to this Agreement  \nmutually agree that harassment of any nature is not to be  \ntolerated. Every person working under this Agreement shall  \nimmediately notify the Employer when a possibility of a prob-  \nlem happens or exists.  \n"], ["ARTICLE Ill  \nREFERRAL SYSTEM  \n", "32. Local 18 and its Branches, shall maintain registers  \nof all applicants for referral. Applicants shall not be permitted to  \nbe registered in more than one office of the Union at any one  \ntime. All applicants will be registered in order of application,  \nprovided no person shall be deemed to be an applicant who is  \notherwise gainfully employed as an Operating Engineer or not  \nimmediately available for work. Registrations and re-registra-  \ntions will be accepted during customary business hours. Appli-  \ncants shall be classified in priority groups in accordance with  \nthe following criteria:  \nGROUP A: All applicants who have worked as Operating  \nEngineers at least 360 days, 90 days or more per year during  \nthe last four (4) years, and have been employed for at least 360  \ndays, 90 days or more per year during the last four (4) years on  \nwork as defined in Article | of this Agreement within the geo-  \ngraphical jurisdiction of Local 18, and who have lived in the  \nState of Ohio, or in any county contiguous thereto, for at least  \none (1) year prior to application.  \nGROUP A PREFERRED: Must have Group A eligibility.  \nGroup A registrants may voluntarily register in the Group A  \nPreferred, however, registrants in this Preferred A status shall  \nhave at least fifteen (15) years employment or availability for  \nemployment in any one or more of the classifications contained  \nin this Agreement and in the type or kind of craft work covered  \nby this Agreement in the geographic area as defined by this  \nAgreement. Referral in this group is limited to the following  \ndescribed equipment and wiil be given priority of referral from  \nthe Group A Preferred deck. Preferred A status employees will  \nnot be eligible for letter of request by the Employer: Welding  \nMachines, Elevator, Conveyor, Pumps, Compressors, Gen-  \n13  \nerators, One Drum Hoist, Mono-Rail Hoist and Portable Heat-  \ners.  \nit is further understood and agreed that when the  \nEmployer employs Operating Engineers not currently in their  \nemploy for any machines listed in this section, the Employer  \nshail call the referral office servicing his/her job or project and  \nrequest that an employee qualifying under the Preferred A  \nStatus be dispatched to service and operate said machine. Any  \nOperating Engineer currently employed by an Employer can be  \nused to operate any of the above listed machines. Apprentices  \nshall not operate this equipment more than fifteen (15) days.  \nWorkmen registering in this Preferred A Group shall be  \nineligible to register in any other group and shall not work in any  \nclassification other than those specified in this section and only  \nhave recall rights for equipment specified in this section.  \nGROUP A RETIREES: Must have Group A eligibility. The  \npension was set up to enhance the lives of retirees in their golden  \nyears. Retiring from the trades is by voluntary choice.  \nA retiree is an equipment operator or mechanic who has  \napplied for and is receiving a pension from any construction  \nindustry source.  \nUpon retirement the retiree can onty register in this group.  \nThe Group A retirees will be referred to jobs only after the  \nGroup A classification and the Preferred A classification have  \nbeen exhausted.  \nThe Group A retirees will not be eligible for letter of  \nrequest by the Employer.  \nGROUP B: Same as Group A, except that the employ-  \nment shall have been at least 270 days, three (3) years of 90  \ndays each. All fourth year Apprentices and Trainees shall be  \nregistered in this group.  \nGROUP C: All applicants who have worked as Operating  \nEngineers at least ninety (90) days per year during each of the  \nlast two (2) years, and who have lived in the State of Ohio or any  \ncounty contiguous thereto for at least one (1) year prior to  \napplication. All third year Apprentices and Trainees shall be  \nregistered in this group.  \nGROUP D: All applicants who have worked as Operating  \nEngineers at least ninety (90) days during the twelve (12)  \nmonths prior to application. All second year Apprentices and  \nTrainees shall be registered in this group.  \n14  \nGROUP E: All other applicants and all first year Appren-  \ntices and Trainees shall be registered in this group.  \nGROUP F: Ail applicants who are \u201ctemporary employees.\u201d  \nAll applicants who have attained eligibility in any of the  \nforegoing groups shail not lose eligibility as a result of their  \nfailure to obtain the required days of employment during the  \napplicable periods of time. All graduating Apprentices shall  \nupon journeymen certification become eligible for Group A.  \nWhen an applicant fails to register in his/her eligibility group  \ndue to reasons other than illness, as hereinafter defined, and  \ndoes not notify the Union Hall, the resultant failure to obtain the  \nrequired days of employment during the applicable periods of  \ntime shall cause the applicant to lose eligibility in that group.  \nAny registrant requesting that their work registration card  \nbe placed on hold due to sickness or ill health must present to  \nthe Union a doctor\u2019s certificate or statement certifying that the  \nregistrant will be under a doctor\u2019s care for a minimum of thirty  \n(30) days, and that such illness prevents the registered appli-  \ncant from working as an Operating Engineer. A work  \ncard will only be placed on hold for a minimum  \nperiod of thirty (30) days, and a maximum period of one  \nhundred twenty (120) days. No registration cards willbe placed  \nin the hold position for illness less than a thirty (30) day  \nduration. Any refusals of dispatches due to illness for a period  \nof less than thirty (30) days shall be counted as a refusal under  \nthe terms and conditions of the referral procedure.  \n33. Inreferring applicants, the following procedure shall  \nbe followed:  \nA. Applicants in Group A shall first be referred, and then  \nGroup A Preferred, then Group A Retirees, then applicants in  \nthe succeeding groups, in order, through Group E. In each  \ngroup, the Union shall refer applicants in order of their places  \non the referral list.  \nB. Registered Apprentices or Trainees shall be referred  \nin order of their position on the referral tist.  \nC. Employers shall have the right to reject any applicant  \nreferred for employment and shall immediately notify the Union  \nin writing of such rejection. In the event a registrant is dis-  \ncharged by the Employer because of lack of sufficient ability,  \n15  \nand he/she does not exercise his/her rights under the Referral  \nBoard of Review and Arbitration under Paragraph 37, the  \nclassification or equipment from which he/she is discharged  \nshall be stricken from his/her referral record and he/she shall  \nnot be dispatched to a job in that classification or on that  \nequipment until he/she has:  \n1. Taken training at his/her training site and has been  \ncertified, or  \n2. Has presented to his/her dispatch office a letter from  \na previous Employer, in signed agreement with Local 18 work-  \ning within Local 18\u2019s jurisdiction, stating that in the  \nopinion the discharged registrant has successfully completed  \na job assignment in that classification or on that piece of  \nequipment in his employment.  \nD. actually employed, he/she shall  \nnotify the Union office at which he/she is registered within  \ntwenty-four (24) hours. Fatlure to do so is an imposition upon  \nthose registered and not employed and, therefore, such appli-  \ncant will be barred from re-registering, unless and until he/she  \nhas made application to the Board of Review and Arbitration  \nprovided for in Paragraph 37 of this Agreement, and shows  \ngood cause for his/her failure to give such notice.  \nF. When an applicant becomes employed, his/her  \nname shall be removed from the register as soon as he/she  \nshall have worked for a total of thirty-one (31) accumulative  \nworking days (one (1) day jobs shall not count). An Operator  \nwho relieves another Operator will not be charged for the first  \nfifteen (15) days (only one (1) fifteen (15) day relief per registra-  \ntion application card). All days after that will be counted toward  \nhis/her time.  \nlf an applicant is employed for less than thirty-one (31)  \naccumulative working days, he/she shall be restored to his/her  \nprevious position on the register when such employment termi-  \nnates. Any applicant who quits employment or fails to show up  \nfor work assignment at starting time after being dispatched  \n(provided he/she was dispatched the previous day), for what-  \never reason, except accident verified by police report, shall be  \nplaced at the bottom of the applicable registration group re-  \ngardless of the number of days worked and shall not be eligible  \n16  \nfor request until he/she puts in a new registration card. When  \nreason for employment termination is questioned, applicant  \nmust present a written termination slip evidencing reasons  \nother than a voluntary quit before he/she is restored to his/her  \nprevious position on the register.  \nAn applicant for employment may not refuse referral to  \nemployment for any reason except that the applicant may  \ninform the District Office in writing, before any referral, that he/  \nshe will not accept employment referrals in certain named  \ncounties within the District. If an applicant refuses a job referral  \nfor the second consecutive time, he/she shail lose his/her  \nposition on the register and go to the bottom of the list for his/  \nher group.\u201d If the dispatcher is unable to contact an applicant,  \nthe failure to contact shall not be deemed to be a refusal.  \nF. Applicants must notify the Union office in which they  \nare registered by telephone, or letter, or telegram, or in person  \nof their continued availability for employment within thirty (30)  \ndays after the date of last registration or re-registration in order  \nto maintain their places on the register.  \nIn order to equally distribute and defray the cost of ser-  \nvices rendered by the use of this referral system, all individuats  \nwho make use of this referral system shall be required to pay an  \ninitial registration fee of $16.75 and another $16.75 for each re-  \nregistration thereafter, provided that such fee shall not exceed  \n$16.75 in any consecutive thirty (30) day period (the aforestated  \n$16.75 will increase to $17.25 effective July 1, 2005) and  \nprovided that such fee shall not apply to the following:  \n1. Members in good standing of Local 18 or its Branches,  \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers, whose proportionate  \nshare of the cost of this referral system is met by their regular dues; and  \n2. Applicants for membership to Local 18 or its Branches,  \nInternational Union of Operating Engineers, whose proportionate  \nshare of the cost of this referral system is met by their fees; and  \n3. Members in good standing of the International Union  \nof Operating Engineers who are paying trave! dues whose  \nproportionate share of the cost of this referral system is met by  \nthe payment of their fees.  \n\"Does not apply to the Ohio or Kentucky Building & Light Commercial  \nAgreements Referral.  \n17  \nG. shall use its best efforts to notify all registered  \napplicants when work is available for them, but the Union assumes  \nno responsibility or obligation for failure to locate an applicant.  \nH. All applicants must submit a written resume of their  \nexperience and qualifications at the time of original registra-  \ntions, and may be tested on the equipment they operate at the  \nnearest available training site prior to being assigned a posi-  \ntion on the referral list.  \n|. Subject to this referral system Employers may hire  \nthrough this referral policy, by name, former employees who  \nhave resided for at least twenty-four (24} months in the State  \nof Ohio or in any county contiguous thereto, and have been  \nemployed by the Employer making the request during the past  \ntwenty-four (24) months within the jurisdiction of this Agree-  \nment. The Employer must make the request to the appropriate  \nUnion District Office and the employee requested must be  \nregistered on the District referral jist (Groups A through E).  \nEmployers may hire through this referral policy by name  \nindividuals in Group A for a production machine, or for a  \nmechanic, or mechanic/welder, who has been registered on  \nthe out-of-work list for at least ten (10) days in the District in  \nwhich the work is to be performed. Individuals shall have only  \none (1) request per four (4) month period from the last request.  \nThe request by name must be confirmed later in writing on the  \nletterhead of the Employer and signed by either the Employer  \nor the superintendent of the project.  \nNothing in the referral procedure shall interfere with the  \ntransfer of an Employer's employees on his payroll from one  \nproject to another project within the geographical area covered  \nby Local 18. When transferring employees, the Employer will  \nnotify the Union District Office from which the employee is to be  \ntransferred.  \nThe Union agrees the transfer will be processed in an  \nexpedient manner.  \nJ. The purpose of the referral system is to provide nondis-  \ncriminatory employment opportunities. Individuals who register  \ntherein deserve a preference over those who do not. Therefore, it  \nis agreed that in the event that the referral list is exhausted and the  \nUnion is temporarily unable to furnish qualified applicants within  \ntwenty-four (24) hours after receiving the request  \n18  \n(Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted), the Employer may  \ntemporarily employ others until the Union notifies the Employer  \nthat it has qualified registrants available for employment.  \nApplicants hired by the Employer under this procedure  \nshall be known as \u201ctemporary employees,\u201d and will be subject to  \nreplacements. The Employer will notify the Union District Repre-  \nsentative of the name, union affiliation (if any), date of employ-  \nment and social security number of such \u201ctemporary employee.\u201d  \nThe Union will maintain a register of all such \u201ctemporary ernploy-  \nees\u201d and such register shall be known as the temporary register.  \nSuch \u201ctemporary employees\u201d may also be referred by the Union  \n(when the referral list is exhausted) from Group F.  \nSuch \u201ctemporary employee\u201d shall be subject to replace-  \nment by a qualified registered applicant under the procedure  \nlisted herein:  \n1. The Union shall give a five (5) working day written  \nnotice to the Employer with whom the \u201ctemporary employee\u201d is  \nworking and such \u201ctemporary employee\u201d will thereupon be  \nreplaced at the end of the five (5) working day period provided  \nthe Union furnishes a qualified registered applicant.  \n2. The Union will save the Employer harmless for any  \nliabilities occurring under the application of the provisions of  \nthe temporary register.  \nK. When an Employer states requirements for special  \nskills or abilities in his/her request for employee applicants, the  \nUnion shall refer the first applicant on the register possessing  \nsuch skills or abilities, regardless of the place or classification  \nof such applicant on the register. If a contractor requests or  \nrequires that the operator be a Certified Operator, verification  \nof the operator's certification is the responsibility of the Em-  \nployer. If the Employer notifies the Union in writing, within thirty  \n(30) days of the employee\u2019s discharge, of an Operator who  \nhad been in his employment and who had not performed  \nsatisfactorily, and the Employer does not wish this Operator to  \nbe referred to the Employer for future employment, the Union  \nshall honor this written request.  \nL. Any employee who quits a contractor without proper  \nnotice and is subsequently hired by an Employer with whom  \nLocal 18 has a contractual relationship without a proper referral  \nby Local 18 shall be discharged by the Employer when it is  \ncalled to his attention.  \n19  \n34. Employers shall give first opportunity to persons  \nregistered for employment, as provided herein, by calling or  \nnotifying the Union at any of its offices in the territory where the  \nwork is to be performed.  \n35. Registration of applicants and selections of appli-  \ncants for referral to jobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis  \nand shall not be based on or in any way affected by Union  \nmembership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provi-  \nsions, or any other aspects or obligation of Union membership,  \npolicies, or requirements. Itis mutually agreed that the Employer  \nand the Union shall abide by all of the laws of the United States,  \nthe State of Ohio, the Commonweaith of Kentucky, and lawful  \norders thereof in nondiscrimination and fair employment practices.  \nThe Employer and the Union shall not discriminate against  \nnor limit employment opportunities of any employee, applicant  \nfor employment or applicant for Union membership or appren-  \nticeship training because of race, color, sex, age, religion,  \nnational origin or ancestry.  \nThe Union agrees to furnish an Employer, at his request,  \nany statement or data required under any regulations re-  \nferred to herein.  \n36. In addition to the above Registration Groups there  \nestablished a Short Term Job Group. The sole purpose  \nof this Short Term Job Group is to enable registrants to acquire  \ntime to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Registration in  \nthis group is limited to applicants eligible for Group A of this  \nreferral and all fourth year Apprentices showing proof of need  \nfor additional time to qualify for unemployment benefits.  \nApplicants\u2019 referral out of the Short Term Job Group will  \nbe limited to jobs of two (2) days or less duration in a calendar  \nweek or eight (8) days or less duration in a calendar month on  \nequipment listed on their registration cards. Any refusals of  \njobs will cause the registrant's card to be removed from the  \nShort Term Job Group deck. Dispatches for short term jobs as  \ndefined above will first be made from the Short Term Job  \nGroup. If the dispatcher is unable to fill the short term job order  \nfrom the Short Term Job Group he/she will proceed to fitl the  \norder from Groups A through F in accordance with the referral  \nrules. Dispatcher should notify Employers when dispatching  \nfrom the Short Term Job Group. The Employer reserves the  \nright to request dispatch from Group A.  \n20  \nSince this Short Term Job Group is intended to provide limited  \nemployment for those needing credit for unemployment compen-  \nsation, the Union shall, through its business agents, remove from  \nemployment any Operating Engineer who has accumulated more  \nthan two (2) days per calendar week or over eight (8) days in a  \ncalendar month\u2014as a result of the Short Term Job Referral Group.  \nRegistrants in the Short Term Job Group will not be  \neligible for any recall or request provisions of the referral as  \nherein described. Employment received asa result of the Short  \nTerm Job Group referral will not provide eligibility for Employer  \nrecall when the registered in Group A, Preferred A,  \nor Group A Retirees deck. Apprentices or Trainees will not be  \npermitted to register in the Short Term Job Group except as  \nnoted above. Registrants may not register in the Short Term  \nJob Group or Group Aor Preferred A or Group A Retirees deck  \nat the same time. The Employer shall not be permitted to  \ntransfer employees dispatched from the Short Term Job Group  \nfrom one project to another project.  \nThe Union will save the Empioyer harmless for any liabili-  \nties occurring under the application of the provisions of the  \nShort Term Job Group.  \nAll the remaining rules with regard to the operation of the  \nreferral shall be applicable to the operation of the Group A,  \nPreferred A and Group A Retirees except as modified above.  \n37. Any registrant or any Employer who may feel ag-  \ngrieved by the operation of this referral system shall have the  \nright to and mustfile his/her grievance, in writing, (10)  \ndays after the occurrence of the event concerning which he/  \nshe complains with a Board of Review and Arbitration consist-  \ning of one (1) representative of the Union, one (1) representa-  \ntive of the Employer, and an impartial third member to be  \nselected by agreement of the Union and the Employer, and the  \ndecision of this Board shall be final and binding on all parties.  \n38, This statement as to referrals shall be posted in all  \nplaces where notices to Employers and applicants for employ-  \nment are customarily posted, including all offices of the Union;  \nall offices of the Employer.  \n49. A Labor Relations Division Representative of the  \nAGC of Ohio may inspect the referral register at the Union  \nDistrict Office at any time during normal office hours.  \n21  \n40. Allofficers and business representatives of the Union  \nwho have had previous work experience in any one or more of  \nthe job classifications contained in this Agreement shalt be  \ndeemed to be employed at the trade and it is the intent of this  \nsection to provide that upon return to the employment in  \nthe trade, he shall do so with the same preference as if he  \nhad continually worked at the trade and shail be eligible upon  \nregistration for Group A.  \n"], ["ARTICLE IV  \nFRINGE BENEFIT PROGRAMS  \n", "41. The fringe benefit provisions contained herein shall  \napply to all Employer members of the AGC of Ohio Labor  \nRelations Division, and Employers who become signatory or  \nbound by this Agreement, as well as any other Employer or  \nEmployer groups who become a party to an Agreement cover-  \ning the fringe benefit programs set forth herein.  \n42.
