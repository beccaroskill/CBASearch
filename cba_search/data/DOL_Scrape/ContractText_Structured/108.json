The Union shall maintain a register  \nof applicants for employment based upon one or more of the following elements:  \nlength of unemployment; experience; ability; prior work for the requesting Employer;  \nand availability to work in the geographical area of the job. Each applicant for  \nemployment shall be registered in the highest Group for which they qualify, as  \nincluded in Appendix  \nB, no Employer who is delinquent in Trust contributions shall be allowed to directly  \nhire employees outside the Referral Procedure.  \nIt shall be the responsibility of the Contractors, when requesting applicants to notify  \nthe Laborer that they are being requested, and to give the Union all of the pertinent  \ninformation regarding the applicants\u2019 employment.  \nThe first Laborer hired shall be selected by the Employer.

All Laborers hired by the Employer must be registered at the  \ndispatching office of the Local Union prior to employment and receive a dispatch slip  \nfrom the Local Union. Any abuse of this clause shall\u2018be cause for depriving the  \nEmployer of the above-mentioned selection rights for a period of six months.

The parties also recognize that in some instances involving work to be  \nperformed for public authorities, preference must be given to an applicant residing in  \nthe area in which the work is located.
