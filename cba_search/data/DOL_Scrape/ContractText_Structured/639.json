[["", "   \n\u201cWeingarten Rights\u201d  \nQuestion: Who is Weingarten?  \nAnswer: \u201cWeingarten\u201d is the name of a Supreme Court case - NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Ine, (1975) -  \nthat established the right of an employce to the presence of a union representative during an  \ninvestigatory interview.  \n   \nuestion: What is an \u201cinvestigatory interview\"?  \ng  \nAnswer: An investigatory interview, or Company interrogation, occurs when a supervisor questions  \nan employee to obtain information which could be used as a basis for discipline, or asks an employee  \nto defend his or her conduct. If an employee has a reasonable belief that discipline or other adverse  \nconsequences may result from what he or she says, the employee has a right to request union  \nrepresentation.  \nQuestion: What are the Weingarten Rules?  \nAnswer: Under the Supreme Court\u2019s Weingarten decision, when an investigatory interview occurs,  \nthe following rules apply:  \nRULE 1. The employee must make a clear request for union representation before or  \nduring the interview. The employee cannot be punished for making this request.  \nRULE 2. After the employee makes the request, the employer must choose from among  \nthree options. The must either:  \na, Grant the request and delay questioning unti! the union representative arrives and has  \na chance to consult privately with the employce; or  \nb. Deny the request and end the interview immediately;  \nGive the employee a choice of: (1) having the interview without representation or (2)  \nending the interview.  \nRULE 3. If the employer denies the request for union representation and continues to  \nask questions, it commits an unfair labor practice and the employee has a right to refuse to answer.  \nThe employer may not discipline the employee for such a refusal.  \nSource: \u201cThe Legal Rights of Union Stewards\u201d; Robert M.
