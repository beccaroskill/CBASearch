If it is not legally permissible to reallocate the deferred or cut back portion, the Employer shall  \ncommence paying the wage and/or benefit rate that was deferred or cut back when and if it becomes  \nlegally permissible to do so, to the fullest extent permitted by law.  \n4.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly  \nacknowledged and agreed that the Participating Employer shall have no responsibility or obligation  \nto increase its contributions to the Trust Fund beyond that otherwise expressly provided for herein.  \nIt is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that the Participating Employer does not  \nguarantee any benefits to any participant or beneficiary; the obligation and responsibility of the  \nParticipating Employer being expressly limited to its obligation to make agreed contributions into  \nthe Trust Fund.  \n5.
