Letters of Understanding  
@e Health Insurance COMMIUHEE AQ

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT  
This is an Agreement made and entered into effective February 24, 2011 by and between the  
undersigned Abbott Northwestern Hospital, hereinafter referred to as the “Hospital” or the  
“Employer,” and the Professional Employee Pharmacists of Minnesota, a Division of SEIU  
Healthcare Minnesota hereinafter referred to as the “Union” or “SEIU,” as follows:  

### ARTICLE 1: RECOGNITION  
### 
The Hospital recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative for all Registered  
Pharmacists (regardless of educational degree), hereinafter referred to as “pharmacist(s)” or  
“employee(s),” excluding supervisors, interns, pharmacists working less than twenty (20) hours  
per pay period unless hired on or after November 1, 2000, and all other employees. All  
Pharmacists hired on or after November 1, 2000, regardless of hours worked, shall be included in  
the bargaining unit but will not be required to pay union dues unless they work 20 hours or more  
per pay period.  
If the Hospital or Union determines that a pharmacist, who has been treated as part of the  
bargaining unit, is performing duties that make the pharmacist a supervisor under the National  
Labor Relations Act, the party making this determination must notify the other party in writing.  
Upon written notification, the parties will meet to discuss the proper bargaining unit/supervisory  
status of the pharmacist. A resolution of the pharmacist’s status could include either removing  
the supervisory duties for the pharmacist or excluding the pharmacist from the unit.  

### ARTICLE 2: MANAGEMENT RIGHTS  
### 
Except as specifically limited by the express written provisions of this Agreement, the  
management of the Hospital and the direction of the working forces shall be vested solely and  
exclusively in the Hospital. This provision shall include, but is not limited to, the right to hire; to  
determine the quality and quantity of work performed; to determine the number of employees to  
be employed; to lay off employees; to assign and delegate work; to enter into contract for the  
furnishing and purchasing of supplies and services; to maintain and improve efficiency; to  
require observance of Hospital rules, regulations, retirement and other policies; to discipline or  
discharge employees for cause; to schedule work and to determine the number of hours to be  
worked; to determine the methods and equipment to be utilized and the type of service to be  
provided; and to change, modify or discontinue existing methods of service and equipment to be  
used or provided. It is understood that the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of  
this Article will at no time involve the violation of federal or state laws, rules or regulations  
pertaining to the practice of pharmacy or standards adopted or accepted by the Minnesota State  
Board of Pharmacy.  

### ARTICLE 3: WAGES  
### 
3.1 Wage Scale: The minimum hourly rates of pay for the classifications covered by this  
Agreement shall be as follows:  
Length of Service Effective 1/1/2011 Effective 1/1/2012 Effective 1/1/2013  
Start $52.80 $53.33 $53.86  
1 year $53.78 $54.32 $54.86  
3 years $54.74 $55.29 $59.04  
9 year $55.73 $56.29 $56.85  
8 years $57.03 $57.61 $58.18  
10 years $59.59 $60.19 $60.79  
Per Diem $60.27 $60.87 $61.48  
Employees will advance one year on the wage scale as of their date of hire.  
Experience Credit: For purposes of initial placement on the wage scale, a pharmacist will  
receive credit on a year-for-year basis for each year of work (0.5 FTE or above) as a pharmacist  
in the United States in a hospital, retail pharmacy, or residency program, provided that there was  
no break in the pharmacist’s practice between the prior experience and employment in the  
bargaining unit. If there is a break in practice, credit will only be granted from the date the break  
ends to the time the employee joins the Hospital. At the Hospital’s discretion, a pharmacist may  
also receive experience credit for prior experience outside a hospital, retail pharmacy, or  
residency program, other alternative site programs, experience prior to a break in practice, and  
experience where the employee worked less than 0.5 FTE.  
3.2 Longevity Bonus:  
A. An annual longevity bonus will be paid to benefit eligible pharmacists who have  
reached 15 or more years of longevity credit based on the following criteria:  
(1) Hired before January 1, 2003: the longevity credit equals experience  
credit granted at date of hire, plus years worked since date of hire in  
current bargaining unit pharmacist position.  
(2) Hired on or after January 1, 2003: the longevity credit equals continuous  
years of service at Allina as a bargaining unit pharmacist. Experience  
credit is not applicable to longevity credit in this scenario.  
(3) Non-benefit eligible pharmacists: years of service will be credited  
towards eligibility for the longevity bonus in the event the employee later  
becomes benefit eligible.  
4.1  
4.2  
4.3  
4.4  
B. Methodology and timing of longevity bonus:  
(1) 15 - 19 years of longevity credit  
Bonus equals: [FTE* x 2080] x .75% x hourly rate of pay  
(2)  20- 24 years of longevity credit  
Bonus equals: [FTE* x 2080] x 1.5% x hourly rate of pay  
(3) 25 plus years of longevity credit  
Bonus equals: [FTE* x 2080] x 2.0% x hourly rate of pay  
* FTE appointment at anniversary date  
(2) The annual longevity bonus will be calculated on the employee’s  
anniversary date. The longevity bonus will be included in the  
paycheck for the first full pay period of the calendar quarter following the  
anniversary date.  

### ARTICLE 4: HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME  
### 
The basic work period shall be eighty (80) hours to be worked during a period of two (2)  
weeks [fourteen (14) consecutive days]. The normal workday will be eight (8) hours.  
An employee will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times her/his regular rate  
of pay for hours worked in excess of eighty (80) hours during the said two (2) week  
period, or in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday. An employee will be paid at two  
(2) times her/his regular rate for hours worked in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours  
in any shift. Overtime payments shall not be duplicated for hours worked in excess of  
eight (8) in a regular workday and in excess of eighty (80) in a two-week work period or  
in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours. Paid sick leave, holidays, and vacation hours  
Shall be considered as hours of work for overtime purposes.  
The Hospital and Union may mutually agree to overtime payments at the rate set forth  
above on the basis of time worked in excess of forty (40) hours during any one (1) week  
[seven (7) consecutive days]. If such method of payment is used, no overtime shall be  
paid for time worked in excess of eight (8) hours during a workday.  
An employee who is called to work an unscheduled shift and who is called not later than  
one-half (1/2) hour after the commencement of that shift shall be paid for the entire shift  
if she/he arrives within a reasonable period of time after being called.  
Additional intermittent hours shall be first offered to regularly scheduled part-time  
Pharmacists based on seniority, before any outside agency is used.  
Additional hours shall be offered to the most senior Pharmacists on duty at the time the  
hours are needed, after the Hospital has exercised its option to offer the hours to part-time  
or casual employees. The senior Pharmacists shall have the night to refuse such  
additional hours. In that instance, they shall be offered by seniority and in the event no  
one wants them, the hours shall be assigned to the least senior qualified Pharmacist on  
6  
4.9  
4.6  
4.7.  
4.8  
duty. However, no one shall be required to work more than two (2) consecutive shifts  
not to exceed 19 hours without mutual consent except in emergency situations.  
Schedules shall be posted at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the  
Pharmacist’s scheduled work and that schedule shall reflect four (4) weeks of scheduled  
hours. Changes in posted schedules will not be made without notification and mutual  
consent to the Pharmacists affected. Changes to work assignments or work locations  
may be made without mutual consent so long as no work hours are changed.  
In the establishment of new work week schedules (including fewer weekends, fewer  
holiday shifts, opportunities for straight shifts, or changes in shift times of greater than 2  
hours) the Hospitals shall give preference to qualified employees in accordance with  
seniority.  
Changing Time: Each pharmacist who is required to change clothing on premises into  
hospital owned apparel has seven (7) minutes or other mutually agreed upon time with  
pay after the start of the shift to change and report to his or her work area and may leave  
his or her work area seven (7) minutes or other mutually agreed upon time with pay  
before the shift ends to change out of hospital owned apparel.  
Alternative Weekend Schedule: The Hospital may establish flexible scheduling plans  
providing work schedules of only two (2) 12-hour shifts every weekend. An employee  
may agree to work additional shifts; but such agreement shall not be a condition of being  
accepted for available Alternative Weekend Schedules. Plans established under this  
section 4.7 shall be subject to the following conditions:  
A. Alternative Weekend Schedules developed under this program shall be within a  
forty-eight (48) consecutive hours period between 7:00 p.m. on Friday and 7:00  
a.m. on the following Monday.  
B. An employee electing this program will be scheduled to work two (2) 12-hour  
shifts on consecutive days during the forty-eight (48) hour period on every  
weekend. The employee will receive thirty-six (36) hours of pay at the  
regular rate of pay for this twenty-four (24) hours of work.  
C. An employee working two (2) 12-hour weekend shifts on an Altemative  
Weekend Schedule shall be credited with thirty-six (36) hours per weekend  
[seventy-two (72) hours per payroll period] toward accumulation of all  
contractually provided benefits, including pension and seniority. An employee  
will receive one (1) hour of credit toward benefits for each additional hour the  
employee agrees to work.  
D. Vacation and sick leave used shall be paid and be deducted from the employee’ s  
accumulated vacation and sick leave at the same rate as it is accrued. An  
employee will, therefore, receive eighteen (18) hours of pay for each twelve (12)  
hour weekend shift taken as vacation or sick leave.  
4.9  
An employee electing an Alternative Weekend Schedule may be scheduled to  
work on each holiday falling on a weekend.  
Holiday pay shall be based on the number of hours regularly scheduled under the  
Alternative Weekend Program.  
Article 6 (Shift Differential, Weekend Bonus, and Lead Pay) relating to shift  
differentials, weekend bonus, and weekend premiums shall not apply to the two  
(2) 12- hour shifts for which an employee is normally scheduled; but will apply to  
any additional weekend shifts an employee agrees to work.  
The basic work week for employees on the Alternative Weekend Program shall  
be forty (40) hours per week. An employee shall be paid at rate of one and  
one-half (I 1/2) times his/her base regular rate for all hours worked in excess of  
forty (40) hours per week. An employee working in excess of her/his scheduled  
work day shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular  
base rate for all hours worked in excess of his/her scheduled shift, except that  
hours in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours in a work day shall be paid at the  
rate of double time.  
Employees on the Alternative Weekend Program may elect permanent assignment  
to the night shift. The remaining night shifts shall be shared proportionately by  
employees electing to work twelve (12) hour shifts on weekends under this  
Program.  
An employee may revoke her or his consent to an alternative weekend schedule  
pursuant to this program by giving written notice. The employee shall be entitled  
to return to an open available position for which the employee is qualified and  
which has an equal number of hours per payroll period as the employee had prior  
to electing the Alternative Weekend Program. The Hospital shall likewise give  
the employee notice of equal length in the event the Alternative Weekend  
Program was discontinued.  
An employee participating in this Alternative Weekend Program may, with  
Hospital approval, trade hours with an employee who is not on an Alternative  
Weekend Schedule. Each employee involved in the trade will be paid at that  
employee's regular rate of pay excluding the Altemative Weekend Schedule  
Premium and in accordance with that standard for overtime eligibility.  
An employee on an Altemative Weekend Schedule who trades hours with another  
employee who is scheduled to work a twelve (12) hour shift between 7:00 p.m. on  
Friday and 7:00 a.m. on the following Monday shall continue to receive pay as set  
forth in this Section. An employee who agrees to work a scheduled shift for an  
employee on an Alternative Weekend Schedule shall be paid at the rate of pay the  
employee would otherwise receive for weekend work.  
7-O n/7-O ff Schedules:  
The work schedule will consist of seven (7) consecutive shifts of work and seven  
(7) consecutive shifts when the employee will not be scheduled.  
Each shift will be ten (10) hours in length.  
The employee will work a total of seventy (70) hours in a two week pay period and  
will receive pay for eighty (80) hours (i.e., sixty (60) hours at straight time, ten  
(10) hours at time and one-half plus five (5) additional hours (WWP)).  
(1) In one of the payroll weeks of the employee’s schedule, he/she will work  
fifty (50) hours. Anything in excess of forty (40) hours will be paid at the  
overtime rate of one and one-half the employee’s hourly rate.  
(2) In the other payroll week of the employee’s schedule, he/she will work  
twenty (20) hours. If the department manager requests the employee to  
work any additional hours beyond the twenty (20) hours in the work week,  
the employee will be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half the  
employee’s hourly rate. (Assuming the employee worked his/her full  
schedule the previous week.)  
(3) If the employee voluntarily trades with another employee for additional  
hours during the twenty (20) hour week, he/she will be paid at his/her  
regular hourly rate. (Trading shifts is okay if it does not result in  
overtime.)  
(4) If the employee’s hours exceed forty (40) in either week, he/she will be  
eligible for overtime. Overtime will also be paid if the employee exceeds  
ten (10) hours of work in one day. Double time will be paid for hours  
exceeding twelve (12) in one day.  
Because of the favorable compensation benefit, vacation will not be earned or  
accrued once the employee is on this schedule. Vacation time that is accrued and  
unused at the time a pharmacist begins the 7-on and 7-off schedule will be frozen.  
While on this schedule, a pharmacist may only use frozen vacation time during  
approved unpaid leaves of absence. The unpaid leaves of absence for which  
frozen vacation time may be used does not include the seven uncompensated days  
off provided for in this Section. The pharmacist must request to use frozen  
vacation time during the leave of absence with the request for the leave. If a  
pharmacist discontinues the 7/70 schedule for any reason (e.g., moving to an 8/80  
position or separating employment), the frozen vacation time will be unfrozen.  
Eligible pharmacists upon reaching the five year step and above, will receive an  
annual bonus calculated at (FTE) x (rate of pay) x (40 hours). It shall be paid  
upon the request of the pharmacist. To be eligible for this benefit, pharmacists  
must be scheduled to work 7-on and 7-off and must be employed at Allina  
Hospitals and Clinics as a pharmacist for a minimum of 5 years.  
An eligible pharmacist upon reaching the 10 year step, will receive an annual  
bonus calculated at (FTE) x (rate of pay) x (80 hours) paid upon request. To be  
eligible for this benefit pharmacist must be scheduled to work 7-on and 7-off and  
must be employed at A llina Hospitals and Clinics as a pharmacist for a minimum  
of 10 years.  
Time off will have to have the approval of the department management. Up to  
seven (7) days of uncompensated time off per calendar year will be granted at a  
mutually agreed upon time between department management and the Pharmacist.  
The employee will not be asked to find his/her own replacement for these hours if  
a request is submitted for this unpaid leave of absence in accordance with the  
guidelines for requesting vacation and Section 8.5 of this A greement.  
A pharmacist may request days off in addition to the seven days described in the  
preceding paragraph. However, there is no guarantee that the request will be  
granted by the Hospital. Additionally, if an 8/80 employee requests the same time  
for vacation, the 8/80 employee will have preference.  
Pharmacists working this schedule will be required to work all holidays that will  
fall during their 7-on shifts.  
(1) If an employee works a ten (10) hour shift on a holiday, he/she will be paid  
ten (10) hours regular pay plus ten (10) hours of holiday pay. Any hours  
exceeding the ten (10) scheduled hours will be paid at the appropriate  
overtime rate.  
(2) An employee who does not work the holiday will have ten (10) hours of  
holiday pay added to his/her pay.  
(3) | During the thirty-two (32) hour Christmas and Thanksgiving holiday  
period, the Pharmacist will be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2)  
his/her base rate for all hours worked and will receive ten (10) hours of  
holiday pay for one (1) shift during the thirty-two (32) hour holiday period.  
Sick leave will be accrued at a rate of eight (8) hours for every 173.33 hours paid.  
If the employee is ill and misses a full ten (10) hour shift, he/she will be entitled to  
ten (10) hours of sick leave if he/she has accrued ten (10) hours.  
For each pay period that a full-time Pharmacist is on a medical leave of absence  
(MLOA), he/she will receive eighty (80) hours of pay when using seventy (70)  
hours of accrued sick leave.  
Long-term disability insurance will be offered as per the terms of the  
for full-time Pharmacists.  
Funeral leave will be granted and paid as per the A greement.  
Seniority will be based on the hours for which the employee is actually  
compensated, including sick leave. This means the employee will receive eighty  
10  
4.10  
0.1  
0.2  
9.3  
(80) hours of seniority even though he/she is only working seventy (70) hours  
(assuming the employee works his/her full schedule during the pay period).  
The employee will be classified as a regular full-time employee.  
In the event the Hospital desires to revoke this agreement and revert back to  
Article 4.1 of the Agreement, a minimum of ninety (90) days will be given to the  
Pharmacist to revert to an 8/80 position with scheduling per seniority.  
The Pharmacist will be given a copy of this work agreement for his/her files once  
the proper signatures are secured.  
For employees hired before January 1, 2001, the Pharmacist may elect to revoke  
the agreement one time. In the event the Pharmacist desires to revoke this  
agreement or no longer work this shift, the Pharmacist will notify the manager in  
writing. The Pharmacist will be given the first available open position which the  
pharmacist is qualified for and has seniority. Management may delay the transfer  
of the Pharmacist to an open position for up to ninety (90) days once an open  
position is available to allow time to fill the 7/70 position. If no position opens in  
one year and the Pharmacist has been in the 7/70 agreement for a minimum of five  
(5) years, the Pharmacist will go to an 8/80 position one year after written notice  
has been given. The Labor Management Committee (or a designated sub-  
committee) will address this situation per Article 5 (Labor Management  
Committee) of the Agreement, regarding developing desirable positions as part of  
a master schedule based on seniority.  
Per Diem: Pharmacists regularly scheduled less than 32 hours per pay period will be  
paid at the Per Diem rate indicated in Article 3 (Wages).  
A.  
Per Diem employees are not eligible for benefits or weekend bonuses. These  
employees are eligible for shift differentials, weekend premiums, holiday  
premium and overtime. Overtime will be defined using the 8 and 80 rule.  
Per Diem employees are required to work a minimum of two shifts per calendar  
month. If the minimum shift requirement is not met, then the per diem pharmacist  
will meet with management for further assessment prior to working additional  
shifts.  

### ARTICLE 5: LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE  
### 
A Labor Management Committee (“LMC”) shall be established consisting of equal  
representatives of labor and management to discuss matters affecting the parties other  
than formal grievances that may arise from time to time.  
The LMC may establish a sub-committee to review and discuss various scheduling  
issues.  
The LMC will meet monthly, unless cancelled by mutual consent; provided, however, the  
LMC will meet at least one time per calendar quarter.  
11  

### ARTICLE 6: SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL, WEEKEND BONUS, AND LEAD PAY  
### 
6.1 Shift Differential: A shift differential of two dollars and forty cents ($2.40) per hour  
Shall be paid for evening shifts. This shift differential shall be paid for the full shifts  
where the majority of the hours worked are between 3:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. A shift  
differential of four dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) per hour shall be paid for night shifts.  
This differential shall be paid for full shifts when a majority of the hours are worked  
between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.  
6.2. Weekend Bonus: Full-time and regularly scheduled part-time Pharmacists who work  
more weekend shifts than those for which they are regularly scheduled shall be paid an  
additional fifty dollars ($50.00) if the Pharmacist works four (4) hours or more. If the  
Pharmacist works less than four (4) hours, he/she shall receive twenty-five dollars  
($25.00). The provisions of this Section shall apply to all shifts worked between 3:00  
p.m. on Friday and 7:00 a.m. on the following Monday. The weekend bonus shall not be  
paid if additional shifts are worked as a result of Pharmacists voluntarily exchanging  
hours.  
6.3. Weekend Premium: All Pharmacists will receive one dollar and seventy-five cents  
($1.75) per hour as a weekend premium. This premium shall be paid for all hours where a  
majority of the hours are worked between 3:00 p.m. on Friday and 7:00 a.m. on the  
following Monday.  
6.4 Lead Pay: Pharmacists working in a lead role shall receive an additional two dollars and  
no cents per hour ($2.00).

accrual rate changes will be determined as of the anniversary date of employment. Continuous  
service periods will be measured from the last date of entrance into the service of the Hospital.  
8.2 Vacation Cash Out:  
One time per calendar year, a pharmacist may request a cash out of up to 40 hours of the  
following year’s vacation accrual. Cash out requests must be submitted and received by the  
Allina Human Resource Service Center by December 31 of each year for a pay out in the  
following year. The elected date of the pay out must be indicated on the pay out request form  
and this date must fall between A pril 1 and December 1 of the pay out year. Additionally, at the  
time of the pay out, the pharmacist must have accrued sufficient vacation hours to cover the cash  
Out.  
The following payment options are available:  
A. Lump Sum Cash Payment: An Employee may elect to receive all or a portion of  
the Vacation Cash Option in a single lump sum cash payment. An Employee  
must designate the number of hours to be distributed in this form at the time the  
Vacation Cash Option is elected. Such payment shall be paid as of the first  
payroll period on or after April 1 of the payment year. If an Employee fails to  
elect a payment option, the Employee will be deemed to have elected the Lump  
Sum Cash Payment option.  
B. Contribution to the Allina Pre-Tax Premium Payment Program: An Employee  
may elect to contribute all or a portion of the Vacation Cash Option to the  
Premium Payment Program in order to offset portion of the cost of  
Allina sponsored group medical coverage elected by the Employee. An  
Employee must designate the number of hours to be contributed to the Pre-Tax  
Premium Payment Program at the time the Vacation Cash Option is elected. Such  
contribution will then be distributed on a pro rata basis each payroll period to the  
extent such amount does not exceed the vacation accrued during the pay period.  
In the event insufficient vacation has accrued during the pay period, a Vacation  
Cash Option distribution will not be made and will be paid in a subsequent pay  
period in which sufficient vacation has accrued. This payment option will be  
administered in compliance with the provisions of Section 125 of the Internal  
Revenue Code and all applicable regulations.

8.4  
8.0  
C. Contribution to the Allina Flexible Benefit Program: An Employee may elect to  
have all or a portion of the Vacation Cash Option contributed to the Flexible  
Benefit Program. Such amount may be used to fund the amount the Employee  
elects to contribute to the Health Care Reimbursement Account and/or the  
Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. This payment option is a funding  
mechanism only. The Employee must also participate in the Flexible Benefit  
Program pursuant to the enrollment requirements applicable to that Program.  
Electing this payment option does not increase, decrease or replace the  
elections under the Flexible Benefit Program.  
An Employee must designate the number of hours to be contributed to the  
Account(s) under the Flexible Benefit Program at the time the Vacation Cash  
Option is elected. If an Employee elects to fund the Flexible Benefit Program  
with all or a portion of the Vacation Cash Option, such amount will be deposited  
in the Account(s) designated by the Employee as soon as administratively feasible  
following April 1. An employee’s remaining future contributions will be adjusted  
to account for this contribution. If the Vacation Cash Option distribution amount  
designated under this payment option exceeds the amount elected under the  
Flexible Benefit Program, such excess shall be paid in a single lump sum cash  
payment to the Employee. This option will be administered in compliance with  
the provisions of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code and all applicable  
regulations.  
D. Contribution to the Allina 403(b) Savings Plan: An Employee may elect to  
contribute all or a portion of the Vacation Cash Option to the 403(b) Savings  
Plan. An Employee must designate the number of hours to be contributed to the  
Savings Plan at the time the Vacation Cash Option is elected. If an Employee  
elects to contribute any portion of the Vacation Cash Option, such amount will be  
deposited as soon as administratively feasible following April 1 to the extent such  
amount is not an excess contribution (in which case such excess amount will be  
paid in a single lump sum cash payment to the Employee). This payment option  
will be administered in compliance with the provisions of Section 403(b) of the  
Internal Revenue Code and all applicable regulations.  
Hospitals presently providing vacation benefits in excess of those listed above shall  
continue such schedules for employees employed on the effective date of this A greement.  
Employees employed after said date shall receive vacation benefits as provided above.  
The maximum amount of accrued and unused vacation a pharmacist may carry at any  
time is 480 hours. When the pharmacist reaches the maximum amount of accrual, the  
pharmacist will not further accrue vacation hours until the balance falls below the  
maximum. Although vacation hours will not be lost once they are accrued, vacation will  
need to be used in order for additional vacation hours to be accrued. A pharmacist will  
not receive retroactive credit for time worked while his or her vacation balance is at the  
maximum accrual limit.  
If an employee becomes ill or disabled during vacation, she/he shall be paid sick pay,  
instead of vacation pay, upon certification by a competent physician or licensed health

February 15 for vacations scheduled between May 1 and September 30. Vacation  
requests shall be made by July 15 and the Hospital shall respond by August 15 for  
vacations scheduled between October 1 and A pril 30. Vacation requests submitted in this  
manner shall be awarded on a seniority basis. Vacation requests submitted after the dates  
specified will be awarded on a first come basis.  
Cancellations of approved vacation requests must be submitted at least six weeks prior to  
the start of a schedule (four weeks prior to the posting of the schedule) in order to allow  
other employees the opportunity to take vacation time. If a cancellation is not submitted  
with the six week notice, the employee is obligated to take the granted time off.  
Approved vacations may not be traded with other employees.  
If an employee cancels approved vacation time at least four weeks prior to the posting of  
the schedule in which vacation would occur, employees who previously bid on the time  
during the bid window will get preference to take the time off.  
Vacation is accrued each payroll period. Total accrued vacation eared during the  
payroll period and total accrued and unused vacation at the end of the payroll period are  
both computed and reported to the Pharmacist.

week period before or a four (4) week period after the holiday. An employee may, by  
mutual agreement with the Hospital, receive compensatory time off in lieu of holiday pay  
for time worked on a holiday.  
For purposes of this Article, Christmas Day shall be deemed to extend over a thirty-two  
(32) hour period from the start of the relief shift beginning on December 24 through the  
end of the relief shift which began on December 25. Thanksgiving Day shall be deemed

Pharmacists who have accrued the maximum sick leave of seven hundred and twenty  
(720) hours will have any additional sick leave hours earned converted to vacation at a  
ratio of twenty four (24) hours of sick time to eight (8) hours of vacation time. An  
automatic conversion will occur when 24 hours of sick leave has been earned above the

to employees in case of death in the family (spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law,  
brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, grandparents, grandchildren, and  
domestic partners and such others as may be agreed upon between the employee and the  
Hospital) for the purpose of making arrangements, attending the funeral, or mourning if  
attending the funeral is prohibitive. Such leave shall be the day of the funeral, the day  
prior thereto and the day after, unless different days are agreed upon between the

needed in addition to bereavement leave.  
The Hospital agrees to comply with Minnesota law regarding leaves for adoptive parents.  
Jury Duty: When an employee receives notice of jury duty, he/she shall notify his/her  
Supervisor at once. He/she will be given leave for such jury duty and will be made whole  
for loss of pay during that period. He/she will report for work whenever his/her jury duty  
does not conflict; provided, however he/she will not be required to work later than 7:00

or a presidential primary.  
14.8 School Conference and Activities Leave: Minnesota law allows an employee to take  
unpaid leave totaling up to 16 hours during any 12-month period to attend school  
conferences or school-related activities related to the child, provided the

When the leave cannot be scheduled during non-work hours and the need for the leave is  
foreseeable, the employee must provide reasonable prior notice of the leave and make a  
reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the  
employer.

the terms or provisions of this Agreement or arising out of disciplinary and discharge  
actions taken by the Employer shall be subject to the Grievance and Arbitration  
Procedure.  
20  
16.2  
On a case by case basis, the time limits outlined in this Article may be extended by  
written mutual agreement of the parties as entered into between a Union Steward or  
Union Representative and a Director of Human Resources or Allina’s Director of Labor  
Relations.  
Any decision to be made by the Employer that is not actually issued within the time  
limits set forth in this Article for Steps One or Two (Section 16.2.B or 16.2.C) will be  
deemed to have been issued as a denial of the grievance effective on the deadline date  
and will be subject to appeal accordingly.  
Only the Union or the Employer shall have the right to take a grievance to arbitration.  
Grievance and Arbitration Procedure:  
A.  
Pre-Grievance  
The employee and/or Union Steward will discuss the alleged grievance with the  
employee’s manager in an attempt to resolve the issue. The parties will jointly  
agree to a time frame for a response. This pre-grievance process will not extend  
the time limits for filing a grievance unless otherwise agreed pursuant to this  
Article.  
Step 1 - Written Grievance  
If the grievance is not resolved at Pre-Grievance, it must be submitted by a Union  
Steward or Union Representative, in writing, to Human Resources, with a copy  
provided by Human Resources to Allina Labor Relations. A written grievance  
shall include the Article and Section of the contract allegedly violated, the desired  
remedy or correction, and be signed and dated by a Union Steward and/or Union  
Representative.  
In no case shall there be any consideration given to a grievance unless such notice  
is put in writing and submitted within twenty (20) calendar days after the date of  
the occurrence giving rise to the grievance. A grievance relating to pay (wages,  
hours, vacations and days off, etc.) must be submitted in writing within thirty (30)  
calendar days after the payday for the period during which the grievance  
occurred. Failure to give such notice shall be a permanent waiver of the rights to  
pursue such grievance.  
Within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the grievance, representatives from  
the Employer and the Union and the grievant(s) will meet and attempt to resolve  
the grievance. Within five (5) business days (excluding weekends and holidays)  
after the date of the meeting, the Employer will issue a decision on the grievance  
to the Union Steward and or Union Representative and the grievant attending the  
meeting. A copy will be provided by Human Resources to Allina Labor  
Relations.  
Step 2 - Appeal Hearing  
21  
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, it must be submitted for an appeal  
hearing, in writing, to Allina Labor Relations, by the Union Representative and/or  
the Union Steward. The appeal must be submitted to the Director, Allina Labor  
Relations, within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the Step One decision.  
Within five business days from receipt of the appeal, representatives from the  
Employer and Union will agree to a date to meet to resolve the grievance.  
Within ten (10) business days after the date of the meeting, the Employer will  
issue a decision in writing on the grievance to the Union Representative and/or  
Union Steward attending the meeting.  
16.3. Arbitration and Mediation Procedure:  
In the event the grievance is not resolved, either the Union or the Employer shall have the  
right to appeal the grievance to Arbitration. All disputes referred to the Board shall be  
filed with the Director of Allina Labor Relations within thirty (30) calendar days after  
receipt of the Employer’s written decision.  
The time limits in this Section 16.3 may be extended by mutual agreement to enlist the  
services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services’ (FMCS). Any settlement  
reached as a result of the FMCS process is not final and binding unless mutually agreed  
to by the parties.  
The selection of the Arbitrator shall be made through a request to the Director of Federal  
Mediation and Conciliation Service for a panel of seven (7) neutral arbitrators. This list  
will be limited to Arbitrators with their primary office in Minnesota or Western  
Wisconsin. The parties shall select the Arbitrator by alternately deleting one name until  
six (6) names have been eliminated and the one person whose name remains shall be the  
elected Arbitrator; the parties shall flip a coin to determine who strikes first.  
By mutual agreement of the parties, the following alternative process for arbitration may  
be used:  
The matter shall be referred to a Board of Arbitration. This committee will consist of one  
(1) member selected by the Employer and one (1) member selected by the Union. In the  
event this arbitration committee cannot agree to a resolution of such dispute or grievance  
within five (5) working days after their first meeting the two (2) arbitrators shall select a  
third member, who shall serve as impartial chairperson. If said arbitrators are unable to  
agree upon the selection of an impartial chairperson within three (3) working days, then  
either arbitrator may request the Director of Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service  
to appoint a panel of seven (7) neutral arbitrators. The arbitrators shall alternately delete  
names and the last name shall be the impartial chairperson.  
The decision or award by the Arbitrators or a majority of them shall be final and binding.  
Neither the A rbitrator nor the Board of Arbitration shall have authority to add, subtract or  
modify the terms and provisions of this agreement. The Arbitrator and the Board of  
22  
16.4  
17.2  
Arbitration shall be confined to the issues raised in the written grievance and it shall have  
no power to decide any other issues.  
The decision or award by the Arbitrator or the Board of Arbitration shall be in writing  
and shall be final and binding. The expenses of the Arbitrator or the Board of Arbitration  
Shall be shared by the Employer and the Union equally.  
Deliberate Violations:  
In the event that the Employer deliberately violates the provisions of this Agreement  
relating to wages, hours of work, seniority rights, job classifications or titles, overtime  
differentials and vacations, any back pay owed to the employees because of such  
violation shall be paid by the Employer at the rate of two (2) times the standard straight-  
time rate or overtime rates. The Arbitrator or the Board of Arbitration shall calculate any  
cost violations and render the double penalty decision when it is definitely and  
conclusively shown that the violation was deliberate. Reasonable evidence of clerical  
errors or honest mistakes in interpretation shall exempt the Employer from the double  
penalty provisions. In such case the Employer will be required to pay only the actual  
amount of back pay involved. This paragraph shall be subject to the above provisions of  
this Article.  

### ARTICLE 17; INSURANCE  
### 
Health Insurance: Full time and part-time employees scheduled to work 32 hours or  
more per pay period may elect coverage under the hospital’s health insurance plans. The

### ARTICLE 18; SENIORITY  
### 
Definition: Seniority for full-time and part-time employees shall be based on the total  
number of compensated hours, excluding on-call hours, accumulated by an employee  
since the most recent date of hire. A seniority list shall be prepared and posted annually  
during January of each year.  
Training: Unless as otherwise stated in this Agreement, seniority will be an integral part  
of decision-making along with qualifications, experience, current pharmacist practice, and  
business need.  
Layoff: In reducing the number of Pharmacists, the Hospital shall first determine the  
number of full-time and part-time positions that will be needed. Pharmacists shall be laid  
off in reverse order of seniority, provided that more senior Pharmacists are willing to work  
the required shifts. Pharmacists will be recalled in reverse order of the lay-off. In the  
event of a layoff, the Hospital shall give notice of the intent to lay off to the Union with an  
explanation of the layoff. Upon request, representatives of the Hospital and the Union  
will meet to discuss the layoff.  
Job Openings: The Hospital will post a notice of any pharmacist position in a manner  
accessible to all employees for a period of five (5) work days. The notice shall specify the  
number of hours and shift. The most senior Pharmacist applying for the position shall be  
awarded the job in preference to less senior Pharmacists or outside Pharmacist applicants,  
if the employee is qualified to perform the duties of the open position. The Hospital shall  
25  
18.5  
make the initial decision as to qualifications, which may be subject to the grievance  
procedure if there is a disagreement.  
Low Need Days: In the event that the Employer determines a need to reduce the number  
of employees scheduled or the number of hours on a particular shift because of changes in  
staffing needs, the following procedure will be utilized:  
A.  
Voluntary absent days or reduced hours will be requested from employees on the  
affected shift in accordance with staffing patterns established for that shift by the  
Employer. Employees will be allowed to take voluntary absent days in order of  
seniority.  
If the needed reduction is not accomplished by (A) above, mandatory low need  
days will be assigned to least senior employee on the shift (day, evening, night)  
where the low need is necessary, so long as qualified personnel remain to perform  
the needed work. If the least senior employee has had 24 hours of mandatory low  
need time (for employees with 8 hour shifts) or 30 hours (for employees with 10  
hour shifts) during the calendar year, the low need will be assigned to the next  
least senior employee.  
If all the employees on the shift where the low need is necessary have reached the  
threshold in the previous paragraph, the least senior employee on the shift will  
receive the low need, so long as qualified personnel remain to perform the needed  
work.  
Casual, per diem, and temporary pharmacists (residents not included) will be low  
needed first, so long as qualified personnel remain to perform the needed work.  
Pharmacy residents will not be used to back-fill shifts for which a regularly  
scheduled pharmacist has been assigned a mandatory low need day.  
A pharmacist who is assigned a mandatory low need day will be given at least 90  
minutes’ notice before the beginning of the low need time.  
Employees will have the choice to use vacation or take a benefit/no-pay day.  
18.6 Reduction of Hours: Hours of part-time Pharmacists shall not be reduced because of  
the hiring of additional part-time Pharmacists, so long as the remaining part-time staff is  
willing to work the required shifts.

### ARTICLE 31; LEAVES OF ABSENCE FOR UNION BUSINESS  
### 
Management will work with the union to provide opportunity for Pharmacists to  
participate in union activities by permitting unpaid leaves of absence for union business.  
If the request for a union leave of absence is submitted prior to the normal schedule  
requesting period, the request will be granted so long as the Hospital does not incur  
overtime to fill the missed shifts. However, vacation requests will take precedence over a  
union leave of absence.  
If the union leave of absence is submitted after the normal schedule requesting period the  
pharmacist must find his/her own replacement. The Hospital will help facilitate the  
pharmacist finding his/her own replacement by sending an email to solicit volunteers.  
Final approval will only be granted after all the shifts are filled without overtime incurred  
by the Hospital.  
Employees may choose to use vacation time on an unpaid union leave of absence.
