The above jurisdictional claims are intended only to apply to the recognized craft  \njurisdiction of the General Laborers\u2019 Union. The fact that certain classifications and rates are  \nestablished does not mean that the Employer must employ workmen for any one or all such  \nclassifications, or to man any particular piece of plant or vehicle that happens to be on the work,  \nunless, in the opinion of the Employer, there is need for such a workman. Nothing in this  \nAgreement shali be construed to define or determine any craft or work jurisdiction or the  \nrecognition thereof by the Employer.  \nsection 6. (A) This Agreement covers the Employer's asphait plants, the Employer's  \noperations on the job site and the Employer's operations of a temporary nature in specific  \nsupport of the job site project, not to include permanent facilities nor the Employer's home office  \nfacilittes of whatever nature, and shail not include professional engineers, engineering or clerical  \nemployees, guards, watchmen, timekeepers, parts men, superintendents, assistant  \nsuperintendents, general foremen, or any supervisors in charge of any class of labor.

The Employers, recognizing that the Unions operate and maintain the only  \ncentralized sources of skilled manpower available to the construction industry within the State of  \nMissouri and that the Unions, in order to properly represent the workmen must be notified of all  \nmanpower needs of, and employment opportunities with the Employers both before the job  \nbegins and throughout its progress, agree as follows:  \nA.  \nBefore starting work on any job of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or over, the  \nEmployer shall invite representatives of the Union involved to a pre-job conference  \non the job site or at some other mutually agreed upon place. The names of all  \nsubcontractors shall be furnished to the Union at such conference if known by the  \ncontractor at that time; and in any event the names of such subcontractors shall be  \nfurnished to the Union before said subcontractors shall commence work. The  \nEmployer will then outline his initial and prospective manpower requirements in all  \nthe various crafts and classifications, and the Union will inform the Employer of the  \nprobable number and qualifications of the men they will have available to meet the  \nEmployer's requirements. The Employer shall notify the Union having jurisdiction  \nprior to commencing work on projects of less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)  \nof manpower requirements and subcontractors who will be on the project.  \nsubject only to the rights of the Contractor to employ and transfer men under Section  \n2 of this Article, the Employer shall not employ workmen, either to start a new job or  \nto replace a workman or fill a new position of a job in progress without first calling the  \nappropriate Union office or representative and requesting a referral of applicants for  \nthe job or jobs available. The Employer shall not request the referral of more men  \nthan the number of available jobs. If he does so, those men referred but not  \nemployed shall be reimbursed in the amount of two (2) hours\u2019 pay for the job they  \nwere referred to do. The Union shall fill the Employer's request for men qualified to  \nperform the work involved as soon as possible.  \n. If the Union fails for any reason to refer applicants within twenty-four (24) hours, the  \nEmployer may secure such workmen from any source available to him.  \nD. The Employer shail have the right to accept or reject for good and just cause any job  \napplicant and to select from among applicants those who are, in his estimation, the  \nbest qualified. In case of reduction of forces, the Employer shall have the right to  \nselect those best qualified in his opinion, to be retained, as long as there is no  \ndiscrimination against workmen from the area of the Local Union that has jurisdiction  \nof the job.  \nE. In any emergency situation, men may be secured on a temporary basis in any  \nmanner to perform any kind of work for as long as, but no longer than the emergency  \nexists, but in no case more than twenty-four (24) hours.  \nSection 2. The Unions, recognizing that the success and efficiency of every contractor  \norganization in the construction industry depends in large measure on the availability to them of  \ncertain men who are skilled in the various crafts and classifications, and who have known  \nabilities to work in harmony and help organize an efficient crew, agree as follows:  \nWithout regard for any of the limitations imposed by the preceding Section 1 of this  \nthe first (ist) and third (3rd) laborer employed by the Employer on the job shall be from  \nthe Local Union having jurisdiction on the job. The second (2nd) laborer employed and fifty  \npercent (50%) of the remaining work force may be brought by the Employer to the job from any  \nplace or Union jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Unions agree to give due consideration to any  \nEmployer's request for the first workman or additional laborers consistent with the purpose of  \nthis Section. Laborers outside the Local Union furnished by the Employer shall be required to  \nregister with the Local Union Office prior to employment on the job site. Working foremen who  \nare part of the bargaining unit will be employed in the order, and counted as part of the total  \nwork force, as aforementioned. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section, there shalf be no  \nrestriction on the transfer of men within the jurisdictional area of the Local Union.  \nSection 3. Should any Contractor fail to hold a pre-job conference or refuse to request  \nreferrals of men as provided hereinabove, then the Union shall have the right to strike to enforce  \ncompliance therewith, any contrary provision in this Agreement notwithstanding. However, no  \nstrike shall be called unless authorized by a decision of the appropriate District Council or  \nauthorized representatives of the Council and after at least a forty-eight (48) hour notice  \nexcluding Saturday and Sunday of intention fo strike given by the District Council to both the  \nEmployer's main office and the office of the Associated General Contractors of Missouri in  \nJefferson City, MO.  \nSection 4. Should any Employer refuse to employ an applicant referred by the Union  \nunder the above provisions and such refusal is not for a good and just cause, then the Union  \nmay ask for arbitration. If so, the same arbitration procedure shall be followed as is set out in  \nArticle XIl of this Agreement. If the Unions win such arbitration, the applicant refused  \nemployment shall be made whole by the Employer for all losses suffered and shall be put to  \nwork on the job if the job he was referred to still exists.  \nSection 5. In order that the Employer may be properly advised of the persons and/or  \noffices to be notified by the Employer desiring to arrange pre-job conferences or to request a  \nreferral of applicants, the Union will promptly furnish to the office of the Associated General  \nContractors of Missouri in Jefferson City a list of such persons and offices showing the territorial  \njurisdiction of each, office telephone numbers, and home telephone numbers of the Union  \nagents involved. The Union will keep these lists revised as necessary.  \n"], ["ARTICLE iV  \nUnion Security  \n", "Section 1.

Should any unforeseen  \nemergency arise at a time when workmen are not available at the job site, work may be  \nperformed by any employee until workmen are secured.  \nSection 3. The Employer shail furnish clean, fresh drinking water and ice daily on all  \njobs during the summer months and when conditions warrant same, and shall furnish sanitary  \npaper drinking cups, and water, as the first order of business after starting time.
