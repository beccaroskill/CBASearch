case the Union shall refer the first applicant on the list who possesses such special  
skills and abilities. When a laborer cannot qualify for the specific work needed, he shall  
be paid for the time worked only. The Employer shall confirm such request in writing to

applicants directly, subject to the Union's Security Clause, in Article 4. In such event, the  
Employer shall notify the Union Office of the names of the persons employed and the  
dates of the hirings; such notice shall be given within twenty-four (24) hours of the

refers.

request. Emergency referrals made outside the designated dispatch hours would also  
be made in order, however, applicants who are unavailable or refuse such referrals will  
not be penalized.

certain regions. Once an applicant has thus classified him or herself, all penalties

will be operating with multiple, regional referral lists.  
In the event that the Union, trying to fill an Employer's request, has exhausted all  
possible applicants for referral from that region's list and still requires more workers, the  
office may move on to the next, closest list. However, applicants who refuse such  
referrals or are unavailable under these circumstances will not be penalized.  
All members are required to sign the out of work list according to the county in which  
they seek employment. The name of the registrant so dispatched shall be stricken from  
the list if the job to which the registrant is dispatched lasts long enough for the  
dispatched registrant to receive three (3) days' pay at straight time if employed.

removed from the out of work list if the applicant takes any action within the first three

voluntarily quitting or requesting to be laid off or discharged from a job to which he or  
she is referred.

discriminatory administration of the referral process as contained in this Article. The

claims and demands, suits, actions, administrative proceedings, recoveries, judgments,  
costs and expenses or other liabilities in any manner arising out of or in connection with

specified herein.  
Section 2. It is understood and agreed that any employee covered by an Employer  
under the terms of this Agreement may continue in the employment of that Employer at  
any location or on any project within the jurisdiction of the referring Local Union without  
going through the hiring procedure again so long as his employment is continuous,

employee.  
Section 3. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that upon  
sixty (60) days written notice sent by registered mail, given by one of the parties to the
