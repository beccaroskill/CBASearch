the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent under Section 9(a) of the National  
Labor Relations Act for all employees within the bargaining unit on all present  
and future job sites within the jurisdiction of the Union, unless and until such time

status ‘among its employees in the bargaining unit described herein, it will  
voluntarily recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all  
employees within the bargaining unit on all present and future job sites within the  
jurisdiction of the Union. The Employer expressly waives any right it has to  
condition its recognition of the Union upon the Union’s certification by the NLRB  
as the employees’ bargaining representative following the NLRB election.

effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing by the  
payment of their regular monthly dues as a condition of continued employment.

indemnify, defend and hold the Employer harmless from any claim arising from  
any such discharge. |

The parties hereby incorporate by reference, as part of this agreement, the  
“Apprenticeship Standards For Construction Craft Laborer” adopted by the parties  
on January 26, 1998.  
Employers employing one or more apprentice(s) shall participate in the  
4000 hour Massachusetts Laborers District Council Apprentice Program under the  
above-referenced standards for construction craft laborer.  
A.  
New applicants for membership who cannot provide reasonable proof of  
4,000 or more hours of employment as a Construction Craft Laborer (or,  
alternatively, cannot demonstrate equivalent skills in a placement  
examination administered by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training  
Committee (JATC) shall, whenever, possible, enter the Apprenticeship  
program. Any person entering but failing to maintain and complete his or  
her Apprenticeship shall not be employed by the Employer as a Journey  
Worker under this Agreement. The failure of any Apprentice to maintain  
his or her Apprenticeship status shall obligate the Employer to discharge  
such person upon notice from the Union.  
The Apprenticeship and Training Standards approved by the USS.  
Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, and the  
Massachusetts Department of Labor and Training are hereby incorporated  
by reference as a part of this Agreement.  
43  
The Apprentice wage rates:  
Hours of Credit Wage Rate  
0 — 999 60% of Journey Worker  
1,000 — 1,999 70% of Journey Worker  
2,000 — 2,999 80% of Journey Worker  
3,000 — 3,999 90% of Journey Worker  
4,000 — over Journey Worker  
The Employer may pay a higher rate at its option. However, the Apprentice  
must meet his or her commitments to the Joint Apprenticeship Committee  
regardless of the level being paid.  
The Employer shall pay an Apprentice the full fringe benefit package as  
described in this contract.  
Entry into the Apprenticeship Program shall be controlled by the JATC,  
which shall employ appropriate testing and screening procedures. An  
Apprentice advances from one hours-of-credit and wage-rate category to  
another only upon determination of satisfactory performance by the JATC,  
which shall have the authority to grant accelerated credit where warranted  
by the performance of an individual apprentice.  
The Employer shall participate in the Apprenticeship Program by accepting  
apprentices for employment upon referral by the Union. The employer is  
not obligated to accept more than one (1) Apprentice for every five (5)  
Journey Workers commencing with the sixth laborer employed.  
The Employer may not employ an Apprentice until at least one Journey  
Worker is employed and thereafter may not employ more than one (1)  
Apprentice for every additional three (3) Journey Workers.  
An Apprentice should, whenever possible, be rotated by the Employer  
through different types of work so as to become trained in a variety of  
operations and work skills. Where the Employer is unable to provide an  
Apprentice with experience in the full range of craft skills, the JATC may  
request the Local Union to reassign the Apprentice to other employment in  
order to provide that experience. For so long as the Employer is able to  
provide the necessary range of employment experience, the Employer may  
44  
   
   
   
choose to retain the apprentice from job to job but shall notify the Local  
Union and JATC of all reassignments.  
An Apprentice shall not work on the jobsite unless supervised by a Journey  
Worker. 7  
An Apprentice shall not be penalized for taking off from work to attend  
offsite training (though time off for training is unpaid).  
It is the intent of the parties that this provision will not result in the  
displacement of Journey Workers.  
These provisions calling for the hiring of apprentices are not applicable to  
instances where the employer is recalling to employment employees who  
have worked for that company in the past year and these provisions apply  
only when the employer is hiring new employees.  
The Employer, whenever possible, may contact the apprentice program well  
in advance of hiring apprentices and arrange with the apprentice program  
for the training of apprentices to meet that employer’s specific contemplated  
needs.  
All disputes arising under this provision shall for the duration of this  
contract be referred to a special designated grievance committee consisting  
of one designee from the Massachusetts Laborers’ District Council and one  
designee from the Employer’s Association.

### MARKET RECOVERY AND RETENTION COMMITTEE  
### 
   
It is hereby understood and agreed by and between the Union and the  
Associations that, for the term of the collective bargaining agreement commencing  
June 1, 2004 and expiring by its terms on May 31, 2008, there shall be established  
a Market Recovery Committee, consisting of four (4) members, one member shall  
be the Business Manager for the District Council, or his designee, who shall be the  
Chairman of the Committee; one shall be the Business Manager of the Local  
47  
Union in whose jurisdiction the particular job or project is located; one shall be  
the Association representing the employer; and one shall be the signatory  
employer involved in the particular job or project. The purpose and authority of  
the Market Recovery Committee shall be to consider and, where appropriate, grant  
requests for modifications on a job by job basis from negotiated contractual  
conditions as provided for by this Article.  
In recognition of the current downturn in the construction industry within  
Massachusetts, the parties hereto have agreed to consider appropriate action to  
place signatory contractors in a better competitive position in the marketplace.  
Accordingly, for any job bid from and after June 1, 2004, and during the term of  
this Agreement, a signatory contractor may request and the Market Recovery and  
Retention Committee by majority vote may grant, any and all of the following  
modifications of contractual conditions where warranted by competitive  
conditions:  
1. A carry over on the hourly wage rate in effect at the time the job is bid for  
the duration of the job or for one (1) year beyond the contractual expiration of that  
rate, whichever may occur first; in that event upon expiration of the bid rate,  
employees shall receive the contractual wage rate then in effect;  
2. A special wage rate of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the basic  
wage rate for alteration, repair, renovation, remodeling work, maintenance  
projects, and new construction work of any kind not subject to federal, state, city  
or town predetermined wage and fringe benefit rates;  
3. A condition that allows the contractor to retain a non-signatory specialty  
subcontractor on jobs below $100,000 provided the Employer notifies the Council  
prior to its bid that it is unable to locate a suitable, signatory subcontractor; to  
request this condition, the Employer must notify the Council reasonably in  
advance of the submission of bids for the job;  
4. A condition that allows the contractor to schedule four (4) ten (10) hour  
days on a Monday-Friday basis at straight-time;  
5. A condition that allows a Saturday make-up day at straight-time in the  
event time is lost during the regular work week due to inclement weather,  
provided the entire laborer crew and associated trades are sent home on that day.  
Any time worked in such week beyond forty (40) hours must be paid at the  
overtime rate; make-up time for Saturday shall be at least eight (8) hours in  
48  
   
   
   
   
duration and shall not be mandatory. If any other associated trades on the job  
receive premium pay for the Saturday, then laborers shall receive premium pay.  
6. It 1s understood that there may be instances when suitable, competitive  
union subcontractors may not be available for certain subcontracts. In such  
instances, the Employer may request of the Union, in a timely manner prior to bid  
or the award, that the Union endeavor to locate suitable, competitive union  
subcontractors to bid for the work. If the Employer and the Union are unable to  
locate such suitable, competitive subcontractors, in accordance with a good faith  
effort pursuant to the above procedure, it is understood and agreed that the  
Employer shall be relieved of the subcontracting clause [Article II, section 7] for  
such subcontractors; provided however, that the subcontractor selected by the  
Employer must be a responsible contractor who provides workers’ compensation  
insurance for all laborers on the project and does not misclassify any employees as  
“mdependent contractors.” This section shall not apply on any project within  
Zone | or covered by a Project Labor Agreement (PLA).  
7. It is also understood that there may be instances where, in order to be  
competitive, an Employer may request that the “fair percentage” provisions of this  
Agreement [Article II, Section 6(b)] not be applied. In. such instances, the  
Employer may make such a request to the Local Union having territorial  
jurisdiction, in a timely manner prior to bid. For the fair percentage clause to be  
waived on a project all laborer employees must have been employed by the  
employer a minimum of three (3) weeks in the previous five (5) months. This  
section shall not apply to any project covered under a PLA.  
8. Any disputes under Section 6 and 7 above as to whether a union  
subcontractor is suitable, competitive, whether the Employer notified the Union in  
a timely manner, or whether a non-union subcontractor is responsible and  
complies with the standards set forth in this section, or a fair percentage should be  
applied on a project are to be exclusively resolved by a four person committee  
convened under the first paragraph of this Article The chairman shall convene the  
committee within forty-eight (48) hours and a decision shall be reached that day.  
Any decisions of the panel shall be by majority vote and shall apply to only that  
particular job which was considered by committee and shall be final, binding and  
conclusive on all parties signatory to this Agreement and the Local Union  
involved in the job.
