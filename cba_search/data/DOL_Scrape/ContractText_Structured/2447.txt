2017-2021 BASIC AGREEMENT  
This Agreement, effective December 1, 2016, is between the  
30 Major League Clubs and the Major League Baseball Players  
Association (hereinafter referred to as the “Players Association” or  
the “Association’).  
In making this Agreement the Association represents that it contracts  
for and on behalf of the Major League Baseball Players and individu-  
als who may become Major League Baseball Players during the term  
of this Agreement, and the Clubs represent that they contract for and  
on behalf of themselves, any additional Clubs which may become  
members of the Major Leagues and the successors thereof.  
ARTICLE I—lIntent and Purpose  
The intent and purpose of the Clubs and the Association (hereinafter  
“the Parties”) in entering into this Agreement is to set forth their agree-  
ment on certain terms and conditions of employment of all Major  
League Baseball Players for the duration of this Agreement. Each of  
the Parties acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of the other  
Party and agrees to discharge its responsibilities under this Agreement.  

### ARTICLE  
### 
The Clubs recognize the Association as the sole and exclusive collec-  
tive bargaining agent for all Major League Players, and individuals  
who may become Major League Players during the term of this Agree-  
ment, with regard to all terms and conditions of employment, provided  
that an individual Player shall be entitled to negotiate in accordance  
with the provisions set forth in this Agreement (1) an individual salary  
over and above the minimum requirements established by this Agree-  
ment and (2) Special Covenants to be included in an individual Uni-  
form Player’s Contract, which actually or potentially provide  
additional benefits to the Player.  
ARTICLE UI—Uniform Player’s Contract  
The form of the Uniform Player’s Contract between a Club and a  
Player is attached hereto as Appendix A, which is incorporated herein  
by reference and made a part hereof.  
During the term of this Agreement, no other form of Uniform Player’s  
Contract will be utilized. Should the provisions of any Contract  
between any individual Player and any of the Clubs be inconsistent  
with the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement  
shall govern. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article IV below,  
nothing herein contained shall limit the right of any Club and Player to  
enter into Special Covenants in the space provided in a manner not  
inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. The termination of  
this Agreement shall not impair, limit or terminate the rights and duties  
of any Club or Player under any Contract between any individual  
Player and any of the Clubs.  
ARTICLE IV—Negotiation and Approval of Contracts  
A Player, if he so desires, may designate an agent to conduct on  
his behalf, or to assist him in, the negotiation of an individual salary  
and/or Special Covenants to be included in his Uniform Player’s Con-  
tract with any Club, provided such agent has been certified to the  
Clubs by the Association as authorized to act as a Player Agent for  
such purposes.  
The Association shall provide the Office of the Commissioner with a  
comprehensive list of the certified Player Agent(s) whom each Player  
has designated to act on his behalf for the purposes described in this  
Article IV. The Association also shall provide the Office of the Com-  
missioner with any changes to such Player Agent designations, includ-  
ing the Player Agent designations of Players who have been added to  
a Major League roster, on a weekly basis. In addition, the Association  
will provide the Office of the Commissioner with notice of any revi-  
sions to its regulations governing Player Agents, and a complete copy  
of the revised regulations.  
If the Association has notified the Office of the Commissioner that a  
Player has designated a certified Player Agent or Agents to act on his  
behalf for the purposes described in this Article IV, no Club may nego-  
tiate or attempt to negotiate an individual salary and/or Special  
Covenants to be included in a Uniform Player’s Contract with any  
Player Agent(s) other than such Player Agent(s). No agent designation  
shall be considered effective unless it was transmitted from the Asso-  
ciation to the Office of the Commissioner.  
A Club may require a Player’s physical presence only once during con-  
tract negotiations. This limitation shall not apply to telephone confer-  
ence calls, at reasonable times, with a Player and his certified Player  
Agent. A Player required to be physically present during negotiations  
during the offseason shall be entitled to be paid by the Club for round-  
trip first-class transportation and first-class hotel costs, and a daily  
meal and tip allowance, at the same rate as the in-season meal and tip  
allowance provided under Article VII(B) for the immediately preced-  
ing season, for that day and any additional travel days.  
Upon execution of a Uniform Player’s Contract by the Club and  
Player, the Club promptly shall submit the Contract, in duplicate, to  
the Commissioner for approval. Within 20 days of receipt, the Com-  
missioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract (with notice to the  
Association), or provide the Association with a written explanation of  
why the Contract has not been approved. This period is extended to  
30 days if a Contract is received by the Commissioner between Feb-  
ruary 15 and April 15. Within ten days after the Commissioner is to  
provide an explanation of why a Contract has not been approved, the  
Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the Contract. (See Attach-  
ment 1.) Any Grievance challenging the Commissioner’s conduct  
under this Article shall be handled by the Parties on an expedited basis  
with documents being exchanged within 10 days of the filing of the  
Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of the filing of the  
Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with an opinion to follow,  
if necessary) no later than 15 days following the commencement of  
the hearing.  
The Office of the Commissioner will provide copies of all newly  
signed and approved Uniform Player’s Contracts as frequently as is  
feasible, but no less frequently than on a monthly basis. Contracts not  
yet approved or disapproved by the Commissioner will be made avail-  
able to the Association upon its request.  
ARTICLE V—Scheduling  
A. Length of Season  
During the term of this Agreement, each Club shall be scheduled to  
play 162 games during each championship season. The 2017 champion-  
ship season will not be scheduled over a period of less than 178 days  
or more than 183 days. Beginning in 2018, each championship season  
will not be scheduled over a period of less than 182 days or more than  
187 days. If, however, any Club’s championship season is scheduled to  
open with a game played outside of the United States and Canada, and  
the scheduling of such a game causes the championship season for  
those Clubs to be scheduled over a period of more than 183 days or  
187 days beginning in 2018 (an “International Opener’), then the  
championship season for all other Clubs shall commence on the date  
of the first regularly scheduled championship season game within the  
183 days (or 187 days beginning in 2018) preceding the regularly  
scheduled end of the championship season. See Article VI(C).  
Following completion of each championship season, ten Clubs shall  
qualify for Post-Season play: the three Division Champions in each  
League and the two other Clubs in each League with the highest per-  
centage of wins in the championship season (Wild Card Clubs). In  
each League, the two Wild Card Clubs shall play a single elimination  
game. Thereafter, the three Division Champions in each League and  
the winner of the Wild Card Game in that League shall engage in a best  
of five (seven if the Division Series is expanded) Division Series. See  
Attachment 25. The winners of the Division Series in each League  
shall then engage in a best of seven League Championship Series, and  
the winners of the two League Championship Series shall engage in a  
best of seven World Series. If during the term of this Agreement the  
format of the Wild Card Games, the Division Series, the League  
Championship Series or the World Series is proposed to be changed,  
the Clubs shall give the Association notice thereof and shall negotiate  
the proposed change with the Association; provided, however, that if  
during the term of this Agreement the Division Series is proposed to be  
changed to the best of seven games, the Clubs shall give the Associa-  
tion notice thereof and shall negotiate with the Association but the  
Clubs shall not be required to negotiate with the Association over con-  
tributions to the Players’ pool beyond those specified in Article X. Any  
failure to play the Wild Card Games, the Division Series, the League  
Championship Series or the World Series, in whole or in part, by rea-  
son of causes beyond the control of the Clubs, shall not constitute a  
change in the format of such Series or a breach of this Agreement.  
During any negotiations between the Parties on the subject of a  
renewal of or successor to this Agreement, the Clubs agree that any  
proposal made by the Association to reduce the number of champion-  
ship season games shall not be resisted on the ground of commitments  
made by the Clubs in local television and radio contracts. However,  
nothing herein shall interfere with or limit the right of the Clubs to  
resist such proposal on any other ground or the right of either Party to  
take any other position in future negotiations on this or any other  
proper subject for collective bargaining.  
B. Championship Schedules  
On or before July | of each year, copies of the tentative championship  
schedules of the Major Leagues for the next ensuing season shall be  
submitted to the Association for review. The Office of the Commis-  
sioner will use best efforts to include times of games. The Association  
shall complete its review not later than September 1. Thereafter, the  
Office of the Commissioner will promptly notify the Association of  
proposed changes in the tentative championship schedules submitted  
to the Association above.  
C. Additional Scheduling Agreements  
(1) Split doubleheaders may be included in the original schedule  
pursuant to Section C(14) below. Provided that neither of the Clubs  
involved in the proposed rescheduled game has already played or  
has been rescheduled to play a total of three split doubleheaders  
(exclusive of any splits in the original schedule) in that champion-  
ship season:  
(a) each Club shall have the right to reschedule any postponed  
game as a split doubleheader when ticket sales for the game at the  
time of postponement exceed, in any respect, the number of com-  
parable tickets available to be exchanged by the Club for the bal-  
ance of the championship season, and both the postponed and  
rescheduled game occur in the last regularly scheduled series  
between the two Clubs at the Club’s park; and  
(b) when there is no practical alternative to doing so, the  
Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs shall have the right to  
reschedule a postponed game as a split doubleheader to be played  
in, respectively, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, even if the cri-  
teria set out in subparagraph (a) above are not met. Scheduling a  
postponed game as part of a conventional doubleheader will not  
be considered a practical alternative.  
The Association shall have the exclusive right to approve the addi-  
tional rescheduling of postponed games as split doubleheaders in  
circumstances that are not automatically permitted by subparagraph  
(a) or (b) above. If the Association agrees to a split doubleheader  
pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be scheduled for the  
visiting Club’s next visit to the home Club’s park absent good  
cause and agreement between the Office of the Commissioner and  
the Association.  
(2) One-day stands will not be scheduled except as doubleheaders  
(to be followed by an open day) or as “openers,” provided that any  
game played on the day following the opener does not start before  
4 P.M. A game will not be rescheduled as a one-game stand except  
as required to complete the championship schedule.  
(3) During the championship season, no Club shall be scheduled  
to play an exhibition game. For purposes of this paragraph (3), a  
Spring Training or pre-season exhibition game that is scheduled to  
commence at least three hours before the start of the first champion-  
ship season game shall not be considered played “during the  
championship season.”  
(4) There shall be one off-day with no workouts scheduled either  
after a Club breaks Spring Training camp and before the final pre-  
season exhibition game, or between the last Spring Training or pre-  
season exhibition game and the first championship season game.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this off-day may be scheduled the  
day after the Club opens the championship season if the Club is  
selected to play on the first day of the championship season and the  
first day of the championship season has five or fewer games. If the  
off-day occurs after the start of the championship season, the Club  
may hold a voluntary workout or travel on the off-day. If the off-day  
occurs prior to the start of the championship season, a Club may not  
hold a workout, voluntary or otherwise.  
(5) The following shall apply to the scheduling or rescheduling  
of games prior to day doubleheaders:  
(a) a game will not be scheduled to start after 5 P.M. if either  
Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day; and  
6  
(b) a game will not be rescheduled to start after 5 P.M. if  
either Club is scheduled to play a day doubleheader the next day  
unless such rescheduling is necessary to complete the champion-  
ship schedule.  
(6) Day games shall not be scheduled or (unless necessary to  
complete the championship schedule) rescheduled to start before  
1 P.M., except as provided in paragraph (7) below, and except that  
such games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between  
Noon and | P.M., if each Club meets one of the following two  
conditions:  
(a) if an off-day occurred the previous day; or  
(b) if a game were played in the same city within the previous  
24 hours.  
Day games may be scheduled or rescheduled to start between Noon  
and | P.M. on holidays if each Club meets one of the above con-  
ditions or if an afternoon game starting not later than 5 P.M. ora  
doubleheader starting not later than 1:30 P.M. was played in  
another city the previous day and the in-flight time required is 1'/2  
hours or less.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, day games may start at Noon on the  
Opening Day of the championship season.  
(7) With the approval of the Commissioner, not more than 4  
games per League per year may be scheduled or rescheduled to start  
between 10:30 A.M. and Noon, if, with respect to both Clubs, the  
conditions stated in paragraph (6) above with respect to scheduling  
and rescheduling of day games between Noon and | P.M. are met.  
(8) For the 2017 championship season, a Club may not be sched-  
uled to play a road game starting after 5 P.M. if such game is fol-  
lowed by a home off-day, except under the following circumstances:  
(a) the in-flight time between Major League cities for the  
Club traveling home to an off-day is two hours or less;  
(b) the in-flight time for the visiting Club traveling home to an  
off-day is more than 2 hours and less than or equal to 2 hours and  
10 minutes in length, and the travel does not require any West-to-  
East change in time zones;  
(c) the game is scheduled pursuant to a national television  
agreement; or  
(d) the visiting Club is playing the Texas Rangers in Arlington,  
Texas on or after June 1.  
For the 2018 championship season, the latest possible start time  
for getaway games on days when the visiting Club travels to a home  
off-day or either Club travels to another game the following day shall  
be determined by taking the portion of the in-flight time that exceeds  
2'/2 hours, and subtracting that amount of time from 7 P.M. However,  
the foregoing sentence shall not apply to getaway games that are  
broadcast on ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball’; getaway games  
played in Arlington, Texas after June 1 (unless the Texas Rangers  
move to a climate-controlled home ballpark), or rescheduled games.  
Additionally, each Club that is limited by its stadium lease agree-  
ment or governmental regulation in the number of day games it may  
play shall receive one exception annually to the rules set forth in this  
Article V(C)(8), provided that the Club has applied for and has been  
denied a waiver by its lessor or the relevant governmental authority.  
For each subsequent season covered by this Agreement, unless  
the Parties agree otherwise, the Association will notify the Commis-  
sioner’s Office in writing on or before September | in the year prior  
to the season whether it elects to (a) continue the terms in place for  
the 2018 season set forth above; or (b) revert back to the terms in  
place for the 2017 season set forth above.  
All references to “in-flight time” in this Article V shall be as set  
forth in Appendix C.  
(9) For the 2017 championship season, getaway games shall not  
be scheduled or rescheduled to start later than 5 P.M. if either Club  
is required to travel for a day game the following day between cities  
for which the in-flight time is more than 1!/2 hours. Each champion-  
ship season schedule may contain six exceptions to the rule in the  
immediately preceding sentence provided that the traveling Club is  
traveling to Chicago to play the Cubs and the in-flight time does not  
exceed 2!/2 hours.  
Beginning with the 2018 championship season, no Club shall be  
scheduled or rescheduled to start a game prior to 5 P.M. when one  
of the Clubs played a game the prior evening in a different city with  
a start time of 7 P.M. or later, except as follows:  
(a) the in-flight time for the Club playing the prior evening is  
hours or less and the day game is on a holiday or is a home  
opener;  
(b) up to six instances per season where the traveling Club is  
traveling to Chicago to play the Cubs and the in-flight time does  
not exceed 2!/2 hours; or  
(c) the day game is a rescheduled game with an in-flight time  
of 1'/2 hours or less for any traveling Club.  
(10) Beginning in 2018, Clubs shall consult with their Player  
Representatives prior to the start of the season when determining  
whether to travel to a road game immediately upon the conclusion  
of a day game that is followed by an off-day or, alternatively, to  
travel on the off-day.  
(11) An open day shall be scheduled where travel from cities in  
the Pacific Time Zone to cities in the Eastern Time Zone is required  
except that the Office of the Commissioner may schedule up to seven  
games per championship season in each League with a starting time  
after 7 P.M. in the Eastern Time Zone which include a Club that the  
day before played a game scheduled to start prior to 5 P.M. in the  
Pacific Time Zone. In any championship season, however, no Club  
may be scheduled to play more than one game in the Eastern Time  
Zone the day after it has played a game in the Pacific Time Zone.  
(12) No Club shall be scheduled, or rescheduled if practicable, to  
play more than twenty consecutive dates without an open day. A  
rained-out game may be rescheduled to an open date in the same  
series, or to an open date at the end of the same series, if: (a) the  
open date is a road off-day for the visiting Club, and (b) the resched-  
uling does not result in the home team playing more than twenty-  
four consecutive dates without an open day.  
(13) Commencing with its second scheduled championship sea-  
son game, a Club shall not be scheduled for more than two open  
days in any seven-day period. No Club may be scheduled to have  
more than ten open days prior to the twelfth week of the champion-  
ship season. For purposes of this Article V(C)(13), a Club will not  
be credited with an open day for any day of the championship sea-  
son that precedes the Club’s first scheduled game.  
(14) Doubleheaders shall not be scheduled on consecutive dates  
in the original schedule. The original schedule may contain one  
home split doubleheader for each Club.  
(15) Twi-night doubleheaders will be limited in the original  
schedule to three per home Club per season. A twi-night double-  
header will not be scheduled on a getaway day.  
(16) Only postponed, suspended and tied games shall be  
rescheduled, except as may be required to accommodate network  
television commitments or to comply with stadium leases, in any of  
which events the rescheduling rules set forth in this Article V shall  
apply; provided, however, that any game may be rescheduled for  
any reason if as rescheduled it conforms to the rules governing the  
original schedule.  
(17) The All-Star break will contain four days, during which  
time Club championship season games shall not be played.  
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, one game per season may  
be scheduled on the Thursday following the Tuesday on which the  
All-Star Game is played, provided that (1) no Club shall be sched-  
uled more than once for this game during the term of the Basic  
Agreement; (11) the game must be scheduled no more than one time  
zone away from the time zone in which that season’s All-Star Game  
is played; and (111) there is no Sunday night game immediately prior  
to the All-Star Game. Further, any workout scheduled by a Club for  
the off-days immediately following the All-Star Game shall be vol-  
untary. No game on the Sunday night prior to the All-Star Game  
shall be played in a location more than one time zone from the loca-  
tion of that year’s All-Star Game and no Club shall be scheduled to  
play the Sunday night prior to the All-Star Game more than once  
during the term of the Basic Agreement, except to the extent neces-  
sary to fulfill existing contractual or promotional commitments;  
provided however, that in no circumstance shall a Club be required  
to play such a Sunday night game in two consecutive years or more  
than twice during the term of the Basic Agreement.  
(18) With respect to the rescheduling of any game, except for  
games rescheduled as split doubleheaders as set forth in Section  
10  
C(1), any scheduling or rescheduling rule set forth in this Article  
V may be waived by the secret ballot vote of a majority of the  
Players on the Club(s) that would be in violation of the rule. Sep-  
arate votes shall be required with regard to each game for which a  
waiver is sought. A waiver granted pursuant to this provision, as  
well as a waiver granted by the Association pursuant to Section  
C(1), shall not constitute a precedent with regard to future waiver  
requests. With respect to the rescheduling of any such game, and  
all games rescheduled pursuant to Section C(1), the Club(s) shall  
consult with the Association concerning the actual date and time  
of such rescheduled game. The Club(s) shall use best efforts to  
notify the Association in advance of notifying the Players on the  
Club(s) affected.  
D. Interleague Play  
Each Club may be scheduled to play up to twenty Interleague games  
during each championship season. In each Interleague game at an  
American League park, the Designated Hitter shall be used; at each  
Interleague game at a National League park, the Designated Hitter  
shall not be used.  
Interleague play will be scheduled on a rotating division format (e.g.  
American League East vs. National League East; American League  
East vs. National League Central), but may also include no more than  
one three- or four-game series, or two two-game series, each season  
between prime interleague rivals. In the years when the corresponding  
divisions are scheduled for Interleague play, two series of three or  
fewer games against the prime interleague rival may be played.

plied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Consumer Price  
Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers published by  
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPIW) for October 2020 and the  
denominator of which is the CPIW for October 2019.  
See Attachment 31.  
B. Maximum Salary Reduction  
(1) Maximum Salary Cut Rule  
A Club may not tender, sign or renew a Player under reserve to  
the Club pursuant to Article XX(A) of this Agreement and para-  
graph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract to a Uniform Player’s  
Contract that provides a salary for:  
13  
(a) Major League service that constitutes a reduction in  
excess of 20% of his salary for Major League service in the pre-  
vious season or in excess of 30% of his salary for Major League  
service two seasons prior to the first season covered by the new  
contract; or  
(b) Minor League service as calculated under Section 2(c)  
below that constitutes a reduction in excess of 50% of his salary  
for Minor League service in the previous season.  
(2) Calculation of Previous Seasons Salaries  
(a) Single-Year Contract—Previous Major League Salaries  
In order to calculate a Player’s salary for Major League serv-  
ice in the previous season or two seasons prior to the first season  
covered by the new contract, the following steps shall be taken:  
(1) Base Salary. The Player’s “Base Salary” shall be the  
rate of pay for Major League service contained in paragraph 2  
of the contract, or in any special covenant thereto. The Base  
Salary shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraphs  
2(a)(i1)-(v) below to determine the Player’s salary.  
(11) Deferred Compensation Adjustment. If any deferred  
compensation is included in the Base Salary, the Base Salary  
shall be adjusted to reflect the discounted present value of the  
deferred amount.  
(111) Signing Bonus Adjustment. Ifthe contract contains a  
signing bonus, the signing bonus shall be added to the Base  
Salary. If any portion of the signing bonus 1s deferred, the  
present value of the signing bonus shall be used for purposes  
of the calculation in this paragraph 2(a)(i11).  
(iv) Performance Bonus Adjustment. If the contract con-  
tains performance bonuses, regardless of whether or not any  
portion of the bonus 1s earned, the Club has the option of either  
adding the entire bonus (both earned and unearned portions) in  
the Base Salary, or excluding it from the Base Salary but  
repeating the bonus on the same terms.  
(v) Other Forms of Compensation Adjustment. If the con-  
tract contains any other forms of compensation, the determina-  
14  
tion of whether the compensation shall be included in the  
salary calculation will be determined in accordance with the  
facts in each situation. Amounts that are payable on the occur-  
rence of a specific event or events shall not be included in  
Base Salary if such event or events fail to occur within the  
specified period. If the item is included, the Club has the  
option of either including the value of the item in the Base  
Salary, or excluding it from Base Salary but repeating the item  
on the same terms.  
The following is a nonexhaustive list of other forms of com-  
pensation:  
(A) payments for performing services for a Club in addi-  
tion to skilled services as a baseball player;  
(B) cash, lump sum, payments made in accordance with  
agreed upon special covenants to compensate for trading a  
Player, releasing a Player, etc.;  
(C) the value of individual property rights granted to a  
Player by a Club;  
(D) any compensation for postactive Major League  
Baseball playing career employment; and  
(E) other payments or things of value not specifically  
made for performance as a Major League Baseball Player.  
(b) Multi-Year Contract—Previous Major League Salaries  
In order to calculate a Player’s salary for Major League serv-  
ice in the previous season or two seasons prior to the first season  
covered by the new contract, the following steps shall be taken:  
(1) Base Salary  
(A) If the annual rates of pay contained in paragraph 2  
of the contract, or in any special covenant thereto, satisfy  
the maximum salary cut rule, the rate of pay stipulated in  
the contract for the year at issue shall be the Player’s Base  
Salary.  
(B) Ifthe annual rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of  
the contract, or in any special covenant thereto, do not satisfy  
15  
the maximum salary cut rule, the average annual value  
(“AAV”) of the contract shall be the Player’s Base Salary  
for the year at issue. The AAV shall be calculated by aver-  
aging the rates of pay contained in paragraph 2 of the con-  
tract (or any special covenants thereto) for each year of the  
contract. If deferred compensation is contained in any year  
of the multi-year contract, the present value of the deferred  
amount will be used for purposes of calculating the AAV.  
(C) The Base Salary shall be adjusted in accordance  
with paragraphs 2(b)(11)-(iv) below to determine a Player’s  
salary.  
(11) Signing Bonus Adjustment. If the contract contains a  
signing bonus, the bonus, irrespective of payment dates, shall  
be prorated and included in equal amounts as part of the Base  
Salary for each year of the contract. If any portion of the sign-  
ing bonus is deferred beyond the expiration of the contract, the  
present value of the signing bonus shall be used for purposes  
of the calculation in this paragraph 2(b)(11).  
(111) Performance Bonus Adjustment. If the year of the  
multi-year contract at issue contains performance bonuses,  
they shall be treated in the same manner as in paragraph  
2(a)(iv) above.  
(iv) Other Forms of Compensation Adjustment. If the  
year of the multi-year contract at issue contains any other  
forms of compensation, they shall be treated in the same man-  
ner as in paragraph 2(a)(v) above.  
(c) Previous Season Minor League Salary  
In order to calculate a Player’s salary for Minor League serv-  
ice in the previous season, the following steps shall be taken:  
(1) Contracts That Do Not Contain a Separate Rate of Pay  
for Minor League Service. Ifasingle year contract, or the rel-  
evant year of a multi-year contract, does not contain a separate  
rate of pay for Minor League service, the Player’s salary for  
Minor League service in the previous season shall be deemed  
to be the same as his salary for performing Major League serv-  
ice as calculated pursuant to paragraph 2(a) or 2(b) above.  
16  
(11) Contracts that Contain a Separate Rate of Pay for Minor  
League Service.  
(A) If a single-year contract, or the relevant year of a  
multi-year contract, contains a separate rate of pay for  
Minor League service, and the rate of pay is higher than the  
Major League minimum salary for the preceding season  
contained in Article VI(A)(1), the Player’s salary for Minor  
League service in the previous season shall be the rate of  
pay for Minor League service that is stipulated in the con-  
tract. For purposes of this paragraph 2(c)(11)(A), the stipu-  
lated rate of pay for Minor League service contained in the  
contract shall not be adjusted to account for a signing  
bonus, performance or award bonuses, or any other forms  
of compensation provided for by the contract.  
(B) If a single-year contract, or the relevant year of a  
multi-year contract, contains a separate rate of pay for  
Minor League service, and that rate of pay is lower than  
the Major League minimum salary for the prior season  
contained in Article VI(A)(1), the Player’s salary for  
Minor League service in the previous season shall be the  
greater of the total amount of the Player’s actual baseball  
salary earnings (defined below) in that season, or the rate  
of pay stipulated for Minor League service in the Player’s  
contract for that season. A Player’s “actual baseball salary  
earnings” for purposes of this paragraph 2(c)(11)(B) shall  
include only those amounts paid to the Player as salary for  
performing services in the Major or Minor Leagues, and  
shall not include signing bonuses, performance or award  
bonuses, or any other forms of compensation provided for  
by the contract.  
(d) Fines or Suspensions  
The calculation of a Player’s previous year salaries shall  
include amounts which were not paid to a Player for the season  
by reason of any fine or suspension which may have been  
imposed on the Player, or by reason of any deduction from  
salary.  
17  
(ec) Option Years  
Option years shall be included as a year of the contract if the  
option had been fully exercised at the time of the tender, signing  
or renewal.  
(3) Disputes  
In the event of a dispute regarding a contract tender, signing or  
renewal with respect to any form of additional compensation  
referred to in paragraph (2)(a)(v) or 2(b)(iv) above, either the  
Player or Club may file a Grievance in order to obtain a determi-  
nation with respect thereto as the exclusive means of resolving  
such dispute, and both parties shall be bound by the resulting  
decision. The contract tender, signing or renewal shall be altered  
as necessary to conform to the decision, and such tender, signing  
or renewal shall remain valid.  
C. Standard Length of Season  
For the purpose of calculating a Player’s daily rate of pay, a champion-  
ship season shall be deemed to commence on the date of the first reg-  
ularly scheduled championship season game and to conclude on the  
date of the last regularly scheduled championship season game. This  
rule shall apply uniformly to all Players and all Clubs, notwithstanding  
differences in a particular Club’s schedule, except as provided other-  
wise by Article V(A) and Article XXV.  
D. Salary Continuation—Military Encampment  
Payment of Player salaries shall be continued throughout any period in  
which a Player is required to attend a regularly scheduled military  
encampment of the Reserve of the Armed Forces or of the National  
Guard during the Club’s playing season.  
E. Salary Arbitration  
The following salary arbitration procedure shall be applicable:  
(1) Eligibility.  
(a) General Rule. Any Player with a total of three or more  
years of Major League service, however accumulated, but with  
18  
less than six years of Major League service, may submit the issue  
of the Player’s salary to final and binding arbitration without the  
consent of the Club, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3)  
below. Nothing contained herein shall limit the right of any  
Player, with the consent of the Club, to submit the issue of his  
salary to final and binding arbitration.  
(b) “Super Two” Players. In addition, a Player with at least  
two but less than three years of Major League service shall be eli-  
gible for salary arbitration if: (a) he has accumulated at least 86  
days of service during the immediately preceding season; and (b)  
he ranks in the top 22% (rounded to the nearest whole number)  
in total service in the class of Players who have at least two but  
less than three years of Major League service, however accumu-  
lated, but with at least 86 days of service accumulated during the  
immediately preceding season. If two or more Players are tied at  
22%, all such Players shall be eligible.  
(2) Notice of Submission  
The Association and Major League Baseball Labor Relations  
Department (“LRD”) will confirm the list of arbitration eligible  
players promptly after the tender date. The Association and the  
LRD shall exchange salary figures on the Exchange Date, set  
forth in the schedule below:  
Year Exchange Date  
2017 Friday, January 13  
2018 Friday, January 12  
2019 Friday, January 11  
2020 Friday, January 10  
2021 Friday, January 15  
It shall be the responsibility of the Association prior to the  
Exchange Date to obtain the salary figure from the Player, and  
the LRD shall have a similar responsibility to obtain the Club’s  
figure.  
(3) Withdrawal from Arbitration. In the event the Club and  
Player reach agreement on salary before the arbitration panel  
reaches a decision, the matter shall be deemed withdrawn from arbi-  
19  
tration; provided, however, that any agreements that have not been  
reported both to the Association and the LRD by | P.M. Eastern  
Time on the Exchange Date shall not be confirmed until after the  
Club and Player exchange numbers.  
(4) Form of Submission. The Player and the Club shall  
exchange with each other in advance of the hearing single salary  
figures for the coming season (which need not be figures offered  
during the prior negotiations) and then shall submit such figures to  
the arbitration panel. At the hearing, the Player and Club shall  
deliver to the arbitration panel an executed Uniform Player’s Con-  
tract, complete except for the salary figure to be inserted in para-  
graph 2. Upon submission of the salary issue to arbitration by either  
Player or Club, the Player shall be regarded as a signed Player  
(unless the Player withdraws from arbitration as provided in para-  
graph (3) above).  
(5) Selection of Arbitrators. The Association and the LRD shall  
annually select the arbitrators. In the event they are unable to agree  
by January | in any year, they jointly shall request that the Ameri-  
can Arbitration Association furnish them lists of prominent, profes-  
sional arbitrators. Upon receipt of such lists, the arbitrators shall be  
selected by alternately striking names from the lists. All cases shall  
be assigned to three-arbitrator panels. The Association and the LRD  
shall designate one arbitrator to serve as the panel chair.  
(6) Location of Hearings. The single hearing site for each year  
will be agreed upon by the Parties with preference being given to  
either Los Angeles, Tampa/Orlando, or Phoenix.  
(7) Conduct of Hearings. The hearings shall be conducted on a  
private and confidential basis. Each of the parties to a case shall be  
limited to one hour for initial presentation and one-half hour for  
rebuttal and summation. Cross-examination of witnesses shall not  
count against the aforesaid time limitations, and such time limita-  
tions may be extended by the arbitration panel for good cause.  
The parties shall exchange all written materials to be utilized in  
their respective initial presentations at the outset of a hearing. The  
order of presentation shall be as follows:  
20  
(a) Player’s initial presentation;  
(b) Club’s initial presentation;  
(c) Player’s rebuttal and summation;  
(d) Club’s rebuttal and summation;  
(e) Player’s surrebuttal, which shall be very brief and offered  
to respond to new issues raised during the Club’s rebuttal; and  
(f) If requested by the Club, the Panel may, at its discretion,  
allow the Club very brief surrebuttal to respond to new issues  
raised by the Player.  
Notwithstanding this order of presentation, neither party shall  
carry the burden of proof.  
(8) Continuances, Adjournments or Postponements. There  
shall be no continuances or adjournments of a hearing, but the com-  
mencement of a hearing may be postponed by the arbitration panel  
upon the application of either the Player or Club based upon a show-  
ing of substantial cause. Any request for the postponement of a  
scheduled hearing shall be made to the panel chair in writing, with  
copies to the Association and the LRD. Disclosure of individual  
votes by panel members shall be in accordance with paragraph (13)  
below.  
(9) Hearing Costs. The Player and Club shall divide equally the  
costs of the hearing, and each shall be responsible for his own  
expenses and those of his counsel or other representatives.  
(10) Criteria  
(a) The criteria will be the quality of the Player’s contribu-  
tion to his Club during the past season (including but not limited  
to his overall performance, special qualities of leadership and  
public appeal), the length and consistency of his career contribu-  
tion, the record of the Player’s past compensation, comparative  
baseball salaries (see paragraph (11) below for confidential  
salary data), the existence of any physical or mental defects on  
the part of the Player, and the recent performance record of the  
Club including but not limited to its League standing and atten-  
21  
dance as an indication of public acceptance (subject to the exclu-  
sion stated in subparagraph (b)(1) below). Except as set forth in  
subsections 10(b) and 10(c) below, any evidence may be submit-  
ted which is relevant to the above criteria, and the arbitration  
panel shall assign such weight to the evidence as shall appear  
appropriate under the circumstances. The arbitration panel shall,  
except for a Player with five or more years of Major League  
service, give particular attention, for comparative salary pur-  
poses, to the contracts of Players with Major League service not  
exceeding one annual service group above the Player’s annual  
service group. This shall not limit the ability of a Player or his  
representative, because of special accomplishment, to argue the  
equal relevance of salaries of Players without regard to service,  
and the arbitration panel shall give whatever weight to such  
argument as is deemed appropriate.  
(b) Evidence of the following shall not be admissible:  
(1) The financial position of the Player and the Club;  
(11) Press comments, testimonials or similar material bear-  
ing on the performance of either the Player or the Club, except  
that recognized annual Player awards for playing excellence  
shall not be excluded;  
(111) Offers made by either Player or Club prior to arbitra-  
tion;  
(iv) The cost to the parties of their representatives, attor-  
neys, etc.;  
(v) Salaries in other sports or occupations.  
(c) Admissible Statistics. Only publicly available statistics  
shall be admissible. For purposes of this provision, publicly  
available statistics shall include data available through subscrip-  
tion-only websites (e.g., Baseball Prospectus). Statistics and data  
generated through the use of performance technology, wearable  
technology, or “STATCAST”, whether publicly available or not,  
shall not be admissible.  
22  
(11) Confidential Major League Salary Data. For its confiden-  
tial use, as background information, the arbitration panel will be  
given a tabulation showing the minimum salary in the Major  
Leagues and salaries for the preceding season of all players on  
Major League rosters as of August 31, broken down by years of  
Major League service. The names and Clubs of the Players con-  
cerned will appear on the tabulation. In utilizing the salary tabula-  
tion, the arbitration panel shall consider the salaries of all  
comparable Players and not merely the salary of a single Player or  
group of Players.  
(12) Prohibition Regarding Competitive Balance Tax. No par-  
ticipant in a salary arbitration shall refer in any fashion, either orally  
or in writing, to any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive  
Balance Tax). No salary arbitration panel shall consider in any fash-  
ion any of the provisions in Article XXIII (Competitive Balance  
Tax).  
(13) Timetable and Decision. Arbitration hearings shall be  
scheduled to be held from February 1 to February 20 absent a con-  
trary agreement of the Parties. The arbitration panel may render the  
decision on the day of the hearing, and shall make every effort to  
do so not later than 24 hours following the close of the hearing. The  
arbitration panel shall be limited to awarding only one or the other  
of the two figures submitted. There shall be no opinion. There shall  
be no release of the arbitration award by the arbitration panel  
except to the Club, the Player, the Association and the LRD. The  
panel chair shall initially inform the Association and the LRD of  
the award only and not how the panel members voted. The panel  
chair shall disclose to the Association and the LRD the individual  
votes of the panel members on each March 15 following the Feb-  
ruary hearings. The panel chair shall insert the figure awarded in  
paragraph 2 of the executed Uniform Player’s Contract delivered at  
the hearing and shall forward the Contract to the Office of the  
Commissioner.

ARTICLE VII—Expenses and Expense Allowances  
A. Transportation and Travel Expenses  
Each Club shall pay the following expenses of Players:  
(1) All proper and necessary traveling expenses of Players while  
“abroad,” or traveling with the Club in other cities, including board,  
and first-class jet air and hotel accommodations, if practicable, for  
any travel that 1s directed, requested or required by the Club. Play-  
ers who have reported to the Minor Leagues at the time of the event,  
transaction, direction or request that results in the travel will receive  
travel expenses in accordance with past practice as set forth in Article  
XIX(B) and (C)(3)(d). Home games which are scheduled or  
rescheduled away from the park of the home Club shall be consid-  
ered road games for the purposes of Players’ meal and tip  
allowances, hotel accommodations and transportation.  
(a) Air Travel. On regularly scheduled commercial flights,  
when first-class accommodations cannot practicably be provided,  
the Club shall provide a single seat in the next highest premium  
seating classification that 1s available. When first-class accom-  
modations cannot practicably be provided and Players travel in  
the coach section, the Club shall provide three seats for each two  
Players and first-class meals. If a Player is booked in a single seat  
and an upgrade to a higher classification seat becomes available  
for purchase, the Player may purchase such upgrade and the Club  
shall rer1mburse the Player for the cost of the upgrade. Beginning  
in 2018, all in-season and post-season air travel shall be non-stop.  
(b) Hotel Accommodations. Each Club shall give written  
notice to the team’s Player Representative and the Association,  
prior to December | of each year, of the hotels, including hotels  
in the Club’s home city and Spring Training hotels, that the Club  
intends to utilize during the next succeeding season. Beginning in  
2018, all hotels utilized by the Club while on the road shall have  
meals available (in-room or otherwise) until at least 1:00 A.M.;  
provided, however, that each Club’s Player Representative may  
waive this requirement.  
Each Player traveling with his Club on the road shall have sin-  
gle rooms in the Club’s hotels on all road trips during the Club’s  
Spring Training, championship season and post-season. Nothing  
24  
herein shall prohibit the Clubs from making or continuing agree-  
ments with individual Players that provide more favorable  
arrangements for such Players.  
(c) Bus Travel. During the championship season, including  
travel to the first game of such season, no Club, absent extraordi-  
nary circumstances that make travel by plane impossible, may  
travel by bus between games if the distance between the two  
cities 1s, by the most direct highway route, more than 200 miles  
(one way).  
During the championship season, the visiting Club shall  
schedule two bus trips to transport Players from the team hotel to  
the ballpark for each game. The bus trips to the ballpark shall be  
staggered in time—one early trip and one late trip. For bus trans-  
portation during Spring Training, each Club shall provide two  
adjacent seats for every Player.  
(2) First-class jet air fare and meals en route, of Players to their  
homes at the end of the season, regardless of where the Club fin-  
ished its season. If the Club finishes its season “abroad” and appro-  
priate transportation is not provided back to the Club’s home city,  
any Player who elects to return home via the Club’s home city shall  
be paid an amount equal to the first-class jet air fare and meals en  
route back to the Club’s home city plus the first-class jet air fare and  
meals en route from the Club’s home city to the Player’s home. A  
Player who has more than one home shall receive payment based on  
the home to which he actually travels.  
(3) All necessary traveling expenses, including first-class jet air  
fare and meals en route, of Players from their homes to the Spring  
Training place of the Club, whether they are ordered to go there  
directly or by way of the home city of the Club. A Player who has  
more than one home shall receive payment based on the home from  
which he actually travels.  
(4) In the case of assignment of a Player’s contract during the  
championship season or during Spring Training, all traveling  
expenses, including first-class jet air fare and meals en route, of the  
Player as may be necessary to enable him to report to the assignee  
Club. The Club shall also reimburse the Player for all travel  
expenses, including first-class jet air fare and meals en route, for the  
25  
Player’s spouse for one assignment during the championship sea-  
son. Such expenses may not be claimed by the Player as part of his  
moving expenses under Article VIII(C), unless not paid under this  
provision. A Club may offset such expenses against any moving  
allowance provided pursuant to Article VIII(A).  
(5) In the case of termination by the Club of a Player’s contract  
during the championship season or during Spring Training, reason-  
able traveling expenses, including first-class jet air fare and meals  
en route, to the Player’s home city.  
(6) In the event a Player is required to attend a regularly sched-  
uled military encampment of the Reserve of the Armed Forces or of  
the National Guard during the championship season or during  
Spring Training, the Player’s air fare to and from the encampment.  
B. In-Season Meal and Tip Allowance  
(1) During the championship season, each Player shall receive a  
daily meal and tip allowance for each date a Club is on the road and  
for each traveling day. No deductions will be made for meals served  
on an airplane.  
(2) If, when a Club departs from the home city, Players are  
required to report for departure at or prior to Noon, Players will  
receive the full daily allowance for that date; if Players are required  
to report for departure after Noon, Players will receive one-half of  
the daily allowance for that date. Returning to the home city, if  
arrival is later than 6 P.M., Players will receive the full daily  
allowance; if arrival is at or prior to 6 P.M., Players will receive one-  
half of the daily allowance.  
(3) During the 2017 championship season, the daily allowance  
shall be $30.00. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the 2017  
championship season, the daily allowance shall be $102.00 for  
Players entitled to the in-season meal and tip allowance pursuant to  
Articles IV, VII(D), VI(F)(), (3), (4), and (5), XIV(D),  
XV(E)(3)(d), XV(N)(6), XIX(C)(3)(d), Attachment 15, or for any  
day on the road or traveling day that the Club does not provide a  
meal in the Clubhouse pursuant to Attachment 47; provided, how-  
ever, that on any day a scheduled game is postponed, the daily  
allowance shall be $30.00 if the postponement occurs within two  
26  
hours of the scheduled first pitch and $102.00 if the postponement  
occurs more than two hours prior to the scheduled first pitch. Dur-  
ing the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 championship seasons, the daily  
allowance shall be the prior season’s allowance plus a cost of living  
adjustment rounded to the nearest $.50 as calculated in Article  
VII(B)(4) below. The daily allowances described herein shall not be  
reduced below $30.00 and $102.00, respectively, for the term of the  
Basic Agreement.  
(4) Cost of living adjustments shall be computed as follows.  
(a) To determine the allowance figure effective for the 2018  
season, the allowance figure for the 2017 season, as adjusted,  
shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  
Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical  
Workers (CPIW) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for  
October 2017 and the denominator of which is the CPIW for  
October 2016.  
(b) To determine the allowance figure effective for the 2019  
season, the allowance figure for the 2018 season, as adjusted,  
shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  
CPIW for October 2018 and the denominator of which is the  
CPIW for October 2017.  
(c) To determine the allowance figure effective for the 2020  
season, the allowance figure for the 2019 season, as adjusted,  
shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  
CPIW for October 2019 and the denominator of which is the  
CPIW for October 2018.  
(d) To determine the allowance figure effective for the 2021  
season, the allowance figure for the 2020 season, as adjusted,  
shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the  
CPIW for October 2020 and the denominator of which is the  
CPIW for October 2019.  
See Attachment 31.  
(5) Each Club shall provide the daily allowance to Players on a  
daily basis or in advance. Each Club is permitted to distribute the  
allowance in cash, by direct deposit or on a check card. To the max-  
imum extent possible, each Club shall provide the daily allowance  
27  
pursuant to an accountable plan whereby to the maximum extent  
possible the daily allowance will be excluded from a Player’s gross  
income. See Attachment 41.  
C. Spring Training Allowances  
(1) During the 2017 Spring Training season, each Player shall  
receive a base weekly allowance of $320.50, and each Player living  
away from the Club’s Spring Training headquarters also shall  
receive a base supplemental weekly allowance of $57.00. During  
the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 seasons, the weekly and supplemen-  
tal allowances shall be the prior season’s allowance plus the cost of  
living adjustment rounded to the nearest $.50. Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, the weekly allowance will not be reduced below  
$320.50, and the supplemental allowance will not be reduced below  
$57.00 during the term of the Basic Agreement.  
(2) A Player living away from the Club’s Spring Training head-  
quarters shall receive the following daily meal and tip allowance  
(except that Players who make an overnight trip shall receive for the  
day following the night on the road the daily championship season  
meal and tip allowance in lieu of the daily allowance provided in  
this paragraph). No deduction shall be made for lunch or sand-  
wiches served at the ballpark. In 2017, the base daily allowance  
shall be $91.00. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the daily allowance  
shall be the prior season’s allowance plus the cost of living adyjust-  
ment rounded to the nearest $.50. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  
the daily allowance will not be reduced below $91.00 during the  
term of the Basic Agreement.  
Players living at the Club’s Spring Training headquarters also  
shall receive the daily meal and tip allowance if the Club does not  
otherwise provide meals. No Player shall be required to sign meal  
checks or take his meals in lieu of receiving the daily meal and tip  
allowance.  
(3) All players who are assigned to a Major League Spring  
Training camp shall receive the allowances set forth in Section C(1)  
and (2) above, except that any non-roster players assigned to a  
Major League Spring Training camp shall receive the allowances  
only if they have Major League service at or above the prior sea-  
son’s cut-off for obtaining salary arbitration eligibility as a “Super  
28  
Two.” (See Article VI(E)(1).) All players who are not assigned to a  
Major League Spring Training camp, but who are in uniform for a  
Major League Spring Training game, shall receive the daily  
allowance set forth in Section C(2) above for each such game.  
(4) A Player living away from the Club’s Spring Training head-  
quarters shall receive a room allowance of $40.00 per day.

Section B(4) above.  
(6) Each Player shall receive first-class hotel accommodations  
and the in-season meal and tip allowance set forth in Section B  
above for the period between when a Club breaks Spring Training  
camp and Opening Day, provided that the Player is playing at his  
Club’s home city and does not have a personal residence in his  
Club’s home city.  
(7) Each Club must provide the base weekly Spring Training  
allowance to Players on a weekly basis and the daily tip allowance  
on a daily basis or in advance. Each Club is permitted to distribute  
these allowances in cash, by direct deposit or on a check card. To the  
maximum extent possible, each Club shall provide Spring Training  
allowances pursuant to an accountable plan whereby to the maxi-  
mum extent possible such allowances will be excluded from a  
Player’s gross income. See Attachment 41.  
D. All-Star and Home Run Derby Participant Benefits  
Each player elected or selected to the All-Star team or as a participant  
in the Home Run Derby and who attends the event shall receive the

E. In-Season Supplemental Allowances  
(1) A Player shall be entitled to receive the “in-season supple-  
mental allowance” provided by this Section E if:  
(a) his contract is assigned by a Minor League club to a Major  
League Club,  
(b) he had no Major League service (or his entire Major  
League service is only after the preceding August 31) and is ona  
Major League Club’s Opening Day roster, or  
(c) his contract is assigned by a Major League Club to another  
Major League Club during the championship season or after the  
sixteenth day prior to the start of the championship season.  
(2) A Player entitled to receive the in-season supplemental  
allowance shall be treated by the assignee Club as if he were on the  
road for each of the first seven days of the assignment in the  
assignee Club’s home city, to include the assignee Club providing  
the Player with first-class hotel accommodations and the applicable  
daily meal and tip allowance described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of  
Section B for this period. If this entitlement arises under paragraph  
(1)(a) or (b) above, first-class hotel accommodations shall be pro-  
vided at the Club’s expense or an allowance for housing expenses,  
not to exceed the first-class hotel accommodations rate, shall be pro-  
vided to the Player in advance on a daily basis, as long as the Player  
incurs actual housing expenses.  
(3) This in-season supplemental allowance shall be provided auto-  
matically to such a Player in advance (a) at the time of the assignment  
for assignments between Major League Clubs, and (b) on a daily basis  
if the entitlement arises under paragraph 1(a) or (b) above.  
Clubs shall, by the fifth day after the end of each month of the  
championship season, provide the Players Association with a list of  
the Players who were paid the in-season supplemental allowance  
during the preceding month and the amount of each allowance. The

30  
during the preceding month (including, for the first list of the sea-  
son, each Player on the Opening Day roster), the amount of the  
allowance paid to each, and the dates each was provided with first-  
class hotel accommodations or an allowance for housing expenses.  
(4) This Section E shall apply to each such assignment made dur-  
ing a championship season. For a covered assignment from a Minor  
League club to a Major League Club made during the off-season,  
the Player shall be entitled to the benefits provided by this Section  
E only for the days he serves on a Major League Club’s active ros-  
ter before his contract is reassigned to a Minor League club.  
(5) Any Player who does not have a personal residence in the  
Club’s home city and whose Club: (1) is selected to play on the first

day required by Article V(C)(4) the day after Opening Day rather  
than prior to Opening Day, shall be entitled to first-class hotel  
accommodations and the daily meal and tip allowance under this  
Section E for the first two days of the championship season (1.e.,  
Opening Day and the off-day following Opening Day).  
(6) A Player whose contract is assigned by a Minor League club  
to a Major League Club shall be entitled to receive the “in-season  
supplemental allowance” set forth in this Article VII(E) if the Player

incurs actual housing expenses within the meaning of Article  
VII(E)(2).  
(7) A Player returning to a Major League Club following an  
assignment to a Minor League affiliate shall be entitled to receive  
the “in-season supplemental allowance” set forth in this Article  
VII(E) only if he actually reported to the Minor League club.  
(8) A Player entitled to receive this in-season supplemental  
allowance shall not also be entitled to any portion of the in-season meal  
and tip allowance under Article VII(B) attributable to the same day.  
F. Allowances for Disabled Players  
A Player who performs prescribed rehabilitation work will receive the  
allowances set forth below depending on the location of the rehabilita-  
tion. The applicable allowances (if any) will be provided without  
31  
deduction irrespective of whether the Club directs the Player to per-  
form rehabilitation work at the site pursuant to its rights under the  
Basic Agreement, or the Player voluntarily agrees to perform rehabili-  
tation work at a particular site with the consent of the Club.

receive first-class jet air and hotel accommodations for his imme-  
diate family, and reimbursement for the cost of a family-size

32  
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (3)(a) above, Players on the  
Active List of the Arizona Diamondbacks, Miami Marlins or

dence for the championship season, and will not be entitled to: (a)  
hotel accommodations; (b) the in-season meal and tip allowance  
when the Club is at home; or (c) reimbursement for the cost of a

50 miles from the Club’s Spring Training facility must be offered  
first-class hotel accommodations reasonably proximate to the

treated for purposes of this paragraph 3 as if he lives less than or  
equal to 50 miles from the Club’s Spring Training facility. A  
Player who accepts such hotel accommodations will be treated in  
accordance with paragraph 3(a) above.  
(4) Rehabilitation During Spring Training  
A Player who performs prescribed rehabilitation work at the  
Club’s Spring Training facility shall receive the allowance to which  
he otherwise would be entitled to under Article VII(C) if he was not

Club’s home city during Spring Training will be provided with first-  
class jet air and hotel accommodations in accordance with Article  
VII(A)(1), the applicable in-season meal and tip allowance under  
Article VII(B)(1), and reimbursement for the actual cost of a mid-

(5) Rehabilitation at Other Sites  
A Player who performs prescribed rehabilitation work at the

rehabilitation work at any site other than those specified in Section  
(2), (3) or (4) above shall receive first-class air and hotel  
33  
accommodations in accordance with Article the applica-  
ble in-season meal and tip allowance under Article VIH(B)(1), and

dance with Section F(7) below. The Club’s request to the player to  
perform rehabilitation work at the applicable site must be in writing  
(a copy of which will be provided to the Association).  
(6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII(F),  
a Player will not receive hotel accommodations, the in-season meal  
and tip allowance, or rermbursement for the cost of a rental car if he  
is staying in a medical facility or at his personal residence while  
conducting rehabilitation. If a Player has a residence less than or  
equal to 50 miles from his rehabilitation site, but that residence is  
unavailable as a result of a rental or sublease commitment, the Player  
still shall be entitled to hotel accommodations and the in-season  
meal and tip allowance.  
(7) When a Player is entitled to re1mbursement for the actual  
cost of a rental car while performing rehabilitation work under this  
Section F, the Player shall, at his election, be reimbursed for the  
actual expenses he incurred for the car rental, or his actual local  
transportation expenses up to the cost he would have incurred had  
he rented a car. Notwithstanding the above, a Player will not be  
entitled to this rental car allowance if the Club provides the Player  
with a car (either mid-size or family size, whichever is applicable)  
for his exclusive use during the period of the rehabilitation. In  
order to receive reimbursement, the Player must provide the Club  
with appropriate documentation of his actual expenses.  
(8) To the maximum extent possible, each Club shall provide the  
daily meal and tip allowance pursuant to an accountable plan  
whereby the daily meal and tip allowance will be excluded from a  
Player’s gross income. See Attachment 41.  
ARTICLE Allowances  
. If a Player’s contract is assigned by a Major League Club to  
another Major League Club after the sixteenth day prior to the start of  
the championship season, but on or before the first day of the Closed  
Period under Major League Rule 9(b)(3), the assignee Club shall pay  
the Player, for all moving and other expenses resulting from such  
assignment, the sum of $1,200 if the distance between the home ball-  
34  
parks of the assignor and assignee Clubs is 1,000 air miles or less; the  
sum of $1,750 if the distance between the home ballparks of the  
assignor and assignee Clubs is greater than 1,000 air miles, up to and  
including 2,000 air miles; and the sum of $2,200 if the distance  
between the home ballparks of the assignor and assignee Clubs is  
greater than 2,000 air miles.  
This allowance will be paid to the Player automatically at the time of  
the assignment.  
This advance payment will be credited against the reimbursement for  
reasonable and actual moving expenses should the Player elect to  
claim such expenses in accordance with the provisions of Section C  
below.  
B. If a Player is assigned to another Major League Club located  
within 50 miles of the assignor Club’s home city, the Player shall not  
receive any moving allowance under Section A above, subject to the  
following exception. If a Player is assigned to another Major League  
Club and moves from a residence located further than 25 miles from  
the assignee Club’s home ballpark to a residence located closer to, and  
within 50 miles of, such ballpark, the Player shall receive the moving  
allowance in accordance with Section A above.  
C. A Player may elect, within two years after the date of the assign-  
ment of his contract, regardless of when his contract is assigned or  
whether the assignment is between Major League Clubs or a Major  
League Club and a Minor League club, to be rermbursed for the rea-  
sonable and actual moving expenses of the Player and his immediate  
family resulting therefrom, including first-class jet air transportation  
for the Player and his immediate family; provided that, if the Player  
relocates more than one year from the date of the assignment, the  
Player must relocate in the assignee Club’s home city and the Player  
must still be playing for the assignee Club at the time he incurs such  
expenses. Reimbursement shall be made by the assignee Club.  
D. A Player may elect, within two years after the date of the assign-  
ment of his contract, regardless of when his contract is assigned or  
whether the assignment is between Major League Clubs or a Major  
League Club and a Minor League club, to be reimbursed for the rea-  
sonable and actual rental payments for living quarters and furniture  
rental in the city from which he is transferred (and/or Spring Training  
location, if applicable), for which he is legally obligated after the date  
35  
of assignment and for which he is not otherwise reimbursed. Such  
rental payments shall not include any period beyond the end of a sea-  
son or prior to February 1. Reimbursement shall be made by the  
assignor Club. The Club paying reimbursement for living quarters and  
furniture rental shall have use of and/or the right to rent such living  
quarters and/or furniture for the period covered by the rental reim-  
bursement, unless the lease for such living quarters or furniture rental  
permits termination with payment of two months’ rent or less.  
In the event a Player is required to report to a Major League Club from  
a Minor League club in any year on or after September 1, the forego-  
ing paragraph shall not apply. A Player who is assigned to another  
Major League Club or a Minor League club prior to Opening Day and  
who did not accumulate any Major League Service during the prior  
season before September | shall not be entitled to receive any rental  
reimbursement, unless the Player received prior written approval for  
the rental from the Club.

quently terminated by a Club during the period between the end of the  
championship season and the beginning of the next succeeding Spring  
Training under paragraph 7(b)(2) of the Uniform Player’s Contract for  
failure to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability shall be entitled  
to receive termination pay from the Club in an amount equal to thirty  
(30) days’ payment at the rate stipulated in paragraph 2 of (1) his Con-  
tract for the next succeeding championship season, or (2) if he has no  
contract for the next succeeding championship season, in an amount

of the Contract tendered to him by his Club for the next succeeding  
championship season.  
B. Spring Training  
A Player whose Contract is terminated by a Club under paragraph  
7(b)(2) of the Uniform Player’s Contract for failure to exhibit suffi-  
cient skill or competitive ability shall be entitled to receive termination  
pay from the Club in an amount equal to thirty (30) days’ payment at  
36  
the rate stipulated in paragraph 2 of his Contract, if the termination  
occurs during Spring Training but on or before the 16th day prior to the  
start of the championship season. If the termination occurs during  
Spring Training, but subsequent to the 16th day prior to the start of the  
championship season, the Player’s termination pay shall be in an  
amount equal to forty-five (45) days’ payment at the rate stipulated in  
paragraph 2 of his Contract.  
C. In-Season  
A Player whose Contract is terminated by a Club during the champion-  
ship season under paragraph 7(b)(2) of the Uniform Player’s Contract  
for failure to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability shall be enti-  
tled to receive termination pay from the Club in an amount equal to the  
unpaid balance of the full salary stipulated in paragraph 2 of his Con-  
tract for that season.  
D. Split Contracts  
In the case of a Player who signs a Major League Contract which sets  
forth a separate rate of pay for Minor League service, the rate of pay  
to be utilized in calculating termination pay under the preceding Sec-  
tions A, B and C shall be:  
(1) the Minor League rate, if the termination occurs in the off-  
season;  
(2) the Minor League rate, if the termination occurs during  
Spring Training, but on or before the 16th day prior to the start of  
the championship season;  
(3) the Major League rate, if the termination occurs during  
Spring Training, but subsequent to the 16th day prior to the start of  
the championship season;  
(4) the Minor League rate, if the termination occurs during the  
season and the Player is, at the time of termination, in the Minor  
Leagues; and the Major League rate, if the termination occurs dur-  
ing the season and the Player is, at the time of termination, in the  
Major Leagues. In the application of this subparagraph (4), a  
Player’s Contract may not be assigned to the Minor Leagues for the  
purpose of reducing the Player’s termination pay.  
37  
Notwithstanding the above, a Player whose Contract is not assignable  
to the Minor Leagues without his consent, or a Player selected by a  
Major League Club in the immediately preceding Rule 5 draft, shall be  
entitled to receive termination pay at the Major League rate unless ter-  
minated during the championship season at a time when his Contract  
is under assignment to the Minor Leagues.  
E. Injury  
If a Player’s Contract is terminated by a Club by reason of the Player’s  
failure to render his services due to a disability resulting directly from  
injury sustained in the course and within the scope of his employment  
under the Contract, and notice is received by the Club in accordance with  
Regulation 2 of the Uniform Player’s Contract, the Player shall be enti-  
tled to receive from the Club the unpaid balance of the full salary for the  
year in which the injury was sustained, less all workers’ compensation  
payments received by the Player as compensation for loss of income for  
the specific period for which the Club is compensating him in full.  
F. Non-Duplication  
The foregoing provisions of this Article [X shall be applied regardless  
of the number of times a Player may be released during a year, subject  
to the following limitations:  
(1) The maximum amount of termination pay that a Player shall be  
entitled to receive for any year shall not exceed the amount by which:  
(a) the salary stipulated in the Player’s original Contract for  
such year exceeds  
(b) the aggregate amount which the Player earns during that  
year from any Club or Clubs, including any amounts deferred to  
later years, calculated at present value, and bonuses.  
(2) In the event a released Player refuses to accept a reasonable  
Major League Contract offered by a Club other than the Club which  
released him, such Player shall forfeit that portion of the termination  
pay that would not have been payable if such Contract had been  
accepted.

dance shall be limited to Players, except that the field manager, prior  
to being excused from such meeting, shall be given first the opportu-  
39  
nity to express his views as to the division of the pool. At the invitation  
of the Player Representative, the field manager may be present during  
the remainder of the meeting, or any part thereof. Club personnel are  
otherwise prohibited from attempting to influence or interfere with the  
Players’ division of the pool, either before or after the vote is com-  
pleted. The vote of the Players shall not be subject to alteration, except  
as may be required to conform to the Major League Rules.  
On or before the final day of the championship season, the Player Rep-  
resentative shall provide the Club with the schedules reflecting the  
vote of the Players. The Player Representative shall execute the sched-  
ules and complete them in his own handwriting. The Club shall, within  
48 hours of receipt from the Player Representatives, submit copies of  
such executed and handwritten schedules to the Commissioner’s  
Office and the Association.

amount established by averaging the percentage increase of a box  
seat ticket and the percentage increase of a reserved seat ticket and

ARTICLE XI—Grievance Procedure  
For the purpose of providing an orderly and expeditious procedure for  
the handling and resolving of certain grievances and complaints, as  
hereinafter provided, the following shall apply as the exclusive remedy  
of the Parties.  
A. Definitions  
As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:  
(1) (a) “Grievance” shall mean a complaint which involves the  
existence or interpretation of, or compliance with, any agreement,  
or any provision of any agreement, between the Association and the  
Clubs or any of them, or between a Player and a Club, except that  
disputes relating to the following agreements between the Associa-  
tion and the Clubs shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure  
set forth herein:  
(1) The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan;  
(11) The Agreement re Major League Baseball Players Ben-  
efit Plan; and  
(111) The Agreement regarding dues check-off.  
Any procedures or remedies available to the Parties for the resolu-  
tion of disputes arising under said agreements that were available as  
of their respective execution dates shall continue to be available and  
not be altered or abridged in any way as a result of this Basic Agree-  
ment between the Association and the Clubs.  
4]  
(b) Notwithstanding the definition of “Grievance” set forth in  
subparagraph (a) above, “Grievance” shall not mean a complaint  
which involves action taken with respect to a Player or Players by  
the Commissioner involving the preservation of the integrity of,  
or the maintenance of public confidence in, the game of baseball.  
Within 30 days of the date of the action taken, such complaint  
shall be presented to the Commissioner who promptly shall con-  
duct a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Procedure  
attached hereto as Appendix B. The Commissioner shall render a  
written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion  
of such hearing. The Commissioner’s decision shall constitute  
full, final and complete disposition of such complaint, and shall  
have the same effect as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration  
Panel. In the event a matter filed as a Grievance in accordance  
with the procedure hereinafter provided in Section B gives rise to  
issues involving the integrity of, or public confidence in, the  
game of baseball, the Commissioner may, at any stage of its pro-  
cessing, order that the matter be withdrawn from such procedure  
and thereafter be processed in accordance with the procedure  
provided above in this subparagraph (b). The order of the Com-  
missioner withdrawing such matter shall constitute a final deter-  
mination of the procedure to be followed for the exclusive and  
complete disposition of such matter, and such order shall have the  
same effect as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel. (See  
also Attachment 1.)  
The Association may reopen this Agreement, with reference  
solely to Section A(1)(b) and Section C of this Article, upon  
the giving of 10 days’ written notice at any time, based upon  
experience under the aforesaid Sections which, in its opinion, is  
unsatisfactory.  
Any reopening notice served by the Association, in accordance  
with the foregoing, will be based only on actual experience with  
the operation of such Sections in the processing of Grievances or  
complaints and such reopening cannot occur unless there is  
actual experience under such Sections.  
Also, in the event that the incumbent Chief Baseball Officer or  
the incumbent Special Assistant to the Commissioner leaves that  
Office, the Association may reopen this Agreement, with refer-  
42  
ence solely to Section C of this Article as it affects the role of the  
Chief Baseball Officer or the Special Assistant to the Commis-  
sioner, upon the giving of 10 days’ written notice.  
(c) Notwithstanding the definition of set forth in  
subparagraph (a) above, “Grievance” shall not mean a complaint  
or dispute which involves the interpretation or application of, or  
compliance with the provisions of the first sentence of paragraph  
3(c) of the Uniform Player’s Contract. However, nothing herein  
shall alter or abridge the rights of the Parties, or any of them, to  
resort to a court of law for the resolution of such complaint or  
dispute.  
Anything in the Grievance Procedure provided for in the Basic  
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, complaints or dis-  
putes as to any rights of the Players or the Clubs with respect to  
the sale or proceeds of sale of radio or television broadcasting  
rights in any baseball games by any kind or method of transmis-  
sion, dissemination or reception shall not be subject to said  
Grievance Procedure. However, nothing herein or in the Griev-  
ance Procedure shall alter or abridge the rights of the Parties, or  
any of them, to resort to a court of law for the resolution of such  
complaint or dispute.  
The reference herein to the above types of complaints or disputes  
shall not be deemed to define exclusively the types of complaints  
or disputes which are not subject to said Grievance Procedure.  
(2) “League” shall mean The American League of Professional  
Baseball Clubs or The National League of Professional Baseball  
Clubs.  
(3) “Commissioner” shall mean the person holding the office  
of Commissioner of Baseball as defined in the Major League  
Constitution.  
(4) “Player” or “Players” shall mean a Player or Players on the  
active roster of a Major League Club or on a disabled, restricted,  
disqualified, ineligible, suspended or military list of a Major League  
Club. The term “Player” shall also include a former Player or Play-  
ers who have a grievance or complaint arising by reason of their for-  
mer status as a Player as defined in the preceding sentence.  
43  
(5) “Club” or “Clubs” shall mean a Club or Clubs with member-  
ship in a League.  
(6) “Association” shall mean the Major League Baseball Players  
Association.  
(7) “Labor Relations Department” or “LRD” shall mean the  
Major League Baseball Labor Relations Department established by  
the Clubs, or any department of the Commissioner’s Office that  
assumes on behalf of the Commissioner the responsibilities formerly  
held by the Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee.  
(8) “Grievant” shall mean a party who initiates or appeals a  
Grievance.  
(9) “Arbitration Panel” shall mean the impartial arbitrator or,  
where either Party elects in advance of the opening of the hearing in  
a matter, a tripartite panel so empowered and composed of the  
impartial arbitrator and two party arbitrators, one appointed by the  
Association, the other appointed by the LRD. The impartial arbitra-  
tor, who shall in all instances be designated as the Panel Chair, shall  
be appointed by agreement of the Association and the LRD. In the  
event the Association and the LRD are unable to agree upon the  
appointment of the impartial arbitrator, they jointly shall request  
that the American Arbitration Association furnish them a list of  
prominent, professional arbitrators. Upon receipt of said list, they  
shall alternate in striking names from the list until only one remains.  
The arbitrator whose name remains shall be deemed appointed as  
the impartial arbitrator.  
At any time during the term of this Agreement either the Associa-  
tion or the LRD may terminate the appointment of the impartial  
arbitrator by serving written notice upon him and the other Party;  
provided that no such termination shall in any way impair the  
authority of the impartial arbitrator to render awards with respect to  
matters fully submitted to him. Within 30 days of any such termina-  
tion, the Association and LRD shall either agree upon a successor  
impartial arbitrator or select a successor from an American Arbitra-  
tion Association list, as set forth above.  
Decisions of the Arbitration Panel shall be made by the impartial  
arbitrator or, where the panel is tripartite, by majority vote.  
44  
(10) “Alternate Panel Chairs” shall mean the two impartial arbi-  
trators appointed for cases that cannot be scheduled for hearing by  
the Panel Chair within the time limit set forth in Section B below.  
Selection and termination of the Alternate Panel Chairs shall be by  
the same procedures utilized for selection and termination of the  
Panel Chair.  
B. Procedure  
Step 1. Any Player who believes that he has a justifiable Grievance  
shall first discuss the matter with a representative of his Club desig-  
nated to handle such matters, in an attempt to settle it. If the matter is  
not resolved as a result of such discussions, a written notice of the  
Grievance shall be presented to the Club’s designated representative;  
provided, however, that for a Grievance to be considered beyond Step  
1, such written notice shall be presented within (a) 45 days from the  
date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or (b) 45  
days from the date on which the facts of the matter became known or  
reasonably should have become known to the Player, whichever is  
later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written notice (within 2  
days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety  
and health), the Club’s designated representative shall advise the  
Player in writing of his decision and shall furnish a copy to the Asso-  
ciation. If the decision of the Club is not appealed further within 15  
days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be considered settled on the  
basis of that decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.  
Step 2. A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in  
writing by the Grievant or by the Association to a designated represen-  
tative of the LRD within 15 days following receipt of the Club’s writ-  
ten decision. Grievances which involve (a) more than one Club, or (b)  
a Player who is not under contract to a Club that is party to the Griev-  
ance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the  
Grievance shall be presented to the designated representative of the  
LRD within (a) 30 days from the date of the occurrence upon which  
the Grievance is based, or (b) 30 days from the date on which the facts  
of the matter became known or reasonably should have become known  
to the Player, whichever is later. A Grievance appealed to or filed at  
Step 2 shall be discussed within 35 days thereafter (within 2 days if  
disciplinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and  
health) between representatives of the LRD and representatives of the  
45  
Association in an attempt to settle it. If both Parties agree, the Player  
and Club principals will also participate in the Step 2 meeting. The  
Parties will attempt to exchange documents in advance of the Step 2  
meeting but the meeting shall occur within 35 days even if documents  
have not been exchanged by that date. Within 10 days following such  
meeting (within 2 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance  
involving Player safety and health), the designated representative of  
the LRD shall advise the Grievant in writing of his decision and shall  
furnish a copy to the Association. If the decision of the LRD represen-  
tative is not appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Griev-  
ance shall be considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall  
not be eligible for further appeal.  
Arbitration. Within 15 days following receipt of the Step 2 decision,  
the Grievant or the Association may appeal the Grievance in writing to  
the Panel Chair for impartial arbitration. The Panel Chair shall set a  
time, date and place for hearing the appeal. The Panel Chair shall  
attempt to open the hearing within one-year from the filing of the  
Grievance (within 5 days of receipt of the notice of appeal if a disci-  
plinary suspension or a Grievance involving Player safety and health).  
If the Panel Chair cannot do so given previously scheduled hearings,  
the Panel Chair shall direct that the Grievance be assigned to an Alter-  
nate Panel Chair, unless one of the Parties objects. In response to an  
objection, the Panel Chair shall select Grievance(s) to be assigned to  
particular Alternate Panel Chair(s) so that hearings for all Grievances  
will open within one year of filing. A case heard by an Alternate Panel  
Chair shall be conducted by a tripartite panel if either Party elects in  
advance of the opening of the hearing.  
All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of Pro-  
cedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Arbitration Panel shall ren-  
der a written decision as soon as practicable following the conclusion  
of such hearing (within 5 days if disciplinary suspension or a Grievance  
involving Player safety and health), and may affirm, modify or reverse  
the decision from which the appeal is taken. The decision of the Arbi-  
tration Panel shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the  
Grievance appealed to it. A decision of an Alternate Panel Chair shall  
not constitute precedent of the Arbitration Panel, but shall have the  
same precedential effect as an arbitration decision rendered outside of  
this collective bargaining relationship.  
46  
With regard to the arbitration of Grievances, the Arbitration Panel shall  
have jurisdiction and authority only to determine the existence of or  
compliance with, or to interpret or apply agreements or provisions of  
agreements between the Association and the Clubs or any of them, or  
between individual Players and Clubs. The Arbitration Panel shall not  
have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from, or alter in any  
way the provisions of such agreements. All costs of arbitration, includ-  
ing the fees and expenses of the impartial arbitrator, shall be borne  
equally by the Parties, provided that each of the Parties shall bear the  
cost of its own party arbitrator, witnesses, counsel and the like.  
C. Special Procedure with Regard to Certain  
Disciplinary Action  
Except as set forth in Article XII(E)(3)(c), complaints involving a fine  
or suspension imposed upon a Player by the Chief Baseball Officer or  
the Commissioner for conduct on the playing field or in the ballpark  
shall be subject exclusively to this Section C as follows:  
(1) Fines Exceeding $1,000 and Suspensions  
(a) The Office of the Commissioner will provide the Players  
Association with any applicable Umpire’s Incident Report con-  
temporaneously with the Notice of Discipline. Except as set forth  
in Section C(2) below (with respect to fines of $1,000 or less and  
no suspension), any Player who believes that he has a justifiable  
complaint regarding such discipline may, within 7 days of his  
receipt of written notification of the discipline, appeal in writing  
to the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, if the discipline was  
imposed by the Chief Baseball Officer, or to the Commissioner,  
if the discipline was imposed by him, for a hearing.  
(b) Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Special Assistant  
to the Commissioner or the Commissioner, as the case may be,  
shall designate a time and place for hearing the appeal, which  
hearing shall be commenced within 10 days from the date of  
receipt of the appeal. Unless the appeal involves an incident in  
which three or more players were suspended, all appeal hearings  
shall be held by videoconference, except that the Player may  
elect an in-person hearing in the following circumstances: (1) the  
Player is available for a hearing in New York during the 10-day  
period; or (11) the Player is suspended in excess of five games  
47  
(for a starting pitcher) or in excess of three games (for a position  
player or relief pitcher), in which case an in-person hearing shall  
be scheduled at a mutually agreeable location within the 10-day  
period.  
(c) Discipline for Post-season Conduct. Notwithstanding  
paragraph (b) above, a hearing involving a suspension for con-  
duct on the playing field or in the ballpark during the post-season  
shall be heard within forty-eight (48) hours of the receipt of the  
appeal. The Chief Baseball Officer, or the Commissioner, as the  
case may be, shall determine the timing of the suspension, sub-  
ject to the Player’s right to appeal and without prejudice to the  
Players Association’s position regarding past practice of the tim-  
ing of such suspensions.  
(d) Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules  
of Procedure attached hereto as Appendix B. The Special Assis-  
tant to the Commissioner, or the Commissioner, as the case may  
be, shall render a written decision as soon as practicable follow-  
ing the conclusion of such hearing, and may affirm, modify, or  
revoke the disciplinary action originally imposed. The decision  
by the Special Assistant to the Commissioner, or the Commis-  
sioner, as the case may be, shall constitute full, final and com-  
plete disposition of the complaint and shall have the same effect  
as a Grievance decision of the Arbitration Panel.  
(2) Fines of $1,000 or Less and No Suspension. If the discipline  
involves a fine in the amount of $1,000 or less and no suspension, a  
Player may, within 7 days of his receipt of written notification of the  
discipline, appeal his discipline in writing to the Chief Baseball  
Officer. Such appeals shall be conducted through an informal tele-  
phone conference at a mutually agreeable time and date.  
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section C(1) above, if any  
such discipline imposed upon a Player by the Chief Baseball Offi-  
cer involves a fine in an amount which exceeds $15,000 or a sus-  
pension exceeding 10 games, any complaint relating thereto shall be  
appealable, from the decision of the Special Assistant to the Com-  
missioner to the Commissioner for determination in the same man-  
ner and with the same effect as provided in paragraph 1(b) of  
Section A hereof.  
48  
(4) All settlements of discipline issued to a Player for conduct on  
the playing field or in the ballpark shall be non-precedential; pro-  
vided, however, that the Office of the Commissioner may consider  
a Player’s prior discipline for on-field conduct when determining  
the appropriate level of discipline for another infraction, irrespec-  
tive of whether the prior discipline was subject to a settlement  
agreement.  
D. Grievances Initiated or Appealed by a Club  
Step 1. Any Club which believes it has a justifiable Grievance shall  
present a written notice of the Grievance to the Player with a copy to  
the Association; provided, however, that for a Grievance to be consid-  
ered beyond Step 1, such written notice shall be presented within (a)  
45 days from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is  
based, or (b) 45 days from the date on which the facts of the matter  
became known or reasonably should have become known to the Club,  
whichever is later. Within 10 days following receipt of such written  
notice, the Player shall advise the Club in writing of his decision and  
shall furnish a copy to the LRD. If the decision of the Player is not  
appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be  
considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligi-  
ble for further appeal.  
Step 2. A Grievance, to be considered in Step 2, shall be appealed in  
writing by the Club or the LRD to the Association within 15 days fol-  
lowing receipt of the Player’s written decision. Grievances which  
involve (a) more than one Club, (b) more than one Player, or (c) a  
Player who is not under contract to a Club which is party to the Griev-  
ance, may be filed initially in Step 2, provided that written notice of the  
Grievance shall be presented to the Association within (a) 30 days  
from the date of the occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or  
(b) 30 days from the date on which the facts of the matter became  
known or reasonably should have become known to the Club,  
whichever is later. A Grievance appealed to or filed at Step 2 shall be  
discussed within 35 days thereafter between representatives of the  
LRD and representatives of the Association in an attempt to settle it. If  
both Parties agree, the Player and Club principals will also participate  
in the Step 2 meeting. The Parties will attempt to exchange documents  
in advance of the Step 2 meeting, but the meeting shall occur within 35  
49  
days even if documents have not been exchanged by that date. Within  
10 days following such meeting, the Association shall advise the LRD  
in writing of its decision. If the decision of the Association is not  
appealed further within 15 days of its receipt, the Grievance shall be  
considered settled on the basis of that decision and shall not be eligi-  
ble for further appeal.  
Arbitration. Within 15 days following receipt of the Step 2 decision  
of the Association, the LRD may appeal the Grievance in writing to the  
Panel Chair for impartial arbitration. The procedures to be followed in  
arbitration and the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Panel shall be as set  
forth in Section B above.  
Nothing contained in this Section D shall be deemed to limit or impair  
the right of any Club to impose discipline upon a Player or Players or  
to take any other action not inconsistent with the Uniform Player’s Con-  
tract or any agreement with the Association to which the Club is a Party.  
Any complaint or dispute which may be a subject for discipline shall  
not constitute a proper basis for a Club Grievance under this Section D.  
E. Grievances Initiated or Appealed by the Association  
(1) The Association may on its own motion appeal Grievances or  
complaints on behalf of a Player or Players as provided in this  
Grievance Procedure, except that the Association will not appeal a  
Grievance or complaint involving player discipline without the  
approval of the Player or Players concerned.  
(2) The Association may on its own motion initiate Grievances  
or complaints on behalf of a Player or Players on all matters not  
involving player discipline. Nothing herein shall interfere with the  
right of a Player who initiates a disciplinary Grievance or complaint  
to be represented by the Association at any Step of the Grievance  
Procedure.  
F. Miscellaneous  
(1) Each of the time limits set forth herein may be extended by  
mutual agreement of the parties involved.  
(2) If any Grievance is not processed in accordance with the pre-  
scribed time limits in any Step, unless an extension of time has been  
50  
mutually agreed upon, either party, after notifying the other party of  
its intent in writing, may appeal to the next Step.  
(3) Any decision which is appealable under this Grievance Pro-  
cedure but which is not appealed within the time allowed or within  
any time mutually agreed upon by the Parties shall constitute a full,  
final and complete disposition of the Grievance involved.  
(4) In any discussion or hearing provided for in the Grievance  
Procedure, a Player may be accompanied by a representative of the  
Association who may participate in such discussion or hearing and  
represent the Player. In any such discussion or hearing, any other  
party may be accompanied by a representative who may participate  
in such discussion or hearing and represent such party.  
G. Survival Following Termination of Basic Agreement  
Unless eliminated or modified following an impasse in bargaining,  
Article XI shall remain in full force and effect after termination of this  
Agreement; provided, however, that disputes arising after the termina-  
tion of this Agreement related to the legality or validity of unilateral  
changes of terms and conditions of employment following an impasse  
in bargaining and any other self-help conduct of the Parties, including  
but not limited to, unilateral changes in nonmandatory subjects of bar-  
gaining, shall not be subject to Article XI.  

### ARTICLE XIIJ—Discipline  
### A. Just Cause  
### 
The Parties recognize that a Player may be subjected to disciplinary  
action for just cause by his Club, the Chief Baseball Officer or the  
Commissioner. Therefore, in Grievances regarding discipline, the issue  
to be resolved shall be whether there has been just cause for the penalty  
imposed.  
If discipline imposed upon a Player is determined to be improper by  
reason of a final decision under this Grievance Procedure, the Player  
shall promptly be made whole.  
The term “make whole” means:  
(1) if a fine is found to have been imposed improperly, the fine  
will be promptly repaid;  
51  
(2) any salary loss as a result of an improper suspension will be  
promptly paid;  
(3) in the application of items (1) and (2) above, interest will also  
be paid at the rate per annum set forth in Article XV(K) below; and  
(4) crediting the Player with performance statistics for the pur-  
pose of determining whether a performance level contained in any  
special covenant to his Uniform Player’s Contract has been met.  
Such credit shall be determined by multiplying the Player’s relevant  
average per game statistic while he was on a Club’s Active List for  
the current championship season by the number of games for which  
the Arbitration Panel determines the Player was improperly sus-  
pended and adding that product to the Player’s year-end total. Such  
credit shall not be awarded to a Player for such time that his suspen-  
sion covers time the Player is on the Disabled List.  
B. Conduct Detrimental or Prejudicial to Baseball  
Players may be disciplined for just cause for conduct that is materially  
detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of Baseball  
including, but not limited to, engaging in conduct in violation of fed-  
eral, state or local law. The Commissioner and a Club shall not disci-  
pline a Player for the same act or conduct under this provision. In cases  
of this type, a Club may only discipline a Player, or take other adverse  
action against him, when the Commissioner defers the disciplinary  
decision to the Club.  
C. Notice  
Written notice of discipline of a Player (a fine, or suspension, or both)  
imposed by the Commissioner of Baseball, the Chief Baseball Officer,  
or a Club (except for actions arising from participation in the Winter  
Leagues) and the reason therefore shall in every case be given to the  
Player and the Association.  
With respect to discipline imposed upon a Player by the Chief Base-  
ball Officer or the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall immedi-  
ately give to the Association notice by e-mail of fines, suspensions  
and appeals for hearings.  
52  
D. Investigations and Discovery  
Upon receiving notice from the Office of the Commissioner that it is  
conducting an investigation of a Player (or Players) that may result in  
discipline, the Player and the Association shall provide reasonable  
cooperation with the investigation, including but not limited to produc-  
ing documents and information. However, the Player and the Associa-  
tion reserve all of their rights to assert that any investigatory request  
from the Office of the Commissioner does not require cooperation  
because the request is unreasonable, irrelevant, overbroad, or ambigu-  
ous, or the requested information is covered by a recognized privilege.  
Disputes regarding whether a Player or the Association has provided  
reasonable cooperation in a particular context shall be resolved by the  
Arbitration Panel on an expedited basis.  
The Office of the Commissioner may conduct investigatory interviews  
of Players. Except where circumstances require expeditious handling,  
the Player and the Association shall receive reasonable advance notice  
of any investigatory interview with a Player. Where circumstances  
requiring expeditious handling are present, the Player and the Associ-  
ation shall as much advance notice as is possible, but in no  
event shall the Association receive less notice than the Player. All par-  
ties recognize the right of the Player to be represented at such inter-  
view by the Association and counsel of his choice.  
At the conclusion of the Office of the Commissioner’s investigation,  
but prior to the imposition of any discipline, the Parties shall conduct  
a pre-discipline conference. The Parties’ discussion at this conference  
shall be considered confidential and inadmissible in any Grievance  
challenging the discipline that may be imposed on the Player. At or  
before this pre-discipline conference, the Office of the Commissioner  
shall describe the results of its investigation and the evidence support-  
ing discipline.  
A Player who is disciplined shall have the right to discover, in timely  
fashion, all documents and evidence adduced during any investigation  
of the charges involved, including but not limited to any documents or  
evidence in the possession of the Office of the Commissioner that tend  
to negate a Player’s guilt, to mitigate punishment, or to impeach any  
witness who will appear at any hearing challenging discipline.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section D is not intended to super-  
sede or alter in any way the Parties’ respective rights and positions  
53  
with respect to the meaning and application of Article XII(A) and (B)  
or Panel Decision No. 41 (Ferguson Jenkins).  
E. Compliance  
(1) Nothing contained in the Grievance Procedure shall excuse a  
Player from prompt compliance with any discipline imposed upon  
him.  
(2) Club Fines. A fine imposed by a Club pursuant to Regula-  
tion 5 of the Uniform Player’s Contract in excess of $10,000 may  
not be deducted from the Player’s salary until such fine is finally  
upheld in the Grievance Procedure or the time in which to file a  
Grievance has expired.  
(3) Discipline Imposed by the Chief Baseball Officer or Com-  
missioner.  
(a) A fine imposed by the Chief Baseball Officer or the Com-  
missioner in excess of $10,000 may not be deducted from the  
Player’s salary until such fine is finally upheld in the Grievance  
Procedure or the time in which to file a Grievance has expired.  
(b) The Player’s employing Club is authorized, at the request  
of the Chief Baseball Officer, or the Commissioner in the case of  
a fine imposed by the Commissioner, to deduct the amount of the  
fine from the Player’s salary and transmit such sum to the Com-  
missioner once the fine may be deducted from the Player’s salary.  
(c) The Chief Baseball Officer may choose to suspend a Player  
without pay for: (1) intentionally throwing a baseball, equipment  
or other object at a non-uniformed personnel with the intent of  
causing bodily harm; (11) physically assaulting a fan or member  
of the media; (111) physically assaulting an umpire in a manner  
that endangers his health or safety; and (iv) making public state-  
ments that question the integrity of the game, the umpires, the  
Commissioner and/or other Commissioner’s Office personnel.  
Suspensions without pay for such conduct shall be appealable  
through the procedures of Article XI(B) in an expedited manner,  
and the suspensions shall be stayed pending the completion of  
those procedures.  
54  
F. Major League Rules 15 and 16  
The following time limit provisions set forth in Major League Rules 15  
and 16 shall be inapplicable in disciplinary matters:  
(1) the prohibition in Rule 16(a) against reinstatement of a  
Player on the Restricted, Disqualified and Ineligible Lists in the  
period August | to October 31, inclusive;  
(2) the prohibition in Rules 15(c)(1) and 16(c) against applica-  
tion for reinstatement from the Ineligible List until after the lapse of  
one year from the date of placement on such list; and  
(3) the requirement of Rule 16(a) that the Player’s Club shall be  
entitled to 30 days’ written notice prior to his reinstatement from the  
Disqualified or Ineligible Lists, if application for such reinstatement  
is filed after February 1 of any year.  
ARTICLE XIII—Safety and Health  
A. Safety and Health Advisory Committee  
(1) Safety and Health Advisory Committee  
The Parties shall establish and maintain a bipartisan Safety and  
Health Advisory Committee which shall be comprised of an equal  
number of members representing the Association and representing  
the Clubs. The purpose of the Committee shall be  
(a) to deal with emergency safety and health problems as they  
arise, and attempt to find solutions, and  
(b) to engage in review of, planning for and maintenance of  
safe and healthful working conditions for Players.  
(2) Committee Meetings  
A meeting of the Safety and Health Advisory Committee may be  
called by any member thereof who believes that an emergency  
safety and health problem exists and requires immediate attention,  
and a meeting shall be held as soon as practicable thereafter. In addi-  
tion, the Committee shall hold at least one regular meeting annually  
for purposes of review and planning.  
55  
(3) Power and Authority of Committee  
The Safety and Health Advisory Committee shall make recom-  
mendations to the Parties as to the solution of problems and the  
establishment of policies. The Committee shall use its best efforts to  
persuade the Parties to adopt the Committee’s recommendations.  
The Committee, however, shall only have advisory authority and it  
shall not have the power to impose its views or recommendations  
upon the Parties.  
(4) Other Rights and Remedies  
The Players Association may file and pursue through arbitration  
a grievance concerning safety and health. The Parties will attempt to  
avoid grievances on this subject by making every reasonable effort  
to utilize the Safety and Health Advisory Committee. However, it is  
not a necessary prerequisite to utilization of the Grievance Proce-  
dure that the Safety and Health Advisory Committee procedures be  
instituted or exhausted. Nothing herein shall diminish or interfere  
with any other rights and remedies the Players or the Association  
may pursue under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement or  
under the procedures established pursuant to the Occupational Safety  
and Health Act.  
B. Safety Complaints—Responsibility of the Commissioner  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section A, when a safety complaint  
is made by the Association to the Office of the Commissioner, the  
Commissioner shall promptly designate a representative to investigate  
and to attempt to resolve the problem. The Commissioner shall  
promptly notify the Association of the results of the investigation and  
of all attempts to resolve the problem.  
C. Disabled List  
Application by a Club to the Commissioner to place a Player on the  
Disabled List shall be accompanied by a Standard Form of Diagnosis  
(see Attachment 5), a copy of which shall be provided to the Player and  
the Association. The Standard Form of Diagnosis shall be completed  
by the Club Physician and shall include, as a separate item, an estt-  
mated time period for recovery. The Club Physician will also complete  
56  
and submit the Standard Form of Diagnosis for recertification of a  
Player on the Disabled List at the date when he first becomes eligible  
for reinstatement to active status and then every ten days following the  
date upon which the Player first became eligible for reinstatement  
(except for Players placed on the 60-day Disabled List). In addition  
to the Standard Form of Diagnosis, the Office of the Commissioner  
may request that a Club provide additional information in support of a  
Disabled List placement before the application is approved by the  
Commissioner. The Club shall provide a copy of such additional infor-  
mation to the Association.  
A Club requesting the placement of a Player on the Disabled List for a  
concussion shall submit, in lieu of a Standard Form of Diagnosis, a  
Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form (see Attachment 36), a copy  
of which shall be provided to the Player and the Association. The  
Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form shall be completed by the Club  
Physician and Certified Athletic Trainer and shall include the specified  
supporting documentation. The Club Physician also must complete  
and submit the Concussion-Specific Diagnostic Form for recertifica-  
tion of a Player on the Disabled List for a concussion at the date when  
he first becomes eligible for reinstatement to active status and then  
every ten days following the date upon which the Player first became  
eligible for reinstatement (except for Players placed on the 60-day Dis-  
abled List for a concussion). Prior to the time that a Player on the Dis-  
abled List for a concussion is permitted to play in any game, the Club  
must submit a Return to Play form and supporting information to the  
Medical Director of the Office of the Commissioner (see Attachment  
36), a copy of which shall be provided to the Player and the Associa-  
tion. The Player’s return must be approved prior to the time that he will  
be removed from the Disabled List. See Attachment 36.  
D. Second Medical Opinion  
Within 20 days following the execution of this Agreement, the Clubs  
shall provide an updated, accepted listing of medical specialists, by  
specialty and by geographic region, to whom Players may upon their  
request go for diagnosis and a second medical evaluation of an  
employment-related illness or injury being treated by the Club Physi-  
cian. At least two board-certified physicians shall be designated for  
each specialty in each of the geographic regions, and all the physicians  
57  
on the list shall be board-certified in an appropriate medical specialty.  
The Commissioner’s Medical Advisory Committee, in consultation  
with a medical professional designated by the Association, shall  
review and update the list of specialists on an annual basis. The Asso-  
ciation shall have 30 days from the date of receiving an updated list  
within which to recommend additions to or deletions from the list.  
Prior to undergoing a “second evaluation,” a Player shall inform the Club  
in writing of his decision to seek a second medical opinion, and the name  
of the physician who will be performing the diagnosis and medical  
evaluation. A Player may seek a “second evaluation” from a medical  
specialist on the accepted listing who is located outside of the geographic  
region within which the Player’s Club 1s located, provided that the Player  
is not absent from the Club for an unreasonable period of time.  
If a Player uses the services of a medical specialist who is on the  
accepted listing, the Club shall pay the cost of the “second evaluation,”  
including transportation and hotel costs.  
Expenses for “second evaluations” by medical specialists who are not  
on the accepted listing shall be authorized and paid only by prior writ-  
ten agreement between the Player and the Club.  
See Attachment 35.  
E. Certified Athletic Trainers  
Each Club shall employ two Certified Athletic Trainers on a full-time  
basis. Both trainers will travel with the Club on the road; provided,  
that one trainer may remain in the Club’s home city if necessary for  
the Club to fulfill its obligations to disabled players who do not travel  
with the Club.  
Individuals newly appointed as trainers shall be certified by the  
National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA) or the Canadian Ath-  
letic Therapists Association (CATA), or shall be physical therapists  
licensed by an appropriate state authority.  
F. Locker Room Equipment  
Each visiting locker room shall be equipped with the following equip-  
ment, all in good working order, and of a size and capacity adequate  
for the treatment of professional baseball players: whirlpool, hydrocu-  
lator, ultrasound machine and examining table.  
58  
G. Disclosure of Medical or Health Information  
(1) Each year upon reporting to Spring Training, or upon signing  
a Major League Uniform Player’s Contract for that season,  
whichever is earlier, each Player must, consistent with Paragraph  
6(b)(1) of the UPC, execute the Authorization for the Use and/or  
Disclosure of Major League Player Health Information (“Authoriza-  
tion’) attached as Attachment 18 hereto.  
(2) Notice of and Authorization for Medical Care  
(a) Work-Related  
A Player shall provide his Club with reasonable advance  
notice of any treatment conducted by a health care provider in  
connection with a disability directly resulting from an injury  
sustained in the course and within the scope of his employment  
(including an elective procedure) (collectively referred to as a  
“Work-Related Injury’’), unless such health care provider is affil-  
iated with the Club. Any treatment a Player receives for a Work-  
Related Injury by a health care provider who is not affiliated  
with the Club must be authorized by the Club in advance of the  
treatment in accordance with Regulation 2 of the UPC. If such  
treatment involves a surgery or invasive procedure, such author-  
ization must be in writing.  
A Player is not required to provide his Club with notice of a  
consultation or evaluation of a Work-Related Injury by a health  
care provider who is not affiliated with the Club provided that the  
Player: (1) receives no treatment in connection with the consulta-  
tion or evaluation; (11) does not submit to an invasive test or pro-  
cedure; and (111) is not invoking his right to a Second Medical  
Opinion under Section D of this Article. In addition, if such an  
evaluation or consultation was not authorized by the Club, the  
Club will not be responsible under Regulation 2 of the UPC for  
any expenses incurred by the Player in connection with it.  
(b) Non-Work-Related  
A Player is not required to provide a Club with reasonable  
advance notice of a treatment for a disability, injury or condition  
(including an elective procedure) that is not work-related (collec-  
tively referred to as a “Non-Work-Related unless the  
59  
nature of the Non-Work-Related Injury may affect the Player’s  
ability to provide services as required by the UPC, in which case  
the Player must provide the Club with advance notice of any  
treatment. In addition, a Player will be excused from any notice  
requirement if the treatment is in response to a medical emer-  
gency, and there is insufficient time to contact the Club.  
A Club will not be responsible under Regulation 2 of the UPC  
for any expenses incurred by the Player for the treatment of a  
Non-Work-Related Injury.  
(3) Any Club Physician or Certified Athletic Trainer treating a  
Player pursuant to Regulation 2 of his UPC and any other physician  
or medical professional treating or consulting with a Player pursuant  
to Regulation 2 of the UPC or Article XIII(D) is authorized to dis-  
close all relevant medical or health information concerning the  
Player to (a) the Club by which the Player is employed, including  
the Club officials set out in the Authorization, (b) any entity from  
which such Club seeks to procure, or has procured, an insurance  
policy covering such Player’s life or any disability, injury, illness, or  
condition, such Player may suffer or sustain, (c) subject to Para-  
graph 6(b)(2) of the UPC, physicians and officials of a Club con-  
templating the assignment of the Player’s UPC, and (d) subject to  
the terms of paragraph (5) below, the Office of the Commissioner.  
(4) For public relations purposes, a Club may disclose the fol-  
lowing general information about employment-related injuries: (a)  
the nature of a Player’s injury, (b) the prognosis and the anticipated  
length of recovery from the injury, and (c) the treatment and surgi-  
cal procedures undertaken or anticipated in regard to the injury. For  
any other medical condition that prevents a Player from rendering  
services to his Club, a Club may disclose only the fact that a med-  
ical condition is preventing the Player from rendering services to the  
Club and the anticipated length of the Player’s absence from the  
Club. A Club Physician or Certified Athletic Trainer treating a  
Player pursuant to Regulation 2 of his UPC and any other physician  
or medical professional treating or consulting with a Player pursuant  
to Regulation 2 or Article XIII(D) shall be prohibited from making  
any public disclosure of a Player’s medical information absent a  
separate, specific written authorization from the Player authorizing  
such public disclosure.  
60  
(5) A Club (and any physician, certified athletic trainer or other  
medical professional treating, or consulting with, a Player pursuant  
to Regulation 2 of his UPC or Article XIII(D)) shall provide med-  
ical or health information covered by the Authorization to the Office  
of the Commissioner and to the Association as required by Article  
XIII(C), Attachment 5 and Major League Rule 2(g) and, upon writ-  
ten request, when a Player’s medical and/or health condition is at  
issue in a grievance or a potential grievance. The medical or health  
information also shall be provided to the Office of the Commis-  
sioner (with a copy to the Association) when such records are rele-  
vant to an investigation of whether the Player violated the Basic  
Agreement, his UPC or Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Pre-  
vention and Treatment Program, provided that the Office of the  
Commissioner first provides the Association with notice of its intent  
to request such records and an opportunity to object. In the event the  
Association objects to such a request by the Office of the Commis-  
sioner (which objection must be made within three business days  
after notice is provided), any dispute arising from such objection  
shall be resolved by the Arbitration Panel within seven days of the  
Association’s objection. In any such arbitration, the Commis-  
sioner’s Office shall be required to show that its request is reason-  
ably related to the matter under investigation.  
(6) If a Player on a visiting Club receives medical treatment  
from the home Club’s Physician, Certified Athletic Trainer or other  
medical professional for a Work-Related Injury, a copy of any writ-  
ten medical evaluation prepared by the home Club’s medical profes-  
sional shall be provided to the Player and his Club’s physician.  
(7) The following procedures shall govern the dissemination of  
medical records of a free agent Player:  
(a) At the conclusion of the Player’s season (including any  
applicable post-season), a Player who will become a free agent  
pursuant to Article XX(B) of the Basic Agreement may request  
that his former Club provide him with a disk containing a copy of  
his medical records. A Club shall provide such records within 10  
days of such request. When a free agent provides a Club with  
medical records, he must represent on a form provided by the  
Commissioner’s Office that he 1s providing a complete copy of  
the records that were provided to him by the Club.  
61  
H.  
(b) Any Player who is a free agent by operation of the Basic  
Agreement will receive from the Office of the Commissioner,  
upon request of the Association, log-in instructions that will per-  
mit him to access his medical records electronically. The Office  
of the Commissioner will send the log-in instructions within 10  
days of being provided written notice by the Association of the  
names and addresses of the Players who desire such instructions.  
A Player may provide to prospective Clubs (or to other individu-  
als) electronic access to his medical records, and such access  
shall remain active for 180 days.  
(c) The procedures set forth in (a) and (b) above are the exclu-  
sive procedures for the dissemination of medical records by the  
Office of the Commissioner and Clubs to free agent Players.  
Location of Rehabilitation Facilities  
(1) Rehabilitation During the Championship Season  
A Club may direct a Player to perform prescribed rehabilitation  
work for an injury during the championship season at a rehabilita-  
tion facility at one of the following four sites: (a) in the Club’s home  
city; (b) on the road with the Club; (c) at the Club’s Spring Training  
facility; or (d) at a rehabilitation facility specializing in the treat-  
ment of the Player’s injury; provided, however, that a Club may not

injury at its Spring Training facility or a facility specializing in treat-  
ment of the Player’s injury located outside of the Club’s home city  
for a period of more than 20 days without the Player’s written con-  
sent. If a Club directs a Player to a facility specializing in treatment  
of the Player’s injury, the facility must offer equivalent services,  
facilities and personnel (including bilingual personnel if applicable)  
to the Club’s Spring Training facility. The Club also will give pref-  
erence to a facility located near the Player’s off-season residence (if  
applicable).  
(2) Rehabilitation During the Off-Season  
A Club may only direct a Player to perform prescribed rehabili-  
tation work during the off-season at a rehabilitation facility in the  
metropolitan area of the Player’s off-season residence.  
62  
(3) Rehabilitation During Spring Training  
A Club may only direct a Player to perform prescribed rehabilita-  
tion work during Spring Training at a rehabilitation facility at one of  
the following three sites: (a) the Club’s Spring Training facility; (b)  
in the Club’s home city; or (c) at a rehabilitation facility specializing  
in the treatment of the Player’s injury; provided, however, that a Club  
may not direct that a Player perform prescribed rehabilitation work  
at a facility specializing in treatment of the Player’s injury located  
outside of the Club’s Spring Training city or home city for a period  
of more than 20 days without the Player’s written consent, and such  
facility must meet the criteria specified in subsection H(1) above.  
(4) Regardless of the site of the rehabilitation facility, each Club  
shall provide first-class rehabilitation facilities and care to all dis-  
abled Players.  
I. Medical History Questionnaire  
Each Club shall utilize the Medical History Questionnaire developed  
by the Club physicians in connection with the Club’s initial physical  
examination of the Player. The current Medical History Questionnaire  
is attached hereto as Attachment 6.  
J. Sports Psychologists  
Each Club shall provide Players with access, on a voluntary basis, to  
confidential sports psychology resources in a private space. Clubs that  
employ or provide Player access to a sports psychologist or psycholo-  
gist under the Club’s Employee Assistance Program shall be deemed  
to have satisfied this requirement.  
K. Strength and Conditioning Advisory Committee  
(1) Strength and Conditioning Advisory Committee  
The Parties shall maintain a joint Strength and Conditioning  
Advisory Committee (“SCAC”) which shall consist of an equal  
number of members representing the Clubs and the Association. The  
purposes of the SCAC shall be:  
63  
(a) to establish and maintain minimum credentials and profes-  
sional qualifications for strength and conditioning coaches  
employed by Major League Clubs;  
(b) to advise Clubs and Players on the existing regulations of  
the Commissioner’s Office related to strength and conditioning;  
(c) to maintain standards applicable to all Clubs concerning  
the availability of food products for Players in Major League

(d) to develop Club-specific plans and/or league-wide mini-  
mum requirements to make available to Players the NSF Certified  
for Sport supplements they desire during the championship sea-  
son, off-season and Spring Training, pursuant to Section K(3)  
below;  
(e) to develop improved standards for home and visiting  
weight rooms pursuant to Section K(4) below;  
(f) to advise the Parties on the content of educational pro-  
grams and materials involving proper nutrition, nutritional sup-  
plements, training and conditioning; and  
(g) to address other matters relating to the strength and condi-  
tioning of Players.  
(2) Committee Meetings  
A meeting of the SCAC may be called by any member who  
believes that there is an immediate need to address a matter set forth  
in Section K(1) above. In addition, the SCAC shall have at least two  
(2) regular meetings during each calendar year.  
(3) Nutritional Supplements  
Each Club shall be required to provide certain categories of NSF  
Certified for Sport nutritional supplements to all 25-man roster  
Players during the championship season (including while on the  
road), all 40-man roster Players during the off-season and Spring  
Training, its AAA affiliates during the championship season, and to  
any Player who becomes a free agent under Article XIX or Article  
XX (limit one off-season if the free agent does not sign a Major  
League contract), as determined by the SCAC.  
64  
(4) Weight Rooms  
The SCAC will develop improved standards for home and visit-  
ing weight rooms. These weight room standards will include mini-  
mum requirements for the following criteria: square footage,  
climate control, equipment, equipment maintenance/replacement  
and any other criteria established by the SCAC. In Major League  
ballparks where it is not practicable to meet the weight room stan-  
dards developed by the SCAC, off-site accommodations or other  
areas (including providing visiting Clubs with access to the home  
weight room) will be identified and established. The SCAC will also  
establish an audit process to identify Clubs that fail to satisfy the  
standards established under this provision.  
(5) Off-Season Strength and Conditioning Programs  
Clubs may not require or request that a Player pay for all or part  
of an off-season strength and conditioning or training program that  
is mandated or recommended by the Club.  
ARTICLE XIV—Spring Training Conditions  
A. Reporting  
No Player shall be required to report for Spring Training workouts

65  
C. Meetings with Players  
The Association shall have the right to hold one team meeting during  
the Players’ normal working hours, with the Players on each Club in  
the Club’s Spring Training clubhouse, provided the Association gives  
the Club involved as much advance notice as possible, but in no event  
less than 10 days; such meeting to be approximately 60 minutes but not  
more than 90 minutes in duration starting with the normal reporting  
time of Players on each Club, but not earlier than 8:00 A.M. No “B”  
games shall be scheduled to conflict with such meetings.

allowance under Article VII(B)(1), regardless of whether the Player’s  
Club is at home or traveling on the road.  
ARTICLE XV—Miscellaneous  
A. No Discrimination  
The Clubs will not interfere with, restrain or coerce Players because of  
membership in or lawful activity on behalf of the Association, nor will  
they discriminate because of Association activity in regard to hire,  
tenure, or employment, or any term or condition of employment.  
The provisions of this Agreement shall be applied to all Players cov-  
ered by this Agreement without regard to race, color, religion, national  
origin, sexual orientation, or any other classification protected under  
Federal Law.  
B. Parking Facilities  
Each Club shall provide or arrange for appropriate automobile parking  
spaces for Players and, to the extent practicable, van and small truck  
parking spaces for Players, at its home ballpark on game or practice  
days, without cost to the Players.  
66  
C. Winter League Play  
No Major League Player shall be required to play in the Winter  
Leagues, provided that this provision shall not bar a Club from recom-  
mending the advisability of such activity to any Player.  
D. [Reserved]  
E. Active Player Limit  
(1) Except as set forth in Major League Rule 2(c), the active  
Player limit for the period beginning with Opening Day of the  
championship season and ending at Midnight, August 31, shall be  
25, provided that the minimum number of active Players maintained  
by each Club throughout the championship season shall be 24.  
However, if a reduction below 24 occurs as a result of unforeseen  
circumstances, the Club shall, within 48 hours (plus time necessary  
for the Player to report), bring its active roster back to a minimum  
of 24 Players. The utilization or non-utilization of rights under this  
paragraph (1) is an individual matter to be determined solely by  
each Club for its own benefit. Clubs shall not act in concert with  
other Clubs.  
(2) The active Player limit set forth in Major League Rule 2(c)  
for the period beginning with September | and ending with the close  
of the championship season shall be 40 for the duration of this  
Agreement.  
(3) Prohibition on Taxi Squads  
(a) A Player who is directed to report to the Major League  
Club during the championship season in connection with his  
potential selection or recall to the Major League Active Roster  
must report to the Club upon his arrival in the Club’s city (or the  
city of the Club’s opponent); provided, however, that a Player  
may be directed by a Club to report on the day following his day  
of arrival if: (1) the Player arrives in the Club’s city (or the city of  
the Club’s opponent) after the time by which the Club’s Players  
are required to arrive for a workout or pre-game activities; or (11)  
there is no game or workout scheduled for the day the Player  
arrives. For purposes of this subparagraph, all Players will be  
deemed to have reported to the Club no later than the day after  
67  
the Player arrives in the Club’s city (or the city of the Club’s  
opponent).  
(b) A Player who reports to the Major League Club during the  
championship season in connection with his potential selection or  
recall to the Major League Active Roster cannot remain with the  
Major League Club unless he is added to the Major League  
Active Roster by the earlier of 8:00 P.M. Eastern Time, or three  
hours prior to the Club’s scheduled game, on the day after the  
Player reports. If a Player directed to report is not added to the  
Major League Active Roster within the time limit set forth in this  
paragraph, the Player may not remain with the Major League  
Club (including remaining in the Major League Club’s city at the  
request of the Club). When a Club directs a Player to report to the  
Major Leagues and then returns the Player to the Minor League  
club without selecting or adding him to the Active Roster, the  
return must be justified based on a change in the circumstances  
that led the Club to anticipate the Player’s selection or recall.  
(c) During the period between reporting to the Club and being  
added to the Active Roster, a Player may participate in one work-  
out and/or orientation without receiving Major League salary or  
service, but may not be in uniform for a game or otherwise  
occupy the bullpen, dugout, or field after the official end of his  
Club’s batting practice.  
(d) A Player shall receive the applicable in-season meal and  
tip allowance under Article VII(B), regardless of whether the  
Club is at home or on the road, for the day he reports to the Club  
pursuant to subparagraph 3(a) above. For Players who are added  
to the Active Roster, the in-season supplemental allowances pro-  
vided for by Article VII(E) (to the extent applicable) shall com-  
mence on the day that they are added to the Active Roster. A  
Player who is returned to the Minor Leagues on the day after  
reporting (pursuant to subparagraph 3(b) above) shall be entitled  
to the Article VII(B)(1) allowance on the day of his return only if  
he joins his Minor League club after the start of the Minor  
League club’s game (or he arrives after 6:00 P.M. if no Minor  
League game is scheduled).  
(ec) A Player assigned from a Major League Club to a Minor  
League club may not remain with the Major League Club for  
68  
more than 24 hours. Nothing contained in this paragraph is  
intended to affect the 72-hour reporting requirement contained in  
Regulation 7 of the UPC.  
(f) Players who are not on the Club’s Opening Day Major  
League Active Roster on the day that the championship season  
commences for any Club may not remain with the Major League  
Club after the time by which Opening Day rosters must be fixed.

The costs for the translation and printing shall be borne equally by  
the Association and the Clubs. In the event of any dispute involving  
the interpretation of, or compliance with, the provisions of this  
Agreement or these notices, the English version shall govern.

they prefer to receive all notices and forms in English or Spanish. At  
a Player’s election, his Club shall be obligated to translate into  
Spanish any notice or form it provides to him pursuant to the Basic  
Agreement, Major League Rules, or Uniform Player’s Contract, or  
otherwise; provided, however, that the failure to provide notice in  
Spanish shall not constitute a default of the Club’s obligation to pro-  
vide such notice if the notice was timely provided in English.  
(2) English Language Acquisition  
(a) ESL Courses.  
During each championship season covered by this Agreement,  
each Club will make available an English-as-a-second-language  
course, at its expense, provided that at least one Player on that  
Club requests such a course.  
(b) Mobile Application. The Association and the Commis-  
sioner’s Office shall jointly identify and make available to play-  
ers an English-language learning mobile application to allow  
players to pursue additional learning on off-days, or during the  
off-season, and shall provide a license to use that software to any  
player who requests one. A player who has one day of Major  
League service during a season shall be eligible to receive a  
license for the software for the duration of the season. All  
expenses related to the application shall be funded jointly  
through the International Signings Tax Fund described in Attach-  
ment 46 of the 2012—16 Basic Agreement (“ITF”).  
70  
(3) Bilingual Media Coordinator  
(a) Translation. Each Club shall retain a full-time, year-

lish and Spanish, and have excellent written and oral communi-  
cation skills in English and Spanish. The Coordinator should  
have excellent interpersonal skills and the ability to handle con-

(iii) 2019 $50,000  
(iv) 2020 $50,000  
(v) 2021 $50,000  
Such reimbursement shall be jointly funded through the ITF. An

another Club) shall not limit a Club’s eligibility for reimburse-  
ment hereunder, so long as that individual satisfies the qualifica-  
tions listed in subsection (b), above, and performs the duties  
listed in subsection (a) above. The Players Association shall have  
the right to review each candidate with the Commissioner’s  
Office to confirm compliance with the Basic Agreement and eli-  
gibility for the subsidy.  
G. Future Expansion  
During the term of this Agreement, the Clubs have the right to expand  
the number of Major League Clubs by adding up to two (2) new  
Expansion Clubs. Notice of a decision to expand by two Clubs shall  
promptly be given to the Association and the Association may reopen  
this Agreement with reference solely to the effect upon the Players of  
such expansion, upon the giving of 10 days’ written notice.  
H. Future Contraction  
The Office of the Commissioner and/or the Clubs shall not undertake  
any centralized effort to reduce the number of Major League Clubs  
effective for a season covered by this Agreement; provided, however,  
that nothing in this Article XV(H) shall preclude the owner or owners  
of an individual Club from taking action (e.g., bankruptcy) that would  
result in the elimination of such Club. See Attachment 8.  
I. Sale of Club  
In all instances of the sale, trade, exchange or other change or transfer  
in the ownership of a franchise, all obligations owed to present or for-  
72  
mer Players arising under a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be the  
obligation of the new ownership of such franchise.  
J. Default Notice  
During the term of this Agreement, the right of a Player to terminate  
his Uniform Player’s Contract pursuant to the provisions of the first  
sentence of paragraph 7(a) of such Contract shall be limited to defaults

alleged default filed by a Player under paragraph 7(a) of the Uniform  
Player’s Contract must be filed with the Club (with a copy to the LRD)  
by the Association, in writing, plainly labeled as a default notice.  
Should such a material breach on the part of a Club be alleged, the  
Club, the Player involved, the LRD and the Association will cooperate  
in scheduling the handling of any Grievance brought with respect to  
such alleged breach so that such Grievance may be submitted to arbi-  
tration on an expedited basis.  
K. Interest Rate

(18) tickets each for the All-Star Game, the Wild Card Games, the

Series, which tickets shall not be used for commercial purposes.  
Such tickets will be for seats located between first base and home  
73  
plate or home plate and third base on field level or the first level  
above field level, except the Clubs will not require the holders of  
full regular season ticket plans to be relocated. Six (6) of the eight-  
een tickets made available to the Association for each event shall be  
“preeminent” seats. A “preeminent” seat is a seat that is located in a  
location comparable to the seats that Clubs provide the Office of the  
Commissioner for use as the “Commissioner’s Box.”  
(2) The Office of the Commissioner will review with the Asso-  
ciation the seat locations proposed by the Clubs to comply with their  
obligations under Section (1) above as soon as that information is  
received by the Office of the Commissioner. The Office of the Com-  
missioner will consider in good faith reasonable requests made by  
the Association to change the location of its allotted tickets.  
M. Family and Medical Leave Act  
The Clubs will comply with the requirements of the Family and Med-

(3) Election and Selection Process  
(a) Fans shall elect nine (9) starting position players in the Amer-

each League (the “player selections”), in balloting to be conducted  
by the Office of the Commissioner and Players Association offi-  
cials. The voting shall take place by League only. The balloting shall  
afford all voters with the opportunity to designate five (5) starting  
pitchers, three (3) relief pitchers and two (2) players at each non-  
pitching position, a first choice and a second choice. Voters are per-  
mitted to vote for Players on their own team.  
(c) Promptly following the conclusion of the balloting, the  
Commissioner’s Office shall select in the case of the National  
League seven (7) players (the “additional players”), of whom four  
(4) shall be pitchers. In the case of the American League, the Com-  
missioner’s Office shall select four (4) pitchers and one (1) posi-  
tion player. Final authority for the selection of additional players  
shall reside with the Commissioner’s Office.  
(d) The last position player on each team will be selected in an  
online fan balloting process conducted by MLB.com. The Com-  
missioner’s Office shall select the players to be listed on the online  
ballot.  
(e) Mandatory Participation  
(1) Each player elected or selected to the All-Star team is  
required to attend the All-Star Game as an eligible participant on  
the roster and stay for the duration of the game unless: (A) he is  
on the Disabled List on the Sunday immediately preceding the  
All-Star Game; (B) he does not play in his Club’s final two games  
immediately preceding the All-Star Game due to injury; (C) he is  
a starting pitcher who misses his last scheduled start immediately  
preceding the All-Star Game due to injury; (D) he suffers an  
injury in either of the two games immediately prior to the All-Star  
Game and submits (to both the Office of the Commissioner and  
the Players Association) a certification from his Club physician,  
75  
with supporting medical records, documenting the injury and cer-  
tifying that he is unable to participate in baseball activities, and  
the Office of the Commissioner approves the certification; (E) his  
Club advises him to refrain from baseball activities during the  
All-Star Break to treat a chronic injury or condition and submits  
(to both the Office of the Commissioner and the Players Associ-  
ation) a certification from his Club physician, with supporting  
medical records, documenting the injury and endorsing the  
Club’s recommendation, and the Office of the Commissioner  
approves the Club’s recommendation; (F) he is unable to render  
services on the day of the All-Star Game for reasons that would  
justify his placement on the Major League Bereavement/Family  
Medical Emergency List or the Major League Paternity List; or  
(G) he is ineligible to participate in the All-Star Game under the  
Major League Rules, including, but not limited to, his placement

(11) Any player elected or selected to the All-Star team who is  
not excused from participation by the Office of the Commis-  
sioner must participate in all activities required of All-Stars as  
defined by past practice. In addition, players who participate in  
the All-Star Game must remain in uniform and in the dugout or  
bullpen until the conclusion of the game, unless permission is  
received in advance by the Commissioner’s Office to release the  
player early.  
(f) Substitutions. In the event a player who is a player selection  
does not participate in the All-Star Game pursuant to paragraph 3(e)  
above, the priority of substitution shall be the player balloting,  
except that the Commissioner’s Office will make the selection if the  
top five starting pitchers in the player balloting, the top three relief  
pitchers in the player balloting or the top three position players at the  
position in the player balloting, whichever is applicable, already  
have been named to the team or are unable to participate in the game.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the substitution rules, in  
no event shall a player be named as a replacement in the All-Star  
Game if, at the time he would be selected as a replacement, he is  
unable to play in the All-Star Game. In the event that a player who is  
a fan or Commissioner’s Office selection is unable to play in the All-  
Star Game, the Commissioner’s Office shall select the replacement,  
but the starter at that position shall be a player selection.  
76  
(g) All teams shall be entitled to be represented in the All-Star  
Game. In the event the fan and player balloting does not produce  
such representation, the required representation shall come exclu-  
sively from the additional players. (See subparagraph (c) above)  
(h) In online fan balloting conducted by MLB.com, fans shall be  
afforded the opportunity to participate in the naming of the All-Star  
Game Most Valuable Players (“MVP”’). The player selected by the  
fans shall receive votes not to exceed one-fourth of the number of  
sportswriters casting votes for MVP.  
(4) Emergency Replacements  
In the event that either All-Star team uses its last catcher, and that  
catcher leaves the game due to injury, that team may substitute a  
catcher who has previously appeared in the game. In addition, prior  
to the All-Star Game, each manager will notify the umpire crew  
chief of one player selected pursuant to paragraph 3(c) above who  
has been designated as eligible to return to the game in the event that  
the last position player at any position is injured and must leave the  
game.  
(5) Reserve Pitching Plan  
On the day before the All-Star Game, each manager must meet  
with the Commissioner or his designee to explain his plan for  
reserve pitching should the game extend into extra innings. The plan  
should contemplate up to six (6) extra innings and should designate  
a Starting pitcher who is eligible for extra-innings work. On the day  
before the All-Star Game, the Office of the Commissioner shall pro-  
vide the Players Association with a written description of each man-  
ager’s plan. In managing the All-Star Game, the manager shall  
adhere to the extra innings plan presented to the Commissioner or  
his designee.  
(6) Participant Benefits  
In addition to the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby partici-  
pant benefits described in Article VII(D), all Players on the Active  
Roster (1.e., available to play in the All-Star Game) of the winning  
team shall share equally in a $640,000 bonus.  
77  
(7) Players Trust Benefits  
(a) The Office of the Commissioner shall arrange, as part of the  
presentation of each year’s Home Run Derby, at least one minute or  
longer for a Player interview during the actual broadcast of the  
Derby, the focus of which interview shall be on Trust activities. The  
Player interviewed will also be offered the opportunity to continue  
the discussion during a brief period of the competition. Players  
Association personnel will be available for consultation with the  
broadcaster prior to the interview.  
(b) The Office of the Commissioner shall arrange, as part of the  
presentation of the All-Star Game, a meaningful promotion of the  
Players Trust during the national broadcast of the All-Star Game  
through the broadcast of a promotional highlight of Players Trust  
activities. Players Association personnel will be available for con-  
sultation with the broadcaster prior to the promotion.  
(8) Miking  
A catcher, first baseman, and one or more outfielders playing in  
the All-Star Game will be encouraged by the Players Association to  
wear a microphone on a seven-second delay, in accordance with the  
standards in subparagraphs (a)-(c) below, provided that staff from  
the Players Association shall be exclusively responsible for commu-  
nications with Players in this regard. The Players Association will  
guarantee that a minimum of two Players per All-Star Team will  
wear a microphone. Major League Baseball’s broadcast partner for  
the game also may embed microphones in locations on the field,  
including in or around the bases, for the purpose of capturing ambi-  
ent sounds of the game. On or before seven days prior to the All-Star  
Game, the Players Association shall be provided with a written  
description of where all such on-field microphones will be located.  
(a) Audio from microphones may be telecast only on a  
delayed basis during the telecast. Before audio from a micro-  
phone can be included in the telecast, it must be reviewed and  
approved by an official from the Players Association and the  
Office of the Commissioner, both of whom shall be present in the  
booth/truck.  
(b) The network is not permitted to play back any remarks  
(regardless of the language in which such remarks were spoken)  
78  
or other audio which (i) would embarrass, be prejudicial to,  
detrimental to, or critical of, Major League Baseball, the Play-  
ers Association, the individual wearing the microphone, Players,  
fans or umpires; (11) include any profanity (regardless of  
whether the profanity was bleeped out or otherwise deleted or  
modified with other sounds; or (111) likely would be construed as  
inflammatory.  
(c) Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the network and/or any  
entity authorized by MLB to record audio from microphones shall  
be required to: (1) provide to MLB Properties any and all audio  
from game worn microphones capturing the voice of a Player, or  
containing remarks about a Player, that is not used in the telecast;  
and (11) destroy or permanently delete while on-site all files  
(including back-up or copies of any kind) containing such audio,  
and provide written certification to a senior representative at MLB  
Properties and the Players Association that such destruction or  
deletion has occurred. MLB Properties will not use any unaired  
audio, or authorize others to use any unaired audio, without the  
express written consent of the Players Association.  
O. Special Events  
Up to two series (including a one-game or two-game stand) per  
championship season may be scheduled in the continental United  
States or Canada at a site other than a Major League or Minor League  
ballpark (each a “Special Event’) provided that each of the criteria  
below are met:  
(1) The game is included in the original schedule provided to the  
Players Association on or before July 1 each year.  
(2) The scheduling of the Special Event conforms to all schedul-  
ing provisions of the Basic Agreement, including provisions regard-  
ing game times and getaway days.  
(3) The Office of the Commissioner shall consult with the Play-  
ers Association regarding the start times of the games scheduled for  
each participating Club on the days immediately preceding and  
immediately following the Special Event. The scheduling of such  
Events will take into account the travel obligations that will be  
imposed on the participating Clubs, including but not limited to the  
79  
proximity to an airport, total travel duration and the start times for  
the games immediately before and after the Special Event.  
(4) The Players shall stay in first-class hotels in the metropolitan  
area of the site of the Special Event, to the extent such hotels are  
available, and the Commissioner’s Office will consult with the Play-  
ers Association before a hotel is selected.  
(5) The site of the Special Event shall have a field, dugouts, and  
clubhouses that conform to Major League standards, and the Play-  
ers Association shall have the right to inspect the facilities before  
the game(s), consistent with past practice.  
(6) Except as set forth herein, all costs associated with staging a  
Special Event will be borne by the Commissioner’s Office and not  
paid for using joint funds.  
(7) To the extent practicable, both Clubs shall be provided food,  
facilities, and amenities (including exclusive facilities for training  
and medical treatment, workout facilities, and batting cages) com-  
parable to those provided at a Major League ballpark.  
(8) No Club may be scheduled for a Special Event more than  
once during a season or more than twice during the term of the Basic  
Agreement, absent consent from the Players Association.  
(9) Each Player on the participating Clubs’ Active Roster shall  
receive a one-time stipend of $15,000 (per game), payable from the  
ITF, in addition to the applicable in-season meal and tip allowances.  
(10) The Office of the Commissioner shall make a $100,000  
donation to the Players Trust for each Special Event (payable on or  
before the date of the Special Event).  
(11) At least ninety (90) days before each Special Event, the  
Office of the Commissioner will provide the Players Association  
with its plan to promote the event and related activities, and all pro-  
motional, charitable or commercial activities involving Players in  
connection with the Special Event shall be subject to negotiation  
with the Players Association.  
(12) Each participating Club shall receive a one-time stipend of  
$40,000 (per game), payable from the ITF, to distribute among its  
non-playing personnel who participate in the Special Event (e.g.,  
80  
managers, coaches, and trainers). All Club personnel (other than  
clubhouse staff) are prohibited from directly or indirectly soliciting  
contributions or gratuities (in any form) from Players in connection  
with the Special Event. Violations of this rule will result in a forfei-  
ture of non-player personnel compensation.  
(13) Participating Clubs shall be permitted to add an additional  
position player to the Active Roster. Both Clubs shall return to the  
pre-event number of Active Roster members upon the conclusion of  
the Special Event (see Major League Rule 2(c)(2)(A)(11)(cc)-(gg)).  
(14) The Office of the Commissioner and the Players Associa-  
tion will consult on the making of arrangements in connection with  
a Special Event (e.g., venue, travel, hotel, and hospitality). The Par-  
ties will meet and confer at least twice per month to discuss the stag-  
ing of the Special Event. The Parties will also meet and confer  
within thirty (30) days after each Special Event for the purpose of  
discussing issues that arise and potential changes for future Special  
Events.  
(15) The Office of the Commissioner shall consult with the Play-  
ers Association before hiring any promoter or non-MLB event staff  
in connection with any Special Event; and  
(16) Whenever practicable, the Office of the Commissioner and  
the Players Association will memorialize each Special Event,  
including the players’ involvement with it, through the installation  
of a plaque (or comparable recognition) at the event site.  
ARTICLE XVI—Deferred Compensation  
There shall be no limitations on either the amount of deferred compen-  
sation or the percentage of total compensation attributable to deferred  
compensation for which a Uniform Player’s Contract may provide.  
Deferred compensation obligations incurred in a Contract executed  
after December 31, 1985 but before September 30, 2002 must be fully  
funded by the Club, in an amount equal to the present value of the total  
deferred compensation obligation, on or before the third January | fol-  
lowing the championship season in which the deferred compensation  
is earned. Deferred compensation obligations incurred in a Contract  
executed on or after September 30, 2002 must be fully funded by the  
81  
Club, in an amount equal to the present value of the total deferred com-  
pensation obligation, on or before the second July 1 following the  
championship season in which the deferred compensation is earned.  
For purposes of this Article XVI, full funding of the present value of  
deferred compensation obligations shall mean that the Club must have  
funded, for the duration of and without interruption in each year, the  
current present value of the then outstanding deferred payments, dis-  
counted by 5% annually. If the prime interest rate in effect at The J.P.  
Morgan Chase Bank on the immediately preceding November | is 7%  
or higher, the Parties shall meet and confer regarding this Article XVI  
discount rate and may, with due notice to the Clubs, amend such dis-  
count rate effective the next succeeding July 1.  
Notwithstanding the above funding requirement, each Club shall be  
entitled to an annual deductible amount of deferred compensation  
which need not be funded for Contracts executed before December 11,  
2011. Such deductible amount shall be applied to the aggregate of Uni-  
form Player’s Contracts executed during a given Basic Agreement  
period before December 11, 2011, and shall be in an amount equal to  
the lesser of $2,000,000 or the present value of the total deferred com-  
pensation obligations owed by a Club pursuant to Uniform Player’s  
Contracts executed during a given Basic Agreement period before  
December 11, 2011. The deductible amount applicable to Uniform  
Player’s Contracts signed during a given Basic Agreement period  
before December 11, 2011 is applied against the Club’s current aggre-  
gate deferred compensation funding obligations from Uniform  
Player’s Contracts signed during that Basic Agreement period and not  
any particular Uniform Player’s Contract(s).  
Unless the Uniform Player’s Contract provides otherwise, a Club may  
fund deferred compensation obligations in such manner as it elects,  
provided that: (a) the funding method used by the Club must be such  
that the amount(s) funded are exclusively for the uses and purposes of  
satisfying the deferred compensation obligation(s) being funded; (b)  
the amount(s) funded are maintained in the form of unencumbered  
assets comprising cash or cash equivalents and/or registered and unre-  
stricted readily marketable securities, unless a Club obtains the Parties’  
prior written authorization of an alternative form; and (c) such  
amount(s) funded are subject to the claims of the Club’s general cred-  
itors. Each Club shall certify quarterly to the Office of the Commis-  
82  
sioner by January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31 of each year  
(and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide such certifications  
to the Association within 30 days of their receipt) the manner in which  
its deferred compensation obligations that were required to be funded  
by the immediately preceding July 1 have been funded. In addition,  
upon each quarterly certification, each Club shall provide to the Office  
of the Commissioner all records relating to its deferred compensation  
funding arrangements, and the Office of the Commissioner shall sup-  
ply any such records to the Association upon request.  
ARTICLE XVII—Existing Agreements  
The Parties recognize that there are existing agreements between a  
Major League Club or Clubs and the Players or the Association, and  
between either of the Major Leagues separately and the Players or the  
Association. The Parties reaffirm such agreements and incorporate  
them as part of this Agreement insofar as they are not inconsistent with  
this Agreement. Such agreements shall be considered agreements  
between the Association and the Clubs or any of them for the purpose  
of the Grievance Procedure provided for in Article XI hereof.  
The following three agreements between the Clubs and the Association  
shall not be incorporated as part of this Agreement and shall not be  
affected by the adoption of this Agreement:  
(a) The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan;  
(b) The Agreement re Major League Baseball Players Benefit  
Plan; and  
(c) The Agreement Regarding Dues Check-off.  

### ARTICLE XVIITI—Rule Changes  
### 
If during the term of this Agreement any Major League Rule, or other  
rule or regulation is proposed to be changed, the Clubs agree that they  
shall give the Association notice thereof, and shall negotiate the pro-  
posed change with the Association, provided that the obligation to  
negotiate with the Association provided by this Article XVHI shall  
apply only to (a) a change in a Player benefit under an existing rule or  
regulation and (b) the adoption of a rule or regulation which would  
change a Player benefit under an existing rule or regulation or impose  
83  
an obligation upon the Players which had not previously existed.  
Except as specifically provided in this Article XVIII, the right of the  
Clubs to make any rule change whatsoever shall not be impaired or  
limited in any way, provided that the Clubs shall not make any change  
which is inconsistent with the provisions of any then existing agree-  
ment between the Clubs and the Association.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if during the term of this  
Agreement any playing or scoring rule is proposed to be changed, the  
Clubs agree that they shall give the Association notice thereof, and  
shall negotiate the proposed change with the Association, provided that  
the obligation to negotiate with the Association shall apply only to  
changes which significantly affect terms and conditions of employ-  
ment. Such proposals to change playing or scoring rules shall normally  
be made only during the off-season. If the Clubs and the Association  
fail to reach agreement on a proposed change which is subject to nego-  
tiation, the proposed change shall not be put into effect until the com-  
pletion of the next complete succeeding season (including the Wild  
Card Game, Division Series, League Championship Series and World  
Series) following the date the change was proposed.  
ARTICLE XIX—Assignment of Player Contracts  
A. Consent to Assignment  
(1) The contract of a Player with ten or more years of Major  
League service, the last five of which have been with one Club,  
shall not be assignable to another Major League Club without the  
Player’s written consent. At his sole election, however, a Player  
may, at the time he signs a multi-year contract with a Club, waive  
the right to prevent an assignment of his contract under this Section  
A(1), provided that the multi-year contract (a) is signed before the  
Player has attained ten or more years of Major League service, the  
last five of which have been with one Club, and (b) contains a no  
trade provision that, at a minimum, limits the Club’s right to assign  
the Player’s contract, during each of its years, to no more than six-  
teen (16) Clubs designated or subsequently to be designated by the  
Player.  
(2) (a) The contract of a Player with five or more years of Major  
League service, not including service while on the Military List (or  
84  
seven or more years of Major League service, including service  
while on the Military List), shall not be assigned otherwise than to  
another Major League Club, without the Player’s written consent.  
(b) Not earlier than 4 days prior to the contemplated date of  
an assignment requiring the Player’s consent under subparagraph  
(a) above, or 8 days, if the Player has no options remaining or if  
the assignment is during the period from the close of the  
championship season to the opening of Spring Training, the Club  
shall give written notice to the Player, with a copy to the Associ-  
ation, which shall advise the Player that he may (1) consent to the  
assignment, (11) refuse the assignment or (111) elect to become a  
free agent. Additionally, the notice shall advise that in the event  
that the Player consents to the assignment, he may elect free  
agency between the end of the then current Major League season  
and the next following October 15, unless he is returned to a  
Major League roster prior to making such election.  
The Player shall also be informed in the notice that, within 2  
days after the date of the notice, or 3 days, if during the period  
from the close of the championship season to the opening of  
Spring Training, he must advise the Club in writing as to his deci-  
sion to consent to the assignment or to elect to become a free  
agent. A failure on the part of the Player to respond to the notice  
shall constitute a refusal of the assignment. No response from the  
Player shall be considered effective until twenty-four hours from  
his receipt of the Club’s notice; provided, however, if such elec-  
tion would result in the forfeiture of termination pay, the election  
shall not become effective unless and until the Association con-  
firms the election in writing.  
(c) A Player who elects to become a free agent under this  
paragraph (2), and whose free agency election is confirmed in  
writing by the Association, shall immediately be eligible to nego-  
tiate and contract with any Club without any restrictions or qual-  
ifications and shall not be entitled to receive termination pay.  
Such a free agent shall receive transportation and travel expenses  
in the same manner as he would if he had been unconditionally  
released except that he shall be limited to receiving travel  
expenses to his new club if he reports to it directly, provided such  
expenses are less than to his home city.  
85  
(3) Any Player who has a right to refuse the assignment of his  
contract under paragraph 2(a) above may grant consent to an  
assignment of his contract in advance of any specific contemplated  
assignment if such consent (a) is granted not more than ten (10)  
days prior to the start of the championship season for which the  
consent is given, (b) 1s in writing, (c) designates the assignee Club  
and (d) requires that the assignment take place within 45 days from  
the start of the championship season or the date on which the con-  
sent is granted, whichever is later. The Club shall provide a copy of  
the Player’s consent to the Association contemporaneously upon  
the Club’s receipt of such consent. No Club shall attempt to secure,  
by any Major League terms included in a Minor League Uniform  
Player Contract, an advance consent to an assignment to a Minor  
League club, and any consent so secured shall have no force  
or effect.  
B. Assignment to Minor League club  
When a Player’s contract is assigned from a Major League Club to a  
Minor League club, the rights and benefits of such Player that do, and  
do not, follow him to the Minor Leagues shall be in accordance with  
past practices. Additionally, such a Player shall retain the right, if any,  
to become a free agent, or to require the assignment of his contract,  
which he possessed under his then current Major League contract as  
provided in Article XX hereof, which right shall not be diminished or  
interfered with as a result of such assignment or the signing by the  
Player of a Minor League contract, provided that such right shall ter-  
minate if and when such Player signs a Minor League contract follow-  
ing the time when his free agency rights arise under Article XX.  
C. Disabled List—Assignment to Minor League club  
(1) There shall be no assignment of a Player by a Major League  
Club to a Minor League club while such Player is on a Major  
League Disabled List.  
Players may not be reinstated from the Disabled List for purposes  
of assignment to a Minor League club until they are ready to play.  
Players who are injured and not able to play may not be assigned to  
a Minor League club. However, if a Player who is on optional  
assignment consistent with this provision is assigned to another  
86  
Major League Club, he may be optioned immediately by the  
assignee Club without violating this prohibition, regardless of  
whether the Player is injured and unable to play at the time of the  
assignment.  
Grievances alleging a violation of Article XIX(C)(1) that have  
the potential to affect a Player’s status under Article VI(E), XX(B)  
or XX(D) shall be submitted to arbitration prior to Grievances that  
do not affect the status of Players.  
(2) Notwithstanding Section C(1) above, a Player who is injured  
and not able to play may be assigned to a Minor League club:  
(a) During the period immediately following the close of the  
championship season and before the filing of Major League  
Reserve Lists under Major League Rule 2(a), if:  
(1) the Player’s Major League Uniform Player’s Contract  
does not cover the next succeeding season; and  
(11) the Player, if he otherwise would have been eligible  
for salary arbitration as a “Super Two” Player (see Article  
VI(E)(1)(b)), may elect free agency under the procedures con-  
tained in Article XX(D) in lieu of accepting the assignment;  
provided, however, that a Player who accepts the assignment  
shall not have a right, by virtue of such acceptance, to elect free  
agency following the next succeeding championship season.  
(b) During the period immediately following the filing of  
Major League Reserve Lists and before the 15th day prior to the  
start of the next championship season, if:  
(1) the Player has less than three years of Major League  
Service;  
(11) the contemplated assignment would not be the Player’s  
second (or subsequent) career outright assignment since  
March 19, 1990;  
(111) the Player had no Major League service the prior  
championship season; and  
(iv) the Player was not selected by the assignor Major  
League Club in the immediately preceding Rule 5 Draft.  
87  
(3) Rehabilitation Assignments  
(a) Notwithstanding Section C(1) above, a Player on the Dis-  
abled List may be assigned to a Minor League club for the pur-  
pose of rehabilitation with the Player’s written consent, a copy of  
which shall be forwarded to the Association, and with the  
approval of the Commissioner. See Attachment 39.  
(b) Separate consent shall be required for a rehabilitation  
assignment for a new injury or a reoccurrence of an injury. In  
order for a Player’s written consent to be effective, the duration  
of his rehabilitation assignment must be the product of good faith  
negotiation between the Player and Club. No consent shall be  
effective for longer than twenty days (thirty days for pitchers).  
(c) A Player on the Disabled List may be assigned to a Minor  
League club for up to a maximum of twenty days (thirty days for  
pitchers) for each injury, or reoccurrence of an injury, for the pur-  
pose of rehabilitation. However, a Player may provide more than  
one consent for the same injury, or a reoccurrence of an injury, if  
the total number of days of the rehabilitation assignment for that  
injury or reoccurrence does not exceed a maximum of twenty  
days (thirty days for pitchers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  
Player rehabbing from UCL reconstruction surgery may consent  
to up to three consecutive ten-day extensions of his rehabilitation  
assignment, with the approval of the Commissioner’s Office and  
the Association.  
(d) Any service with a Minor League club while on rehabili-  
tation assignment shall be deemed to be Major League service as  
defined in Article XXI. A Player so assigned shall continue to  
receive his Major League salary and the other rights and benefits  
of such Player shall be in accordance with past practices relating  
to assignments to Minor League clubs; provided, however, that  
all such players shall be treated as if they were Major League  
Players on the road for purposes of hotel accommodations and  
the daily meal and tip allowance. Such assignment shall not be  
counted as an optional assignment under Major League Rule 11  
or for any other purpose, and waivers shall not be required.  
88  
D. Foreign Assignments  
Except for the return of conditional assignments from outside the  
United States and Canada, the contract of a Player shall not be assigned  
otherwise than within the United States and Canada, without the  
Player’s written consent.  
E. Optional Assignments  
If a Player is optionally assigned for a total of less than 20 days in one  
championship season, such optional assignment(s) shall not count as  
an optional assignment in connection with the limitation upon optional  
assignments provided for in Major League Rule I1(c). See Article  
XXI(B).  
For purposes of counting days on option, the date of the optional  
assignment shall be counted and the date of recall shall not be counted,  
provided that the date of the optional assignment shall not be counted  
if the assignment takes place after the start of a Major League game in  
which the Player otherwise would have been eligible to play, and the  
date of recall shall be counted if the recall takes place after the start of  
any Minor League game in which the Player was eligible to play.  
F. Waivers  
Any assignment of a Player contract must conform to the rules regard-  
ing waivers contained in Major League Rule 10.  
In addition, each Friday, not later than 3 P.M. Eastern Time, the Office  
of the Commissioner shall notify the Association of all waiver requests  
and their disposition. Notification shall include:  
(1) the date on which the waiver request was made;  
(2) the date of expiration of the waiver period;  
(3) if the waiver period has expired, whether or not claims were  
filed;  
(4) if claims are not filed, the period for which waivers have  
been granted; and  
(5) if claims were filed, whether or not the Club requesting  
waivers has withdrawn its request. In the event claims were filed and  
89  
the Club requesting waivers has withdrawn its request, the Office of  
the Commissioner need not identify the claiming Club or Clubs.  
G. Designated Player  
A Player who is in the status of a “designated player” under Major  
League Rule 2(k) shall, during the period he is in such status, be  
(1) paid at the rate of his Major League salary and  
(2) credited with Major League service.  
A Player who is in the status of a “designated player” under Major  
League Rule 2(k) shall be unconditionally released or his contract  
assigned within 7 days after he is placed in the status. A Club must  
request the necessary waivers in a time frame that will allow it to  
unconditionally release or assign the player within the 7-day period.  
The days between and including Christmas Day and New Year’s Day  
shall not count toward the 7-day limit.  
H. Unconditional Release  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Major League Rule 8 and paragraph  
7(d) of the Uniform Player’s Contract, the following procedure may be  
used to give notice to a Player in connection with his unconditional  
release.  
At the same time the Club advises a Player in writing that the Club  
has requested waivers for the purpose of unconditional release, and  
the date on which the waiver request will expire, the Player shall  
advise the Club in writing of the address and telephone number to  
which the Club should telephone or send written notice of termination  
to the Player upon the expiration of the waiver period. If the Player  
fails to supply a telephone number or address, the Club may use the  
most recent address or telephone number the Player has supplied the  
Club.  
Upon the expiration of the waiver period, the Club shall either give tele-  
phone or written notice of termination to the Player. In addition, the  
Player may call the Club to determine whether his contract has been  
claimed.  
90  
I. Forms  
In any case in which a Player’s consent must be secured prior to the  
assignment of his contract (see Article Article  
Article XIX(A)(3) and Article XIX(C)(3)) or in which a Player may  
elect free agency in lieu of accepting the outright assignment of his  
contract (see Article XX(D)(1) and (2)), the form given to the Player  
must include the Player’s name in typewritten form.  
ARTICLE XX—Reserve System  
A. Reservation Rights of Clubs  
Subject to the rights of Players as set forth in this Agreement, each  
Club may have title to and reserve up to 40 Player contracts. A Club  
shall retain title to a contract and reservation rights until one of the fol-  
lowing occurs:  
(1) The Player becomes a free agent, as set forth in this Agree-  
ment;  
(2) The Player becomes a free agent as a result of  
(a) termination of the contract by the Club pursuant to para-  
graph 7(b) thereof,  
(b) termination of the contract by the Player pursuant to para-  
graph 7(a) thereof,  
(c) failure by the Office of the Commissioner to convey to the  
Player, by Central Tender Letter submitted to the Association, the  
Club’s tender of a new contract within the time period specified  
in paragraph 10(a) of the contract (see Attachment 9), or  
(d) failure by the Club to exercise its right to renew the con-  
tract within the time period specified in paragraph 10(a) thereof;  
or  
(3) The contract is assigned outright by the Club.  
On or before 8 P.M. Eastern Time on December 2 (or, if December 2  
is a Saturday or Sunday, then on or before the preceding business day)  
the Office of the Commissioner shall satisfy the Clubs’ tender obliga-  
tions pursuant to paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract by  
91  
submitting to the Association a letter listing, by Club, the Players to  
whom each Club is tendering a contract for the term of the next year  
(“Central Tender The Central Tender Letter shall, consistent  
with Article VI(A) and Article VI(B), include for each Player so ten-  
dered the salary or salaries, performance bonuses and/or other terms,  
if any, offered by the Club. The Central Tender Letter also shall sepa-  
rately list, also by Club, those players who have not been tendered a  
contract for the term of the next year. The Office of the Commis-  
sioner, at the time it transmits the Central Tender Letter, shall provide  
to the Association addresses for all Players who had been promoted to  
the Major League roster for the first time in the preceding November  
and for those Players who do not have a certified Player Agent. See  
Attachment 9.  
Any inadvertent error in the tendering or renewal of a contract, includ-  
ing but not limited to an untimely tender or renewal, shall result in free  
agency under paragraph (2)(c) or (2)(d) above, whichever is applica-  
ble, only if the Player has first given the Club written notice that the  
tendered or renewed Contract does not conform to the requirements of  
Article VI of this Agreement and the Club has not retendered or re-  
exercised a renewal in conformance with all applicable rules within  
seven (7) days after receipt by the Club of written notice of such  
defect.  
A Club may also reserve, under separate headings on a Reserve List,  
Players who properly have been placed on the Voluntarily Retired List,  
the Military List, the Suspended List, the Restricted List, the Disqual-  
ified List or the Ineligible List. See Attachments 10, 11 and 12.  
B. Free Agency  
(1) Eligibility  
Following the completion of the term of his Uniform Player’s  
Contract, any Player with 6 or more years of Major League service  
who has not executed a contract for the next succeeding season shall  
become a free agent, subject to and in accordance with the provi-  
sions of this Section B.  
(2) Procedure  
The procedure set forth in this paragraph (2) shall apply to Play-  
ers who become free agents pursuant to paragraph (1) above. Play-  
92  
ers who otherwise become free agents under this Agreement shall be  
eligible to negotiate and contract with any Club without any restric-  
tions or qualifications.  
(a) A Player eligible to become a free agent under paragraph  
(1) shall become a free agent as of 9 A.M. Eastern Time on the  
day following the day that the last game of the World Series had  
started.  
(b) During the period beginning at the time when the Player  
becomes a free agent as defined in subparagraph (a) above and  
ending at 5 P.M. Eastern Time on the fifth day following the day  
that the last game of the World Series had started (“Quiet  
Period’’), any Club representative and any free agent or his repre-  
sentative may talk with each other and discuss the merits of the  
free agent contracting, when eligible therefor, with the Club; pro-  
vided, however, that the Club and the free agent shall not negoti-  
ate terms or contract with each other. The following subjects are  
among those which may properly be discussed between any Club  
and such Player:  
(i) the Player’s interest in playing for the Club, and the  
Club’s interest in having the Player play for it;  
(11) the Club’s plans about how it intends to utilize the  
Player’s services (as a starting pitcher or reliever, as a desig-  
nated hitter or not, platooning, etc.);  
(111) the advantages and disadvantages of playing for the  
Club including the nature of the organization, the climate of  
the city, availability of suitable housing, etc.;  
(iv) length of contract;  
(v) guarantee provisions; and  
(vi) no-trade or limited no-trade provisions.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the free agent and his former  
Club may engage in negotiations and enter into a contract during  
the Quiet Period.  
(c) Players who become free agents pursuant to this Section B  
shall, upon the expiration of the Quiet Period, be eligible to nego-  
93  
tiate and contract with any Club, subject to the provisions of this  
Section B.  
(3) Rights of Former Club  
The following provision shall apply only to each Player who  
becomes a free agent under this Section B after having been contin-  
uously under reserve (without interruption) to the same Club (either  
at the Major or Minor League level) since Opening Day of the  
recently completed championship season and who has never previ-  
ously received a Qualifying Offer (defined below) from any Club  
(“Qualified Free Agent’).  
During the Quiet Period, the former Club of a Qualified Free  
Agent may tender the Qualified Free Agent a one-year Uniform  
Player’s Contract for the next succeeding season with a guaranteed  
salary that is equal to the average salary of the 125 highest-paid  
Players each year (“Qualifying Offer’). The amount of the Quali-  
fying Offer each year shall be determined pursuant to Attachment  
45 to this Agreement, and shall be communicated to Clubs and  
Players by the Parties within ten (10) days of the conclusion of the  
championship season. Clubs shall inform the LRD of the Office of  
the Commissioner whether they will make a Qualifying Offer to a  
Qualified Free Agent, and the LRD will inform the Players Associ-  
ation no later than 5 P.M. Eastern Time on the last day of the Quiet  
Period of each Club’s Qualifying Offers to Qualified Free Agents.  
If the former Club of a Qualified Free Agent does not tender him a  
Qualifying Offer, it shall not be entitled to compensation under  
paragraph (4) of this Section B with respect to that Qualified Free  
Agent.  
A Qualified Free Agent may accept a Qualifying Offer until the  
tenth day following the conclusion of the Quiet Period (“Accep-  
tance Period’’). The Players Association shall provide the LRD with  
a list of the Qualified Free Agents who have accepted the Qualify-  
ing Offer by 5 P.M. Eastern Time of the final day of the Acceptance  
Period. Any Qualified Free Agent whose name is not included on  
the list provided by the Players Association to the LRD will be  
deemed to have rejected the Qualifying Offer.  
If the Player accepts the Qualifying Offer, he shall be a signed  
player for the next season on a one-year contract with a salary equal  
94  
to the amount of the Qualifying Offer, and shall be eligible for in-  
season termination pay as set forth in Article IX, Section C if his  
Contract 1s terminated under paragraph 7(b)(2) of the Uniform  
Player’s Contract from the date of acceptance through the conclu-  
sion of the championship season.  
(4) Compensation  
(a) A Qualified Free Agent shall be subject to compensation only  
if: (1) his former Club tenders him a Qualifying Offer pursuant to  
paragraph (3) of this Section B; (11) the Player declines the Qualify-  
ing Offer or signs a contract with another Major League Club prior  
to the expiration of the Acceptance Period; and (111) the Player signs  
a Major League contract with another Major League Club that is  
confirmed by the Players Association and the LRD on or before the  
day prior to the next succeeding Major League Rule 4 Draft (“Rule  
4 Draft’). A Qualified Free Agent who signs a bona fide Minor  
League contract shall not be subject to compensation irrespective of  
whether the Minor League contract is subsequently assigned to the  
Major League Club. No Club and Player may enter into any Major  
League or Minor League contract, or assign such a contract, with  
the intent to circumvent Article XX(B)(3) or XX(B)(4).  
(b) Former Club. The former Club of a Qualified Free Agent  
subject to compensation (“Former Club’’) shall receive an amateur  
draft choice (“Special Draft Choice’) immediately following the  
last selection in Competitive Balance Round B of the next Rule 4  
Draft. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Former Club that was a  
Revenue Sharing Payee (as defined in Article XXIV) and not mar-  
ket disqualified in the Revenue Sharing Year that encompasses the  
most recently completed championship season shall receive a  
Special Draft Choice immediately following the last selection in the  
first round of the next Rule 4 Draft if its Qualified Free Agent sub-  
ject to compensation enters into a contract with another Club with a  
total guarantee of $50 million or more; and (11) a Former Club that  
was a CBT Payor in the Contract Year that encompasses the most  
recently completed championship season (regardless of the Former  
Club’s status under the Revenue Sharing Plan) shall receive a  
Special Draft Choice immediately following the last selection in the  
fourth round of the next Rule 4 Draft. For purposes of the previous  
sentence, the “total guarantee” of a contract signed by a Qualified  
95  
Free Agent shall include the following: (a) total salary in any guar-  
anteed contract years (including any Player option years); (b) any  
signing bonus (regardless of when paid); (c) any buyout associated  
with the first Club or mutual option year; and (d) any performance,  
roster, or award bonuses, escalators, or vesting options, but only to  
the extent the Player would have earned those bonuses, escalators,  
or vesting options based on his performance in any prior season of  
his career. For the purposes of (a)-(d) above the value of any com-  
pensation payable pursuant to such a contract after the last  
championship season covered by the contract shall be calculated in  
accordance with Article XXIII(E)(6) (“Deferred Compensation’’). If  
multiple Clubs that have lost Qualified Free Agents subject to com-  
pensation receive a Special Draft Choice after the same round of the  
next Rule 4 Draft, those Special Draft Choices will be sequenced in  
the reverse order of the recipient Clubs’ won-lost percentage in the  
most recently completed season. If a Club is entitled to more than  
one Special Draft Choice after the same round of the next Rule 4  
Draft, its selections will be slotted in succession. If two or more  
Clubs had an identical won-lost percentage in the most recently  
completed season, the Clubs shall select in the reverse order of their  
winning percentages in the season prior to the most recently com-  
pleted season, with any remaining ties to be resolved based on pre-  
ceding season winning percentages.  
(c) Signing Club  
(i) As set forth below, for each Qualified Free Agent subject  
to compensation whom it signs, the signing Club (“Signing  
Club’’) shall have its Signing Bonus Pool in the next international  
signing period (as described in Attachment 46) reduced and/or  
forfeit one or more selections in the next Rule 4 Draft, as follows:  
(A) If the Signing Club was a Revenue Sharing Payee (as  
defined in Article XXIV) and not market disqualified in the  
Revenue Sharing Year that encompasses the most recently  
completed championship season, it shall forfeit its third-high-  
est available selection in the next Rule 4 Draft.  
(B) Notwithstanding subsection (A) above, if the Signing  
Club was a CBT Payor in the Contract Year (as defined in  
Article XXIII) that encompasses the most recently completed  
96  
championship season, it shall forfeit its second-highest and  
fifth-highest available selections in the next Rule 4 Draft, and  
it shall have its international Signing Bonus Pool for the next  
international signing period reduced by $1 million.  
(C) Any Signing Club not covered by subsections (A) or  
(B) above shall forfeit its second-highest available selection in  
the next Rule 4 Draft and shall have its international Signing  
Bonus Pool for the next international signing period reduced  
by $500,000.  
(11) Draft selections shall be awarded and forfeited pursuant to  
subsections 4(b) and 4(c), respectively, as of the date the last  
Qualified Free Agent subject to compensation enters into a con-  
tract that is confirmed by the Players Association and the LRD,  
or the day prior to the next Rule 4 Draft, whichever occurs first.  
The draft selections forfeited by a Signing Club in the next Rule  
4 Draft shall be determined as follows.  
(A) Determining a Club’s Highest Available Draft Selec-  
tions. With the exception of draft selections forfeited by the  
Club pursuant to Major League Rule 3(c)(4)(B), all of a Club’s  
draft selections will be counted in determining the Club’s sec-  
ond-highest, third-highest or fifth-highest available selections,  
including compensatory selections awarded pursuant to sub-  
section 4(b) above and selections awarded pursuant to Major  
League Rules 4(c)(2), 4(k)(1) or 4(k)(2) (or acquired via an  
assignment).  
(B) Draft Selections Subject to Forfeiture. With the excep-  
tion of draft selections awarded to a Club pursuant to Major  
League Rule 4(c)(2) or 4(k)(2), all of a Club’s selections will  
be subject to forfeiture pursuant to subsection 4(c)(1) above,  
including selections awarded pursuant to subsection 4(b)  
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Competitive Balance  
Selections obtained through an assignment from another Club  
will be subject to forfeiture. If a Club’s second-highest, third-  
highest or fifth-highest selection is a selection exempt from  
forfeiture under this section, the Club shall forfeit its next  
highest available selection.  
97  
(C) Clubs That Sign More Than One Qualified Free Agent.  
If a Club’s second-highest, third-highest or fifth-highest selec-  
tion is no longer available because it was forfeited pursuant to  
subsection 4(c)(1) as a result of signing another Qualified Free  
Agent, the Signing Club shall forfeit its next highest available  
selection. By way of example, if a Club forfeited its second-  
round selection and fifth-round selection for signing its first  
Qualified Free Agent pursuant to subsection 4(c)(1)(B) above,  
it shall forfeit 1ts third-round selection and sixth-round selec-  
tion for signing its next Qualified Free Agent (assuming those  
are its next highest selections not exempt from forfeiture).  
International Signing Bonus Pool amounts forfeited pur-  
suant to this subsection (4)(c) shall be reallocated equally among  
the international Signing Bonus Pools among Clubs that did not  
forfeit Pool space pursuant to this Section. If the amount of Sign-  
ing Bonus Pool space that a Club forfeits pursuant to subsection  
4(c)(1) above exceeds the Club’s available Signing Bonus Pool  
space in the next international signing period, the remaining for-  
feited amount shall be deducted from the Club’s Signing Bonus  
Pool in each subsequent international signing period until the full  
amount has been deducted.  
(iv) For purposes of subsection 4(b) above and this subsection  
4(c), the Oakland Athletics shall be considered market disquali-  
fied beginning with the off-season following the 2020 season.  
(5) Miscellaneous  
(a) Any Club signing a contract with a Player under this Article  
XX(B) after the expiration of the Quiet Period described in subsec-  
tion 2(b) above may not assign his contract until after the next June  
15. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, such contract may be  
assigned for other Player contracts and/or cash consideration of  
$50,000 or less prior to the next June 16 if the Player gives written  
consent to such transaction.  
(b) There shall be no restriction or interference with the right of  
a free agent to negotiate or contract with any baseball club outside  
the structure of organized baseball, nor shall there be any compen-  
sation paid for the loss of a free agent except as provided for in this  
Article XX(B).  
98  
(c) A Club and Player (or their designated representatives) shall  
not enter into any agreement, understanding or contract, or make  
any representation, promise or commitment, whether implied or  
explicit, either orally or in writing, that the Club will not make a  
Qualifying Offer to a Player, or that a Player will not accept a Qual-  
ifying Offer if one is tendered to him. Any Club or Club employee  
that violates this provision will be subject to discipline by the Com-  
missioner, including the potential forfeiture of draft selections.  
(d) Retention Bonus  
(1) If a Club signs a Player who became a free agent pursuant  
to this Article XX(B) to a Minor League Uniform Player Contract  
between the date the Player became a free agent as set forth in  
subsection B(2)(a) above and ten days prior to the commence-  
ment of the next succeeding championship season, the Club shall  
pay the Player a retention bonus of $100,000 if, by 12 P.M. East-  
ern Time on the fifth day prior to the first day of the champion-  
ship season, (1) the Club does not agree in writing to add the  
Player to its Opening Day 25-man roster or Major League Dis-  
abled List at the commencement of the championship season, or  
(11) the Club does not provide the Player with his immediate  
unconditional release.  
(11) If a Club agrees to add a Player to its Opening Day 25-  
man roster or Major League Disabled List at the commencement  
of the championship season pursuant to subsection (d)(i) above,  
the Club must notify the LRD of its decision either to add the  
Player to its Opening Day 25-man roster or Major League Dis-  
abled List no later than 12 P.M. Eastern Time on the fifth day  
prior to the first day of the championship season, and the LRD  
will inform the Players Association.  
(111) The $100,000 retention bonus described in subsection  
(d)(1) above must be paid on or before April 15 of the next suc-  
ceeding championship season. Such bonus shall not be subject to  
the non-duplication provision contained in Article IX(F) of this  
Agreement.  
(iv) Ifa Club elects to retain a Player under his Minor League  
Uniform Player Contract pursuant to subparagraph (1) above by  
paying the $100,000 retention bonus, the Player may require the  
99  
Club to provide him with his unconditional release on June 1 if  
he had not been added to the Club’s 25-man roster or placed on  
the Major League Disabled List at any time prior to June 1. The  
Player must notify the Club in writing no later than 2 P.M. East-  
ern Time on May 28 that he is requesting his unconditional  
release by 2 P.M. Eastern Time on June | if the Club does not  
add him to its 25-man roster or Major League Disabled List by  
that time.  
(v) A Club and Player may agree to a special covenant to a  
Minor League Uniform Player Contract for a Player covered by  
this subsection (5)(d) that provides the Player with a retention  
bonus greater than $100,000, an earlier deadline for adding the  
Player to its Opening Day 25-man roster or Major League Dis-  
abled List, an advanced payment schedule for the bonus, or an  
earlier date by which the Player may require the Club to provide  
him with his unconditional release. Nothing contained herein is  
intended to modify any other provision contained under this  
Agreement or the Major League Rules with respect to permissible  
special covenants in a Minor League Uniform Player Contract.  
(vi) This subsection (5)(d) shall apply to Players who became  
free agents pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article  
XX(B)(1) and (2) above, and shall not apply to Players who  
became free agents pursuant to any other provision of the Basic  
Agreement or a special covenant to a Major League Uniform  
Player’s Contract.  
(ec) The exercise dates of option provisions contained in Uniform  
Player’s Contracts all must fall within the Quiet Period described in  
subparagraph (2)(b) above.  
C. [Reserved]  
D. Outright Assignment to Minor League Club  
(1) Election of Free Agency—3-Year Player  
Any Player who has at least 3 years of Major League service, or  
who qualified as a “Super Two” Player under Article VI(E)(1)(b) as  
of the conclusion of the prior championship season, and whose con-  
tract is assigned outright to a Minor League club may elect, in lieu of  
100  
accepting such assignment, to become a free agent. In the event that  
such a Player with at least 3 years of Major League service does not  
elect free agency in lieu of accepting such assignment, he may elect  
free agency between the end of the then current Major League sea-  
son and the next following October 15, unless such Player is returned  
to a Major League roster prior to making such election. Any Player  
who accepts an outright assignment as a “Super Two” Player will not  
retain a right to elect free agency following the season.  
(2) Election of Free Agency—Second Outright Assignment  
Any Player whose contract is assigned outright to a Minor  
League club for the second time or any subsequent time in his career  
may elect, in lieu of accepting such assignment, to become a free  
agent. In the event that such Player does not elect free agency in lieu  
of accepting such assignment, he may elect free agency between the  
end of the then current Major League season and the next following  
October 15, unless such Player is returned to a Major League roster  
prior to making such election.  
(3) Effect of Free Agency Election  
A Player who becomes a free agent under this Article XX(D)  
shall immediately be eligible to negotiate and contract with any  
Club without any restrictions or qualifications, and shall not be enti-  
tled to receive termination pay; provided, however, if such election  
would result in the forfeiture of termination pay, the election shall  
not become effective unless and until the Association confirms the  
election in writing. Such a free agent shall receive transportation  
and travel expenses in the same manner as he would if he had been  
unconditionally released except he shall be limited to receiving  
travel expenses to his new club if he reports to it directly, provided  
such expenses are less than to his home city.  
(4) Procedure  
Not earlier than 4 days prior to the contemplated date of an out-  
right assignment, or 8 days, if the Player has no options remaining  
or if the assignment is during the period from the close of the  
championship season to the opening of Spring Training, the Club  
shall give written notice to the Player, with a copy to the Associa-  
101  
tion, which shall advise the Player that he may either (a) accept the  
assignment or (b) elect to become a free agent, and that in the event  
he accepts the assignment, he may (except in the case of a “Super  
Two” Player who accepts a first outright assignment) elect free  
agency between the end of the then current Major League season  
and the next following October 15, unless he is returned to a Major  
League roster prior to making such election. The Player shall also  
be informed in the notice that, within 2 days after the date of the  
notice, or 3 days, if during the period from the close of the  
championship season to the opening of Spring Training, he must  
advise the Club in writing as to his decision whether to accept the  
assignment. No such decision from a Player shall be considered  
effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the Club’s  
notice. If the Club fails to give written notice, as set forth herein, to  
the Player prior to the date of such assignment, the Player may, at  
any time, elect to become a free agent pursuant to this Article  
XX(D); provided, however, that if the Club subsequently gives  
such written notice to the Player, he shall, within 3 days thereafter,  
or 10 days, if during the period from the close of the championship  
season to the opening of Spring Training, advise the Club in writ-  
ing as to his decision. No such decision from a Player shall be con-  
sidered effective until twenty-four hours from his receipt of the  
Club’s notice.  
E. Individual Nature of Rights  
(1) The utilization or non-utilization of rights under Article  
XIX(A)(2) and Article XX is an individual matter to be determined  
solely by each Player and each Club for his or its own benefit. Play-  
ers shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act  
in concert with other Clubs.  
(2) Upon any finding of a violation of Section E(1) of this Arti-  
cle XX by two or more Clubs, any injured Player (or Players) shall  
be entitled to recover in monetary damages three (3) times the lost  
baseball income, he (or they) would have had but for the violation.  
Such lost baseball income shall be limited to lost salary and other  
lost contractual terms, including lost additional contract years, lost  
signing bonuses, lost trade restriction provisions, lost option buyout  
provisions, and lost incentive bonuses (e.g., performance, awards,  
102  
attendance and weight bonuses). Damages (and fees and interest)  
may be recovered only from the Clubs found to have violated Sec-  
tion E(1) of this Article XX.  
(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Basic Agree-  
ment, the Arbitration Panel shall further order payment by the Clubs  
found to have violated Section E(1) of this Article XX of all reason-  
able attorneys’ fees and expenses, expert witness fees and expenses  
and prejudgment interest on the single damage calculation of the  
lost baseball income pursuant to paragraph (2).  
(4) Any injured Player (or Players or the Association) shall not  
be entitled to recover any monetary damages pursuant to this  
Article XX(E) other than those enumerated in paragraphs (2) and  
(3). However, nothing in paragraphs (2) and (3) is intended to reflect  
any agreement between the Parties on mitigation issues.  
(5) In addition, upon any finding by the Arbitration Panel of a  
violation by five (5) Clubs or more of Section E(1) of this Article  
XX, the Association shall have the right to reopen this Agreement  
upon sixty (60) days written notice to the LRD.  
(6) Upon any finding by the Arbitration Panel of a violation of  
Section E(1) of this Article XX by two (2) or more Clubs, any  
injured free agent Player will have the right to terminate his exist-  
ing contract (or reserve status) at his option immediately following  
the issuance of the finding by the Arbitration Panel. However, no  
such termination shall take effect during the period beginning on  
February 15 and ending with the conclusion of the World Series. If  
the finding of the Arbitration Panel is issued at any time on or after  
January 15, but before February 15, the Player shall have the right  
to terminate his existing contract (or reserve status) at his option  
either (a) immediately; or (b) within the fifteen (15) day period fol-  
lowing the conclusion of the next succeeding World Series. At the  
time any contract (or reserve status) is terminated pursuant to this  
paragraph (6), such free agent Player shall immediately have the  
right to negotiate with and enter into a contract with any Club, with-  
out any restrictions or qualifications. If the contract (or reserve sta-  
tus) is terminated, the free agent Player may choose to reinstate his  
contract (or reserve status) at any time up until the March 15 suc-  
ceeding such termination.  
103  
(7) If a Player does not exercise his right pursuant to paragraph  
(6) to reinstate his contract (or reserve status), all obligations of the  
Player and of the Club under said contract (or reserve status) shall  
cease as of the end of the period in which the Player has the right to  
reinstate his contract (or reserve status), except the obligation of the  
Club to pay the Player’s compensation to that date. If at the end of  
the period the Player has not signed a new contract and has not exer-  
cised his right to reinstate his existing contract (or reserve status), at  
that point, the Player shall be considered an unrestricted free agent.  
(8) Utilization or non-utilization of the procedures set forth in  
paragraph (6) above shall be without prejudice to any injured free  
agent Player. However, the experience of each Player who utilizes  
such procedures shall be considered by the Arbitration Panel in  
determining such further relief, if any, to which he may be entitled.  
(9) It is understood that in the event of a violation of Section  
E(1) of this Article XX, the Arbitration Panel shall have the author-  
ity to order such other and further non-monetary (e.g., injunctive)  
relief as may be necessary to give full force and effect to the pur-  
poses of and to the rights and benefits afforded to Players under this  
Article XX.  

### ARTICLE XXI—Credited Major League Service  
### A. Definitions  
### 
Those Player rights expressly set forth in the Basic Agreement for  
which a Player’s eligibility is dependent upon credited Major League  
service will be determined as follows:  
(1) One full day of Major League service will be credited for  
each day of the championship season a Player is on a Major League  
Club’s Active List. A total of 172 days of Major League credited  
service will constitute one full year of credited service. A Player  
may not be credited with more than one year of credited service, 172  
days, in one championship season (including any tie-breaker  
games). Major League service will be computed commencing with  
the date of the first regularly scheduled championship season game,  
through and including the date of the last regularly scheduled  
championship season game; provided, however, that one full day of  
Major League service shall also be credited for any tiebreaker game  
104  
played following the conclusion of the last regularly scheduled  
championship season game but before the commencement of post-  
season play pursuant to Major League Rule 33(c) (subject to the  
maximum of 172 service days in any season). This rule shall apply  
uniformly to all Players and all Clubs notwithstanding differences in  
a particular Club’s schedule.  
(2) For purposes of calculating credited service, a Player will be  
considered to be on a Club’s Active List if:  
(a) placed on a disciplinary suspension by a Club, the Chief  
Baseball Officer or the Commissioner, or on the Disabled List; or  
(b) called to active military duty for up to two years or if called  
to emergency duty by the National Guard for a period of up to  
thirty days.  
B. Optional Assignments  
If a Player is optionally assigned for a total of less than 20 days in one  
championship season, the Player shall be credited with Major League  
service during the period of such optional assignment(s); provided,  
however, that a Player shall not be credited with Major League service  
under this provision if the Player had zero days of Major League serv-  
ice in the current season prior to the optional assignment and after the  
optional assignment was unconditionally released or assigned outright  
and not subsequently added to the Active List for the remainder of the  
championship season. See Article XIX(E).  
For purposes of counting days on option, the date of the optional  
assignment shall be counted and the date of recall shall not be counted,  
provided that the date of the optional assignment shall not be counted  
if the assignment takes place after the start of a Major League game in  
which the Player otherwise would have been eligible to play, and the  
date of recall shall be counted if the recall takes place after the start of  
any Minor League game in which the Player was eligible to play. See  
Attachment 32.  
ARTICLE XXII—Management Rights  
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict the rights of  
the Clubs to manage and direct their operations in any manner whatso-  
ever except as specifically limited by the terms of this Agreement.  
105  
ARTICLE XXIII—Competitive Balance Tax  
A. General Definitions  
The following definitions shall apply only to this Article XXIII, unless  
expressly adopted for use in another Article of this Agreement.  
(1) “Contract Year” shall mean the period from December 2 of  
one year through and including December 1 of the following year,  
or such other one-year period to which the Office of the Commis-  
sioner and the Association may agree. To the extent that a Contract  
Year is referenced by a number in connection with a particular cal-  
culation, the reference shall be to the calendar year of the champion-  
ship season that falls in that Contract Year.  
(2) “Uniform Player’s Contract” shall mean a Major League  
Uniform Player’s Contract. (See Appendix A.)  
(3) “Split Contract” shall mean a Uniform Player’s Contract  
which sets out separate rates of pay for service with a Minor League  
club and service with a Major League Club.  
(4) “Imputed Loan Interest Rate” for each Contract Year shall  
mean the annual “Federal mid-term rate” as defined in Section  
1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the October preceding  
that Contract Year.  
(5) “Performance Bonus” shall mean a payment to a Player con-  
ditioned upon the Player having achieved certain specified levels of  
activity, provided that such bonuses must be consistent with Major  
League Rule 3(b).  
(6) “Award Bonus” shall mean a payment to a Player condi-  
tioned upon the Player having achieved a particular status in con-  
nection with a recognized or agreed-upon award or honor.  
(7) “Base Salary” shall mean the amount set out in paragraph 2  
of a Uniform Player’s Contract for a given championship season or  
any amount included in a Special Covenant in lieu of inclusion in  
paragraph 2.  
(8) “Guaranteed Year” shall mean any championship season  
included in a Uniform Player’s Contract for which more than 50%  
of the Player’s Base Salary is guaranteed by the Contract in the  
event of termination under paragraph 7(b)(2).  
106  
(9) “Base Tax Threshold” shall be defined as provided in Section  
B below.  
(10) “Surcharge Thresholds” shall be defined as provided in Sec-  
tion B below.  
(11) “Actual Club Payroll” shall be defined as provided in Sec-  
tion C below. Each Club’s final Actual Club Payroll for a Contract  
Year in which the Competitive Balance Tax is applicable shall be  
calculated on the December 2 following that Contract Year and shall  
be the exclusive figure used for the purpose of determining whether  
a Club has exceeded the Base Tax or Surcharge Thresholds.  
(12) “Salary” shall be defined as provided in Section E below  
and shall be attributable to Contract Years as provided in Sections C  
and E below.  
(13) “Benefits” or “Player Benefit Costs” shall be defined as  
provided in Section D below.  
B. Determination of Competitive Balance Tax  
(1) Calculation of Tax  
A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds the Base Tax  
Threshold applicable in that Contract Year (“Tax Threshold” or  
“Base Tax shall be assessed a Competitive Balance Tax  
on the difference between its final Actual Club Payroll and the Base  
Tax Threshold. In addition, a Club with an Actual Club Payroll that  
exceeds one or both of the Surcharge Thresholds shall be assessed  
an additional Competitive Balance Tax as described below. A Club  
with an Actual Club Payroll at or below the Base Tax Threshold  
shall incur no Competitive Balance Tax for that Contract Year.  
(2) Base Tax Thresholds  
The Base Tax Threshold shall be $195 million in the 2017 Con-  
tract Year, $197 million in the 2018 Contract Year, $206 million in  
the 2019 Contract Year, $208 million in the 2020 Contract Year, and  
$210 million in the 2021 Contract Year.  
(3) Base Tax Rates  
The Base Competitive Balance Tax rates are provided below.  
107  
(a) For a Club that has an Actual Club Payroll above the Base  
Tax Threshold in any Contract Year, the applicable Competitive  
Balance Tax rate shall be:  
(1) 20% if the Club did not exceed the Base Tax Threshold  
in the preceding Contract Year (‘First-Time CBT Payor’);  
(ii) 30% if the Club exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in  
the preceding Contract Year, but did not exceed the Base Tax  
Threshold in the Contract Year two years prior (“Second-Time  
CBT Payor’); and  
(111) 50% if the Club exceeded the Base Tax Threshold in  
both of the two preceding Contract Years (or in more than two  
preceding Contract Years) (“Third-Time CBT Payor’).  
(b) In determining in how many consecutive preceding Con-  
tract Years a Club’s Actual Club Payroll exceeded the Base Tax  
Threshold (and, accordingly, whether a Club is a First-, Second-,  
or Third-Time CBT Payor), instances in which the Club’s Actual  
Club Payroll exceeded the “Tax Threshold” (as defined in Article  
XXIII of the 2012—2016 Basic Agreement) in any Contract Year  
covered by the 2012—2016 Basic Agreement shall be counted. To  
illustrate, a Club that had an Actual Club Payroll above $189 mil-  
lion in both the 2015 and 2016 Contract Years (when, under the  
terms of the 2012—2016 Basic Agreement, the Tax Threshold was  
$189 million), and has an Actual Club Payroll for the 2017 Con-  
tract Year that exceeds $195 million (the Base Tax Threshold for  
the 2017 Contract Year), shall be deemed to have exceeded the  
Base Tax Thresholds in the two Contract Years prior to the 2017  
Contract Year and, therefore, would be considered a Third-Time  
CBT Payor and charged a Base Tax Rate of 50% in 2017.  
(4) Surcharge Thresholds, Rates, and Penalties  
In addition to the Base Tax Threshold for each Contract Year,  
there shall be two Surcharge Thresholds. A Club with an Actual  
Club Payroll that exceeds one or both of the Surcharge Thresholds  
applicable in that Contract Year shall be assessed an additional  
Competitive Balance Tax on the amount by which its Actual Club  
Payroll exceeds the Surcharge Threshold(s), as set forth below.  
108  
(a) Surcharge Thresholds  
(i) First Surcharge Threshold: The First Surcharge  
Threshold shall be $215 million in the 2017 Contract Year,  
$217 million in the 2018 Contract Year, $226 million in the  
2019 Contract Year, $228 million in the 2020 Contract Year,  
and $230 million in the 2021 Contract Year.  
(41) Second Surcharge Threshold: The Second Surcharge  
Threshold shall be $235 million in the 2017 Contract Year,  
$237 million in the 2018 Contract Year, $246 million in the  
2019 Contract Year, $248 million in the 2020 Contract Year,  
and $250 million in the 2021 Contract Year.  
(b) Surcharge Rates  
In addition to the Base Tax Rate applicable to the amount by  
which Actual Club Payroll exceeds the Base Tax Threshold, Clubs  
with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds one or both Surcharge  
Thresholds will pay an additional Competitive Balance Tax on the  
amount of its Actual Club Payroll over the applicable Surcharge  
Threshold(s) for that Contract Year. All proceeds generated as a  
result of these surcharges shall be considered proceeds of the  
Competitive Balance Tax for purposes of Section B(6) below.  
(i) Surcharge Rate for Exceeding the First Surcharge  
Threshold: A Club with an Actual Club Payroll that exceeds  
the First Surcharge Threshold shall pay a 12% surcharge rate,  
on top of the applicable Base Tax Rate, on the amount of its  
Actual Club Payroll above the First Surcharge Threshold but  
at or below the Second Surcharge Threshold.  
(11) Surcharge Rate for Exceeding the Second Surcharge  
Threshold: A Club with an Actual Payroll that exceeds the  
Second Surcharge Threshold in any Contract Year shall pay an  
additional 45% surcharge rate, on top of the applicable Base  
Tax Rate, on the difference between its Actual Club Payroll  
and the Second Surcharge Threshold. Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, a First-Time CBT Payor Club shall be charged a  
42.5% surcharge rate (rather than the 45% surcharge rate  
applicable to Second- or Third-Time CBT Payor Clubs) on the  
difference between its Actual Club Payroll and the Second  
Surcharge Threshold.  
109  
The following chart summarizes the Competitive Balance  
Tax rate a First-, Second-, and Third-Time CBT Payor would  
incur on the portions of its Actual Club Payroll exceeding the  
Base Tax Threshold, the First Surcharge Threshold, and the  
Second Surcharge Threshold.  
AGL First-Time |Second-Time | Third-Timet+

£520 (Base Tax Rate)  
$20-$40 (Base Tax +  
Ist Surcharge Rate) a  
>$40 (Base Tax +  
By way of illustration, a Third-Time CBT Payor Club with  
a $260 million payroll in 2018 will pay a 50% tax rate on its  
payroll between $197 million and $217 million; a 62% tax rate  
on its payroll between $217 million and $237 million; and a  
95% tax rate on payroll in excess of $237 million.  
   
(c) Rule 4 Draft Selection Penalty for Exceeding Second  
Surcharge Threshold  
Beginning in the 2018 Contract Year and continuing thereafter,  
any Club with an Actual Club Payroll at or above the applicable  
Second Surcharge Threshold in that Contract Year shall have its  
highest available selection in the next Rule 4 Draft moved back  
ten places in the Draft order. This penalty will apply in each Con-  
tract Year in which the Club exceeds the Second Surcharge  
Threshold, regardless of whether the Club is a First-, Second-, or  
Third-Time CBT Payor or whether the Club has incurred the  
same penalty for exceeding the Second Surcharge Threshold in a  
prior year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Club shall not have  
its highest available selection moved back in the Draft if that  
selection is in the top six selections of the first round of the Draft  
(not including supplemental selections awarded pursuant to  
Major League Rule 4(c)(2)), but rather shall have its second-  
highest selection moved back ten places.  
For purposes of this section, a Club’s highest available selec-  
tion or second-highest available selection in the next Rule 4  
110  
Draft, whichever is applicable, shall be determined after account-  
ing for any selections received or forfeited pursuant to Article  
XX(B)(4) or Major League Rules 3(c)(4)(B), 4(c)(2), or 4(k); or  
selections acquired via assignment.  
The penalty shall be assessed immediately preceding the Rule  
4 Draft.  
(5) Phase-In for the 2017 Contract Year  
For the 2017 Contract Year only, a Club’s Competitive Balance  
Tax obligation and/or penalties shall be the lesser of: (1) the amount  
of Competitive Balance Tax the Club would owe for the 2017 Con-  
tract Year under the terms of Sections B(1)-(4) above; and (11) the  
average of the amount of Competitive Balance Tax the Club would  
owe for the 2017 Contract Year under the terms of Sections B(1)-(4)  
above and the amount of Competitive Balance Tax the Club would  
have owed had the terms of Article XXIII in effect in 2016 (1.e., a  
$189 million Tax Threshold and the Competitive Balance Tax rates  
set forth in Article XXIII(B)(3) of the 2012—2016 Basic Agreement)  
remained in effect in 2017.  
(6) Collection of Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  
(a) On the December 2 following each Contract Year, the  
Commissioner’s Office shall notify the Association and all Clubs  
of any amounts owed by any Clubs under the Competitive Bal-  
ance Tax. Clubs shall make Competitive Balance Tax payments  
to the Commissioner’s Office on or before January 21 of the next  
calendar year.  
(b) Any Club that does not remit the full amount of the Com-  
petitive Balance Tax due by that date shall have its next Major  
League Central Fund (“Central Fund’’) distribution and subse-  
quent distributions, each net of any debt service obligation under  
the industry credit facility, reduced by up to 50% until such obli-  
gation is satisfied. For purposes of this subparagraph (b) only,  
royalty payments from Major League Baseball Properties shall  
not be considered part of a Club’s Central Fund distribution.  
Beginning with the day following the payment date specified in  
subparagraph (a) above, interest shall be charged on any unpaid  
Competitive Balance Tax amounts at the Imputed Loan Interest  
111  
Rate for the then current Contract Year. Any interest collected  
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be for the benefit of and  
made available to the Industry Growth Fund.  
C. Determination of Actual Club Payroll  
(1) Definition of Actual Club Payroll  
“Actual Club Payroll” of a Club in a Contract Year shall be the  
sum of:  
(a) a 1/30th share of Player Benefit Costs (and a similar pro  
rata share if the number of Major League Clubs changes), as  
determined in Section D below;  
(b) the sum of the yearly Salaries (as determined in accor-  
dance with Section E below and as allocated among Clubs in  
accordance with this Section C) attributable to that Contract Year  
of all Players under a Uniform Player’s Contract with the Club  
for that Contract Year (including optionally assigned contracts);  
and  
(c) any other amount includible in or deductible from Actual  
Club Payroll as a result of the operation of Section C(2)(f) below  
or as aresult of any Club, any Player and/or either of the Parties  
hereto having engaged in a transaction contrary to Section G(1)  
below or as a result of an award by the Arbitration Panel under  
Article XI and/or Section F below.  
(2) Rules for Allocation of Salary  
(a) General Rule  
If a Player remains on a Major League Club’s Active List (as  
defined in Article XXI) for an entire championship season, then  
all of the Salary attributable to the Contract Year in which that  
championship season falls shall be allocated to the Club’s Actual  
Club Payroll in that Contract Year.  
(b) Assignment of Contract  
(1) General Rule: Ifa Uniform Player’s Contract is assigned  
by any means to another Major League Club, the assignor Club  
shall be allocated Salary through the date of the assignment and  
112  
Salary shall begin being allocated to the assignee Club on the fol-  
lowing day, regardless of the Player’s reporting date.  
(41) Bonuses: Salary arising from Performance Bonuses  
earned after the assignment shall be allocated between the  
assignor and assignee Clubs in proportion to the total number of  
relevant events attained during the Contract Year with each Club.  
Salary arising from Award Bonuses earned after the assignment  
and within the Contract Year of the assignment shall be allocated  
to the Actual Club Payrolls of the assignor and assignee Clubs  
pursuant to Section C(2)(b)(1) above. Salary arising from assign-  
ment bonuses earned upon or after the assignment and within the  
Contract Year of the assignment shall be included in the Actual  
Club Payroll of the Club(s) responsible for paying it in the Con-  
tract Year in which the bonus is earned.  
(111) Cash Consideration: An assignor Club that pays cash  
consideration to defray all or part of the salary obligation of the  
assignee Club for an assigned Player or Players shall include  
such cash consideration in its Actual Club Payroll on a pro-rata  
basis over the remaining Guaranteed Years of the assigned Con-  
tract(s). Cash consideration that is conditionally payable based  
on the Player’s earning of performance or award bonuses will be  
included in the Actual Club Payroll of the Club responsible for  
paying the bonus in the Contract Year in which the bonus is  
earned. Cash consideration that is conditionally payable based  
on the outcome of Club or Player Option decisions will be  
included in the pro-rata calculation described above if the con-  
sideration is contingent on the decline of a Club Option Year or  
the exercise of a Player Option Year, but will not be included if  
contingent on the exercise of a Club Option Year or the decline  
of a Player Option Year. If any cash consideration not originally  
included in the pro-rata calculation described above is ultimately  
paid as a result of the outcome of Club or Player Option deci-  
sions, the cash consideration will be included in the Contract  
Year(s) covered by the Club or Player Options. An assignor Club  
that pays cash consideration in lieu of assigning an unnamed  
player shall include such cash consideration in its Actual Club  
Payroll in the Contract Year in which the cash consideration  
is paid.  
113  
Any cash consideration that is included in the Actual Club Pay-  
roll of the payor Club shall be subtracted from the Actual Club  
Payroll of the payee Club in the same Contract Year in which it is  
added to the payor Club’s Actual Club Payroll. Notwithstanding  
the foregoing, an assignee Club may not receive an aggregate  
credit against its Actual Club Payroll(s) for cash consideration  
received in an assignment that exceeds the sum of (a) the total  
amount of the acquired Player(s) Salaries that are included in the  
Club’s Actual Club Payroll(s) following the assignment, and (b)  
any cash consideration paid by the assignee Club to another Club  
in a subsequent assignment of the acquired Player(s) that is attrib-  
utable to those Players.  
(iv) Salary Increase Upon Assignment: Ifa Uniform Player’s  
Contract provides for an increase in Salary upon its assignment  
to another Major League Club, such increase shall be included in  
a Player’s Salary upon assignment and attributed to the Contract  
Year (or Years) in which it is to be paid. Any such increase in  
Salary attributable to the Contract Year during which the assign-  
ment occurred shall be treated as an assignment bonus and allo-  
cated to the Actual Club Payrolls of the assignor and assignee  
Clubs pursuant to Section C(2)(b)(i1) above. Any such increase in  
Salary attributable to a later Contract Year shall be allocated  
exclusively to the assignee Club.  
(c) Contract Signed After Opening Day  
If a Player first enters into a Uniform Player’s Contract with a  
Club after Opening Day of the championship season with a Base  
Salary payable over a full championship season, the Club shall  
include in Actual Club Payroll such pro rata portion of the Base  
Salary attributable to that Contract Year as the number of days  
that the Player was on the Club’s Active List (as defined in  
Article XXI) bears to the number of days in the championship  
season. Notwithstanding the above, if such Uniform Player’s  
Contract covers multiple championship seasons, the Club shall  
instead include in Actual Club Payroll for the first championship  
season covered by the Contract the amount calculated pursuant to  
subsection E(2) below.  
114  
(d) Termination of Contract  
(1) Ifa Club terminates a Uniform Player’s Contract that cov-  
ers a single championship season, the Club shall include in its  
Actual Club Payroll for the Contract Year in which that season  
falls any Salary paid to that Player, either under this Agreement  
or a Special Covenant to the Contract (subject to any offset called  
for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant).  
(11) If a Club terminates a multi-year Uniform Player’s Con-  
tract while it remains obligated to pay Salary under either this  
Agreement or a Special Covenant to the Contract, Salary shall be  
allocated to that Club for each Contract Year during which its  
obligation continues. Salary shall be attributed to each such Con-  
tract Year pursuant to this Article XXIII (subject to any offset  
called for by this Agreement or a Special Covenant). This attribu-  
tion shall apply even if the Club pays the Salary in advance.  
(e) Split Contracts  
The earnings of a Player signatory to a Split Contract shall be  
included in Actual Club Payroll at the total amount of the  
Player’s actual baseball earnings under that Contract from Major  
League Clubs (and from Minor League clubs, if any) for that  
Contract Year.  
(f) Outright Assignment to a Minor League club  
Any Uniform Player’s Contract that is assigned outright to a  
Minor League club during the term of this Agreement shall be  
included in the Club’s Actual Club Payroll. Any Uniform  
Player’s Contract that was assigned outright to a Minor League  
club prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall be  
excluded from Actual Club Payroll; provided, however, that if  
any Uniform Player’s Contract that was assigned outright to a  
Minor League club prior to this Agreement is subsequently  
selected to a Club’s 40-man roster, the entire remaining Salary  
under that Uniform Player’s Contract shall be included in Actual  
Club Payroll, even if the Player is thereafter assigned outright to  
a Minor League club.  
115  
D. Benefits or Player Benefit Costs  
(1) Definition  
The Clubs’ Benefits or Player Benefit Costs for a particular Con-  
tract Year shall include the sums paid (or to be paid on a proper  
accrual basis for that Contract Year) by or on behalf of the Clubs for,  
to, or on behalf of present Players (and former Players when  
expressly noted) for:  
(a) contributions to the Major League Baseball Players Bene-  
fit Plan, in the full amounts called for by paragraph 5 of the  
Agreement re Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan  
(including contributions made on behalf of former Players and  
others but excluding contributions made from Competitive Bal-  
ance Tax proceeds);  
(b) workers’ compensation premiums, payroll, unemployment  
compensation and social security taxes (including payments  
made on behalf of a Player released from a Contract that covers  
that Contract Year, provided that the Player’s Salary is included  
in a Club’s final Actual Club Payroll for that Contract Year);  
(c) Spring Training allowances (as described in Article  
VII(C)), championship season meal and tip allowances (as  
described in Article VII(B)), All-Star Game expenses (as  
described in Article VII(D)) and “in-season supplemental  
allowances” (as described in Article VII(E));  
(d) moving and traveling expenses (as described in Article  
VIII), including payments made to former Players in connection  
with relocations resulting from assignments while they were  
active Players;  
(e) contributions (in their entirety) to the post-season Players’  
pool as described in Article X;  
(f) the College Scholarship Plan and Continuing Education  
Program (including payments made on behalf of former players);  
and  
(g) player medical costs (e.g., fees to doctors, hospitals, and  
other health care providers, and the drugs and other medical sup-  
plies for the treatment of Player injuries), but not including  
salaries of trainers or other Club personnel, or the costs of Club  
116  
medical or training equipment, or any costs reimbursed or paid for  
through workers’ compensation or any other medical insurance.  
Starting with the 2017 Contract Year and for purposes of sub-  
paragraph (a) above, the first $13 million of CBT proceeds in the  
prior Contract Year (or whatever portion thereof if less than $13  
million in CBT proceeds is collected) that are used to defray Club  
funding obligations arising from the Players Benefit Plan shall be  
deducted from Players Benefit Plan Costs. In no event shall this  
deduction exceed $13 million in aggregate for the 30 Clubs in  
any Contract Year.  
For the 2017 Contract Year, the Clubs’ costs under paragraphs  
(b) through (g) above shall be $219,300,000 ($7,310,000 per  
Club).  
(2) Limitation on Annual Increase  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, beginning with the increase from  
the 2017 to the 2018 Contract Year, the annual rate of increase for  
the Clubs’ costs under paragraphs (b) through (g) above shall be the  
higher of 6.0% and the annual rate of increase over that year in the  
combined “sum of the yearly Salaries” (described in Section C(1)(b)  
above) for all Clubs.  
E. Determination of Salary  
The determination of a Player’s Salary for a particular Contract Year  
for the purposes of interpretation and application of this Article XXIII  
only shall be in accordance with the following rules.  
(1) General Rule  
“Salary” shall mean the value of the total compensation (cash or  
otherwise) paid to a Player pursuant to the terms of a Uniform  
Player’s Contract, including any guarantee by the Club of payments  
by third parties, for a particular championship season. Salary shall  
include, without limitation, the value of non-cash compensation such  
as the provision of personal translators, personal massage therapists,  
and airfare and tickets exceeding normal Club allotments. Consistent  
with the rules set out below, all compensation paid to a Player pur-  
suant to the terms of a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be attributa-  
117  
ble to the Contract Year(s) in which the Player is required under the  
Contract to render services to a Club as a baseball player, regardless  
of how the compensation is characterized under the Contract.  
(2) Average Annual Value of Guaranteed Multi-Year Contracts  
A Uniform Player’s Contract with a term of more than one (1)  
championship season (“Multi-Year Contract’) shall be deemed to  
have a Salary in each Guaranteed Year equal to the “Average Annual  
Value” (“AAV”) of the Contract (plus any bonuses subsequently  
included by operation of Section E(4) below). The AAV shall be cal-  
culated as follows: the sum of (a) the Base Salary in each Guaran-  
teed Year plus (b) any portion of a Signing Bonus (or any other  
payment that this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) attributed to  
a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(3) below plus (c)  
any deferred compensation or annuity compensation costs attributed  
to a Guaranteed Year in accordance with Section E(6) below shall  
be divided by the number of Guaranteed Years. Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, if a Multi-Year Contract is signed after Opening Day of  
the championship season, the: (1) Base Salary in the first Guaranteed  
Year for purposes of the AAV calculation shall be determined by  
multiplying that Base Salary by a fraction, the numerator of which  
shall be the number of championship season days that the Player  
was paid the Base Salary, and the denominator shall be the number  
of championship season days in that championship season; and (11)  
the first Guaranteed Year shall not be considered a full Guaranteed  
Year for purposes of the AAV calculation, but shall be considered a  
partial year equal to the fraction described in subsection (1) above.  
(3) Signing Bonuses  
Any Signing Bonus in a Uniform Player’s Contract (and any  
other payment this Article deems to be a Signing Bonus) shall be  
attributed, pro rata, over the Guaranteed Years of the Contract. If a  
Contract contains no Guaranteed Years, the Signing Bonus shall be  
attributed in full to the first year of the Contract.  
(4) Performance, Award and Other Bonuses  
(a) Any amounts that are actually earned by a Player as Perfor-  
mance Bonuses, Award Bonuses or any other bonuses properly  
included in a Uniform Player’s Contract shall be included as part of  
118  
the Player’s Salary in the Contract Year in which the service or per-  
formance giving rise to the Bonus was provided. Potential bonuses  
shall not be included in the AAV calculation made pursuant to Sec-  
tion E(2) above.  
(b) A Special Covenant in a Uniform Player’s Contract that pro-  
vides that Player performance or achievement in one year of the  
Contract will increase the Base Salary in other year(s) of the Con-  
tract shall not be considered in the determination of Salary until the  
triggering event occurs (other than, if applicable, as a “potential  
bonus’’), unless it is determined by the Arbitration Panel that the  
Special Covenant was designed to defeat or circumvent the inten-  
tion of the Parties as reflected in this Article XXIII. As long as such  
a finding is not made, the additional Base Salary triggered by the  
Special Covenant shall count as part of the Player’s Salary in the  
Contract Year(s) to which it is attributed by the Contract once the  
triggering event has occurred. Multi-Year Contracts shall not be  
recalculated on an AAV basis once the triggering event has  
occurred; the additional Base Salary shall be added to the Salary as  
originally calculated for the Contract Year in question.  
(5) Option Contracts  
(a) Definitions  
(i) A “Club Option Year” shall mean a championship season  
covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount  
payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  
guaranteed at the election of the Club or by reason of specified  
performance by a Player. Club Option Years shall not be consid-  
ered “Guaranteed Years.” In addition, any other championship  
season included in a Multi-Year Contract that is not a Guaranteed  
Year shall be treated as a Club Option Year.  
(11) A “Player Option Year” shall mean a championship season  
covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract: (A) in which the amount  
payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  
guaranteed at the election of the Player; or (B) that can be nulli-  
fied by a Player for a reason other than those set forth in para-  
graph 7 of the Contract. A Player Option Year shall be considered  
a “Guaranteed Year” if, pursuant to the Player’s right to elect or  
subject to his right to nullify, the terms of that year are guaran-  
119  
teed within the definition in Section A(8); provided, however,  
that a Player Option Year shall not be considered a Guaranteed  
Year if the payment the Player 1s to receive if he declines to exer-  
cise his option or nullifies the championship season is more than  
50% of the Base Salary payable for that championship season. In  
the event that the Player has the right to exercise or nullify mul-  
tiple Contract Years at one time (“Player Opt-Out’), the Contract  
Years following the Player Opt-Out shall be considered Guaran-  
teed Years; provided however, that the Contract Years following  
the Player Opt-Out shall not be considered Guaranteed Years if  
the payment the Player is to receive if he opts out of the Contract  
is more than 50% of the sum of the Base Salaries in the Contract  
Years following the Player Opt-Out.  
(111) A “Dual Option Year” shall mean a championship season  
covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount  
payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  
guaranteed at the election of either the Player or the Club. Salaries  
under any such Contract shall be calculated as if the Dual Option  
Year is a Player Option Year.  
(iv) A “Mutual Option Year’ shall mean a championship sea-  
son covered by a Uniform Player’s Contract in which the amount  
payable pursuant to paragraph 2 of the Contract becomes due or  
guaranteed only upon the election of both the Player and the Club.  
Salaries under any such Contract shall be calculated as if the  
Mutual Option Year is a Club Option Year.  
(b) Option Buyouts  
(1) General Rule  
(A) Ifa Uniform Player’s Contract contains a Club Option  
Year or a Player Option Year that is not deemed a Guaranteed  
Year pursuant to subparagraph (a)(11) above and the Player is  
to receive consideration upon the non-exercise of that option  
or the nullification of a championship season (“Option Buy-  
out’), then such Option Buyout shall be deemed a Signing  
Bonus. If a Uniform Player’s Contract contains an Option  
Buyout for a Club decision not to exercise a Club Option Year  
and an Option Buyout for a Player decision not to exercise a  
Player Option Year (or to nullify a championship season) that  
120  
is deemed a Signing Bonus pursuant to this subparagraph  
(b)(1), then the higher Option Buyout payment shall be deemed  
the Signing Bonus.  
(B) If a Contract contains an Option Buyout relating to  
more than one Option Year, then only the Option Buyout that  
relates to the earliest Option Year in the Contract shall be  
deemed a Signing Bonus. If, however, the Player ultimately  
receives an Option Buyout that relates to an Option Year other  
than the earliest Option Year, that Option Buyout shall be  
included in Salary in the Contract Year covered by the option  
that was not exercised.  
(C) Ifa Contract contains an earned bonus that increases an  
Option Buyout, the Bonus shall be included in the Salary  
attributed to the Contract Year immediately preceding the rel-  
evant Option Year.  
(11) Potential Adjustment to Payroll  
Notwithstanding subparagraph (b)(i) above, if the Player  
ultimately does not receive the Option Buyout, then for the  
Contract Year covered by that option, no portion of the Buyout  
shall be included in any Club’s final Actual Club Payroll. In  
addition, any Club whose final Actual Club Payroll in a previ-  
ous Contract Year had included that Buyout (or a portion  
thereof) will receive a deduction (in the full amount of the  
Buyout included in previous Contract Years) in its final Actual  
Club Payroll in the Contract Year covered by that option.  
(c) Club Option Years  
Ifa Uniform Player’s Contract covers one or more seasons that  
are Club Option Years, the Player’s Salary for the championship  
seasons that are Club Option Years, if exercised, shall be the total  
of the Base Salary and any bonuses included by operation of Sec-  
tion E(4) above.  
(d) Player Option Years  
(i) If a Player fails to exercise or chooses to nullify a Player  
Option Year that is deemed a Guaranteed Year pursuant to Sec-  
tion E(5)(a)(i1) above, the difference between the amount paid to  
the Player under his Contract (including any Option Buyout pay-  
12]  
ment) and the amount that has been attributed to Actual Club  
Payroll of a Club under that Contract shall be added to (or sub-  
tracted from) Actual Club Payroll in the Contract Year in which  
the Player Option Year falls. If the Contract has been assigned,  
the adjustment called for in the preceding sentence shall be made  
to the Actual Club Payroll(s) of the Club(s) to which Salary  
under that Contract had been attributed in any Contract Year. If  
a Player exercises or fails to nullify a Player Option Year that  
was not deemed a Guaranteed Year, the Player’s Salary in the  
Player Option Year shall be the difference between the Salary  
provided in the Player Option Year (including any earned  
bonuses) and the Option Buyout that had been attributed, in all  
previous Contract Years, to a Club pursuant to Section E(5)(b)()  
above.  
(11) If the Base Salary (plus any deferred compensation or  
annuity costs) in a Player Option Year (“Player Option Year  
Value’’) is less than 80% of the Base Salary (plus any attributed  
Signing Bonus, deferred compensation or annuity costs) in the  
Guaranteed Year with the smallest such figure before the first  
such Player Option Year (80% Figure), then, for each such Player  
Option Year, the difference between the Player Option Year Value  
and the 80% Figure shall be allocated pro rata across the Guaran-  
teed Years preceding the first such Player Option Year; provided,  
however, that if the 80% Figure is itself less than 75% of the AAV  
of the Contract (calculated as if the Player Option Year was not a  
Guaranteed Year), then the 80% Figure shall instead be 75% of  
the AAV calculation set out immediately above.  
(6) Deferred Compensation  
(a) Definition  
“Deferred Compensation” shall mean any Salary payable to a  
Player pursuant to a Uniform Player’s Contract in a Contract Year  
after the last championship season for which the Contract  
requires services as a baseball player to be rendered.  
(b) Attribution  
(1) Deferred Compensation shall be included in a Player’s  
Salary as if paid in the championship season to which it 1s attrib-  
uted under a Uniform Player’s Contract. If a Contract does not  
122  
attribute Deferred Compensation, the Contract shall be treated as  
if the Deferred Compensation was attributed equally to each of  
the Guaranteed Years in the Contract.  
(11) If the Deferred Compensation is to be paid with interest at  
an effective rate that 1s within one and one-half percentage points  
of the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first Contract Year cov-  
ered by the Contract, then the Deferred Compensation shall be  
included at its stated value. Otherwise, the Deferred Compensa-  
tion shall be included at its present value in the season to which  
it is attributed, said present value to be calculated by increasing  
any such payments by the Contract’s stated interest rate, if any,  
and then reducing such payments back to their present value by  
applying as a discount rate the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the  
first Contract Year covered by the Contract. If the terms of a Con-  
tract are confirmed by the Association and the Office of the Com-  
missioner before the Imputed Loan Interest Rate for the first  
Contract Year covered by the contract is available, the Imputed  
Loan Interest Rate shall be the annual “Federal mid-term rate” as  
defined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the  
month preceding the month in which terms are confirmed. If a  
Uniform Player’s Contract uses the date or year in which a Player  
retires as a triggering event for the commencement of payment of  
the Deferred Compensation, it will be assumed for purposes of  
calculating Salary under this Article only that the Player retires  
on the day that he reaches age 40 or at the end of the Contract,  
whichever is later.  
(c) An “Annuity Compensation Arrangement” is an agreement  
in a Uniform Player’s Contract whereby the Club promises to pur-  
chase an annuity to pay the Player after he is no longer required to  
render services as a baseball player under such Uniform Player’s  
Contract.  
(1) The portion of the cost of the annuity to be paid by the  
Club while the Player is required to render services as a baseball  
player under the Contract shall be included as Salary for the Con-  
tract Year in which such cost is to be paid.  
(11) The portion of the cost of the annuity instrument to be  
paid by the Club after the Player is no longer required to render  
services as a baseball player under such Contract, if any, shall be  
123  
treated as Deferred Compensation attributable pro rata over the  
Guaranteed Years of the Contract at its present value as calcu-  
lated pursuant to paragraph (6)(b) above. Any compensation that  
the Player is scheduled to receive pursuant to such Annuity Com-  
pensation Arrangement shall not be considered Salary or  
Deferred Compensation.  
(7) Loans to Players  
For purposes of this Article XXIII, the following rules shall apply  
to any loans made by a Club to or at the direction of a Player.  
(a) If any such loan bears no interest rate or an effective inter-  
est rate more than one and one-half percentage points below the  
Imputed Loan Interest Rate, then an amount of “Imputed  
Income” as calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b) below shall  
be included in the Player’s Salary for each Contract Year that the  
loan remains unpaid. For any other loan, there shall be no  
‘“Imputed Income” (as defined in subparagraph (b) below)  
included in the Player’s Salary.  
(b) “Imputed Income” for each Contract Year covered by a  
Uniform Player’s Contract shall be calculated by multiplying the  
difference between the Imputed Loan Interest Rate and the stated  
rate, if any, by the outstanding balance of the loan.  
(c) If a Club has made a loan to a Player and forgives part or  
all of the loan, the forgiven loan amount shall be counted as Salary  
in the Contract Year in which the loan is forgiven; provided, how-  
ever, that if a loan that 1s made after October 23, 2006 is forgiven  
in a Contract Year in which there is no Competitive Balance Tax,  
and if the Club forgiving the loan would have been assessed a  
Competitive Balance Tax for any Contract Year had the loan, by  
itself or in combination with other loans, been considered Salary  
from the outset, then the forgiveness of the loan shall be presumed  
to be an action designed to defeat or circumvent the Competitive  
Balance Tax. Unless the Club that forgave such a loan can rebut  
the foregoing presumption, the Club shall be required to pay into  
the Central Fund an amount equal to the Competitive Balance  
Tax(es) that the Club would have paid (based on the Tax Thresh-  
olds that were in effect when final Actual Club Payrolls were cal-  
124  
culated for the Contract Year(s) in which a Competitive Balance  
Tax would have been paid) had the forgiven loan (or portion  
thereof) originally been considered Salary.  
F. Association’s Rights  
(1) Actual Club Payroll Information  
(a) In each Contract Year in which the Competitive Balance Tax  
is operational, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide the  
Association with two “Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compila-  
tions,” the first of which shall be provided within 14 days following  
Opening Day of that championship season and the second of which  
shall be provided within 14 days following that season’s All-Star  
Game. Each Preliminary Actual Club Payroll Compilation shall  
consist of a list of each Club’s Actual Club Payroll, broken down by  
Player, and an estimate of Player Benefit Costs for that Contract  
Year, as of Opening Day and the All-Star Game, respectively. In  
addition to the above, the Association may, from time to time,  
request the Office of the Commissioner to produce a Preliminary  
Actual Club Payroll Compilation or any portion thereof (including  
the Office of the Commissioner evaluation of any Uniform Player’s  
Contract, the terms of which have been confirmed by the Associa-  
tion and the Office of the Commissioner) and the Office of the Com-  
missioner shall provide such information within 14 days of each  
such request, provided that the Association will not make an unrea-  
sonable number of requests in any Contract Year.  
(b) Upon the presentation of any evidence that a Player and a  
Club are prepared to agree to a Uniform Player’s Contract, either  
Party to this Agreement (1.e., the Association or Office of the Com-  
missioner) may initiate a process whereby the Parties prepare and  
exchange evaluations of that prospective Contract for Competitive  
Balance Tax purposes. The evaluations shall be exchanged within  
48 hours of the initiation of the process by either Party.  
(c) The Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Association  
with a list of the final Actual Club Payrolls, broken down by Player,  
and Player Benefit Costs for that Contract Year and the Competitive  
Balance Tax assessed against each Club (“final Actual Club Payroll  
Compilation’), if any, for the just completed championship season  
125  
on or before the December 2 following each championship season  
covered by this Agreement in which the Competitive Balance Tax is  
applicable.  
(2) Associations Rights to Challenge  
(a) Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(1)(a)  
The Association shall have the right to question any calculation  
included in any information provided pursuant to Section F(1)(a)  
above and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer  
to any such question within 10 days. If thereafter the Association  
disagrees with any calculation, it may file a challenge in the Griev-  
ance Procedure in Article XI at any time before the next November  
30. At the request of either Party, any such Grievance shall be han-  
dled on an expedited basis, with documents being exchanged within  
10 days of the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within  
15 days of the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an  
Award (with opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days  
after the commencement of the hearing. Failure by the Association  
to challenge any such calculation shall not preclude the Association  
from challenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club  
Payroll Compilation nor shall such failure be of any relevance in  
such a challenge.  
(b) Information Provided Pursuant to Section F(1)(b)  
The Association shall have the right to question any calculation  
included in any information exchanged pursuant to Section F(1)(b)  
above and the Office of the Commissioner shall provide an answer  
to any such question within 24 hours. If thereafter the Association  
disagrees with the calculation put forward by the Office of the Com-  
missioner, it may file a challenge in the Grievance Procedure in  
Article XI within three business days. Any such Grievance shall be  
handled on an expedited basis, with documents being exchanged as  
soon as possible, a hearing commencing within three business days  
of the filing of the Grievance (or as soon thereafter as 1s practicable)  
and the Panel issuing an Award (with opinion to follow, if neces-  
sary) no later than three business days after the commencement of  
the hearing. Failure by the Association to challenge any such calcu-  
lation shall not preclude the Association from challenging that cal-  
126  
culation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll Compilation, nor  
shall such failure be of any relevance in such a challenge. Failure by  
the Office of the Commissioner to raise or pursue with the Arbitra-  
tion Panel any disagreement with the Association concerning infor-  
mation exchanged pursuant to Section F(1)(b) above shall be  
irrelevant to any challenge by the Association to any calculation.  
(c) Information Provided Pursuant to Section FC )(c)  
The Association may challenge any calculation included in infor-  
mation provided pursuant to Section F(1)(c) (the final Actual Club  
Payroll Compilation) by filing a Grievance pursuant to Article XI.  
If the Association disagrees with any calculation that affects the  
Competitive Balance Taxes assessed for that Contract Year, it shall  
file a Grievance within 45 days after it has received that Year’s final  
Actual Club Payroll Compilation and the notice of assessed Com-  
petitive Balance Taxes (see Section B(6)(a)). Failure by the Associ-  
ation to challenge any calculation included in a final Actual Club  
Payroll Compilation shall not preclude the Association from chal-  
lenging that calculation if contained in a final Actual Club Payroll  
Compilation for a later Contract Year, nor shall such failure be of  
any relevance in such a challenge. Such a challenge, however, will  
not result in changes to Competitive Balance Tax amounts assessed  
for prior Contract Years. Any Grievance challenging a final Actual  
Club Payroll Compilation shall be handled by the Parties on an  
expedited basis with documents being exchanged within 10 days of  
the filing of the Grievance, a hearing commencing within 15 days of  
the filing of the Grievance and the Panel issuing an Award (with  
opinion to follow, if necessary) no later than 15 days after the com-  
mencement of the hearing. The filing of a Grievance by the Associ-  
ation shall not preclude the Office of the Commissioner from  
assessing and collecting the Competitive Balance Tax in accordance  
with Section B and using Competitive Balance Tax proceeds in  
accordance with Section H, unless the Chair of the Arbitration  
Panel, upon application by the Association, provides otherwise.  
Unless the Chair provides otherwise, any adjustments to the Com-  
petitive Balance Tax assessments and distributions made pursuant to  
this Section F necessitated by the resolution of an Association  
Grievance shall be made by the Office of the Commissioner once  
the Grievance 1s finally resolved.  
127  
(d) Relationship to Grievance Procedure  
(1) Nothing in this Section F is intended to affect the applica-  
tion of the Grievance Procedure to any other complaint involv-  
ing the existence or interpretation of, or compliance with, this  
Article XXIII or any provision therein. Moreover, unless specif-  
ically modified by this Section F, it is intended that the provi-  
sions of Article XI will govern the resolution of disputes under  

### this Article XXIII.  
### 
(11) It is agreed that the existence of the expedited procedures  
in this Section F will not prohibit either Party from arguing that  
another dispute subject to Article XI should be heard prior to any  
dispute related to this Article X XIII.  
G. Other Undertakings  
(1) Neither the Parties hereto nor any Club or any Player shall  
enter into any agreement, Uniform Player’s Contract or other trans-  
action, that includes any terms designed to defeat or circumvent the  
intention of the Parties as reflected by this Article XXIII.  
(2) At the time a Club and a Player enter into any Uniform  
Player’s Contract, or at the time of the assignment of any Uniform  
Player’s Contract, there shall be no unreported understandings or  
agreements of any kind between the Player and the Club. No other  
understandings or agreements, whether made before or after the  
signing of the Uniform Player’s Contract or its assignment, shall be  
valid, recognizable or of any effect whatsoever, unless expressly set  
forth in a new or supplemental Uniform Player’s Contract executed  
by the Player and the Club and complying with this Agreement and  
the Major League Rules. (See “Supplemental Agreements” para-  
graph of the Uniform Player’s Contract.)  
(3) A Club and a Player currently signatory to a Uniform  
Player’s Contract may agree to modify or amend their contractual  
relationship by entering into a new Uniform Player’s Contract that  
covers the next succeeding championship season if the following  
conditions are satisfied:  
(a) If the new Uniform Player’s Contract is signed between  
the last day of one championship season and the first day of the  
next championship season, it must begin no later than the  
128  
H.  
championship season following the next succeeding champion-  
ship season; and if it does not begin with the next championship  
season, it cannot modify the terms of the Uniform Player’s Con-  
tract covering the next succeeding championship season.  
(b) If the new Uniform Player’s Contract is signed during  
the championship season, it must begin with the next succeeding  
championship season and cannot modify the terms of the Uni-  
form Player’s Contract covering the then current championship  
season.  
The AAV of such new Contract shall be increased or  
decreased, whichever is applicable and beginning with the new  
Contract’s first Contract Year, by the figure arrived at by subtract-  
ing the amount of Salary that has been attributed under the rules  
of this Article XXIII to a Club in previous Contract Years under  
the Contract that is being replaced from the amount that was actu-  
ally paid to the Player by a Club in those Contract Years. If a new  
Contract is signed during a championship season to commence  
with the next championship season, the calculation called for in  
this paragraph (3) shall be performed at the end of the then cur-  
rent championship season. Except for the limited circumstances  
described in this paragraph (3), no Player may be signatory to  
more than one unexpired Uniform Player’s Contract at any time.  
Uses of Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  
Competitive Balance Tax proceeds collected pursuant to Section B(6)  
above shall be used as follows. Subsection H(1) sets forth the alloca-  
tion for Competitive Balance Tax proceeds from the 2016 Contract  
Year only. Subsection H(2) sets forth the allocation for Competitive  
Balance Tax proceeds from all other Contract Years during the term of  
the Basic Agreement.  
(1) 2016 Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  
(a) The first $2,375,400 of proceeds collected for the 2016 Con-  
tract Year shall be used to fund benefits to Players, as provided in  
the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan Agreements.  
(b) 50% of the remaining proceeds collected for the 2016 Con-  
tract Year, with accrued interest, shall be used to fund contributions  
129  
to the Players’ individual retirement accounts, as provided in the  
Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan Agreements.  
(c) The other 50% of the remaining proceeds collected for the  
2016 Contract Year, with accrued interest, shall be used to defray  
the Clubs’ funding obligations arising from the Major League Base-  
ball Players Benefit Plan Agreements.  
(2) 2017-21 Competitive Balance Tax Proceeds  
(a) The first $13 million of proceeds collected for each Contract  
Year shall be used to defray the Clubs’ funding obligations arising  
from the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan Agreements.  
(b) 50% of the remaining proceeds collected for each Contract  
Year, with accrued interest, shall be used to fund contributions to the  
Players’ individual retirement accounts, as provided in the Major  
League Baseball Players Benefit Plan Agreements.  
(c) The other 50% of the remaining proceeds collected for each  
Contract Year, with accrued interest, shall be provided to Clubs that  
did not exceed the Base Tax Threshold in that Contract Year.  
I. Sunset  
There shall be no Competitive Balance Tax in place following the 2021  
championship season, and the Parties expressly acknowledge and  
agree that the provisions of this Article XXIII (except those concern-  
ing the collection and distribution of the Competitive Balance Tax pro-  
ceeds for the 2021 Contract Year and the assessment of any associated  
penalties for exceeding the Base Tax or Surcharge Thresholds) shall  
not survive the expiration of this Agreement.  
ARTICLE XXIV—The Revenue Sharing Plan  
A. Definitions  
(1) “Financial Information Questionnaire,” or “FIQ,” shall mean  
the questionnaire completed by each of the Major League Clubs and  
submitted, together with audited financial statements, on an annual  
basis for each revenue sharing year to the Office of the Commis-  
sioner. From time to time, Clubs are also required by the Office of the  
130  
Commissioner to supplement the FIQ by submitting additional infor-  
mation in a “Supplementary Information Questionnaire” (“SIQ’’).  
(2) A “Revenue Sharing Year” shall mean the fiscal year of the  
championship season that falls in that year (and shall be referred to,  
for any specific Revenue Sharing Year under this Article, as “2017,”  
“2018,” “2019,” etc., or the “2017 Revenue Sharing Year,” the  
‘2018 Revenue Sharing Year,” etc.).  
(3) “Defined Gross Revenue” shall mean the aggregate operat-  
ing revenues from baseball operations received, or to be received on  
an accrual basis, as reported by each Club on an annual basis in the  
Club’s FIQ, but shall not include post-season revenue. “Baseball  
Operations” shall mean all activities of a Club that generate rev-  
enue, except those wholly unrelated to the business of Major League  
Baseball. Baseball Operations shall include (by way of example, but  
not by way of limitation):  
(a) an activity that could be conducted by a non-Club entity  
but which is conducted by a Club because its affiliation or con-  
nection with Major League Baseball increases the activity’s  
appeal; and  
(b) an activity from which revenue or value is received as a  
result of a decision or agreement to forego what otherwise would  
be Defined Gross Revenue.  
(4) “Central Revenue” shall mean all of the centrally-generated  
operating revenues of the Major League Clubs that are administered  
by the Office of the Commissioner or central baseball including, but  
not limited to, revenues from national and international broadcasting  
agreements (television, cable, radio and Internet), Major League Base-  
ball Properties Inc., MLB Advanced Media, L.P., The MLB Network,  
LLC, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the All-Star Game, and  
national marketing and licensing.  
(5) “Local Revenue” shall mean a Club’s Defined Gross Rev-  
enue less its share of Central Revenue.  
(6) “Actual Stadium Expenses” shall mean the “Stadium Opera-  
tions Expenses” of each Club, as reported on an annual basis in the  
Club’s FIQ.  
131  
(7) “Net Local Revenue” shall mean a Club’s Local Revenue  
less its Actual Stadium Expenses.  
(8) “Revenue Sharing Plan” or “Plan” shall mean the local rev-  
enue sharing agreement set forth in this Article XXIV, including the  
Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund.  
(9) The “Net Transfer Value” of the Revenue Sharing Plan for  
each Revenue Sharing Year shall be the total transfer value that  
would be generated by a 48% straight pool plan using the Clubs’ Net  
Local Revenue from the prior year (e.g., for the 2018 Revenue Shar-  
ing Year, the Net Transfer Value shall be the total transfer that would  
be generated by a 48% straight pool plan using the Clubs’ Net Local  
Revenue from 2017), without accounting for any distributions from  
the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund or adjustments due to the  
market disqualification mechanisms described in Section A(12)  
below.  
(10) “Revenue Sharing Formula” shall mean the portion of the  
Plan’s Net Transfer Value that Major League Clubs shall contribute  
or receive in each Revenue Sharing Year, based on the following  
formula:  
(a) Each Club shall contribute to a putative pool a percentage  
of a blended average of Net Local Revenue from the prior three  
Revenue Sharing Years as follows: (1) 50% of its Net Local Rev-  
enue from the prior Revenue Sharing Year; (11) 25% of its Net  
Local Revenue from the Revenue Sharing Year two years prior;  
and (111) 25% of its Net Local Revenue from the Revenue Shar-  
ing Year three years prior. The Club’s total contribution to the  
putative pool shall be referred to as the Club’s “Blended Net  
Local Revenue,” and the putative pool shall be referred to as the  
“Blended Net Local Revenue Pool.”  
(b) The Blended Net Local Revenue Pool shall be divided  
equally among the Clubs, with the difference between each  
Club’s payment into the Blended Net Local Revenue Pool and its  
receipt therefrom producing the Club’s net payment or net  
receipt. Each Club’s net payment or net receipt shall be expressed  
as a percentage of the total net transfer produced by the Blended  
Net Local Revenue Pool (“Transfer Percentage’’). Clubs’ Trans-  
132  
fer Percentages will be determined for each Revenue Sharing  
Year pursuant to the formula in this Section A(10).  
(c) For each Revenue Sharing Year, a Club’s Transfer Percent-  
age as calculated above shall be multiplied by the Net Transfer  
Value of the Plan for that Revenue Sharing Year as described in  
Section A(9) above to determine the Club’s payment or receipt  
for that Year. Clubs that pay more than they receive under the  
Revenue Sharing Plan shall be referred to as “Revenue Sharing  
Payor Clubs” and Clubs that receive more than they pay under  
the Revenue Sharing Plan shall be referred to as “Revenue Shar-  
ing Payee Clubs.”  
(d) For the 2017 Revenue Sharing Year only, the amount of a  
Club’s contribution or receipt under the Plan shall be the aver-  
age of: (1) the amount of the Club’s net payment or net receipt  
under the formula described in this Section A(10), and (11) the  
amount of the Club’s net payment or net receipt calculated as if  
the Revenue Sharing formula in effect during the 2016 Revenue  
Sharing Year remained in effect for the 2017 Revenue Sharing  
Year.  
(11) The “Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund” shall consist of  
no more than $15 million in Major League Central Fund money that  
is raised equally from all Clubs for each Revenue Sharing Year. The  
Commissioner may make distributions from the Commissioner’s  
Discretionary Fund to a Club or Clubs, in amounts and at times to  
be determined at the Commissioner’s discretion, subject to the fol-  
lowing guidelines and procedures.  
(a) Guidelines. The Commissioner, in exercising this discre-  
tion, shall take no action that is inconsistent with this Agreement.  
By way of example, but not limitation, the Commissioner may  
not consider: (1) positions that a Club has taken with respect to  
any matter before the Clubs, the Executive Council or the Office  
of the Commissioner; (11) a Club’s contracting decisions with  
respect to or contemplated offers to free agents or free agent eli-  
gible players; or (111) whether a Club’s Actual Club Payroll is or  
has been above the Competitive Balance Tax threshold estab-  
lished in Article XXIII, above. In addition, the Commissioner  
shall not, absent agreement of the Parties, distribute more than  
133  
$4 million to any individual Club in any Revenue Sharing Year  
or make more than one distribution to any Club with a Market  
Score of greater than 100 during the term of the Agreement.  
(b) Procedures.  
(1) Written Requests. Any Club seeking a distribution  
from the Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund shall submit a  
request in writing to the Commissioner. The written request  
must include, but need not be limited to: (1) the amount  
requested; (11) the use(s) to which the Club intends to put the  
requested distribution; and (111) an explanation of how, in the  
Club’s view, the requested distribution should improve the  
Club’s performance on the field. The Commissioner shall  
respond in writing to each request for a distribution from the  
Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund.  
(11) Consultation with the Association. The Commissioner  
shall, within 30 days of receiving a request pursuant to sub-  
paragraph (b)(1) above, provide to the Association a copy of  
the written request and his preliminary position on the request  
(e.g., inclined to grant, might consider if modified, or not  
inclined to grant). The Commissioner shall, at the Associa-  
tion’s request, consult with the Association prior to making  
any distribution. At the Association’s request, the Commis-  
sioner shall also consult with the Association regarding a  
request that he is not inclined to grant in its current form. The  
Commissioner shall give notice to the Association at least 15  
days prior to making any distribution, unless such notice is not  
possible under the circumstances. In such case, the Commis-  
sioner shall provide as much notice to the Association as is  
possible under these circumstances, but, in no event, shall any  
distribution be made without at least five (5) days’ written  
notice to the Association. As part of any such consultation  
process, the Commissioner shall provide the Association with  
the documents required to be produced pursuant to Section  
D(2)(k) of this Article and any document reasonably requested  
by the Association pursuant to Section D(2).  
Timing of Distributions. The Commissioner shall  
attempt to make distributions for a given Revenue Sharing  
Year no later than December 1. The Commissioner may make  
134  
distributions that are contingent on a Club’s satisfaction of  
specified conditions and may carry over funds to the next Rev-  
enue Sharing Year if the money is not distributed because the  
conditions were not fulfilled.  
(12) Clubs with a Market Score greater than 100, as reflected in  
Attachment 26, shall be fully disqualified from receiving revenue  
sharing in the 2017-21 Revenue Sharing Years, except as set forth in  
Section A(11) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the revenue  
sharing disqualification of the Oakland Athletics shall be phased in  
as follows: 25% disqualified in the 2017 Revenue Sharing Year; 50%  
disqualified in the 2018 Revenue Sharing Year; 75% disqualified in  
the 2019 Revenue Sharing Year; and fully disqualified in the 2020  
and 2021 Revenue Sharing Years. However, the Oakland Athletics  
shall be considered a market-disqualified Club for purposes of sub-  
paragraphs 12(a) and (b) below, beginning in 2017.  
(a) Distribution of Market Disqualification Proceeds: Except  
as provided by subparagraph 12(b) below, revenue sharing pro-  
ceeds forfeited by market-disqualified Clubs by operation of this  
Section A(12) shall be refunded to Revenue Sharing Payor Clubs.  
Revenue Sharing Payor Clubs shall receive a share of forfeited  
proceeds in proportion to their paid share of the Net Transfer  
Value for a given Revenue Sharing Year (referred to as the Club’s  
“Market Disqualification  
(b) Forfeiture of Market Disqualification Refund: Notwith-  
standing subparagraph 12(a) above, a Revenue Sharing Payor  
Club may forfeit some or all of its Market Disqualification Refund  
in a Revenue Sharing Year if its Actual Club Payroll during the  
same Contract Year exceeds the Base Tax Threshold under Article  
XXIII (“CBT Payor Club’’). The percentage of the Market Dis-  
qualification Refund that a CBT Payor Club shall forfeit, if any,  
will be determined by the number of consecutive Contract Years  
that it had been a CBT Payor Club, as set forth below and regard-  
less of whether the consecutive Contract Years fell within the term  
of this or the immediately preceding Basic Agreement. Revenue  
Sharing Payor Clubs shall receive their full Market Disqualifica-  
tion Refund in any year in which they are not a CBT Payor Club  
even if they were a CBT Payor Club in prior Contract Years.  
135  
(1) Tier 1: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall receive  
100% of its Market Disqualification Refund if it is a CBT  
Payor Club during the Contract Year at issue but was not a  
CBT Payor Club in the immediately preceding Contract Year.  
(11) Tier 2: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  
25% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the Con-  
tract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a second consec-  
utive Contract Year.  
(111) Tier 3: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  
50% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the Con-  
tract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a third consecu-  
tive Contract Year.  
(iv) Tier 4: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  
75% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the Con-  
tract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a fourth consec-  
utive Contract Year.  
(v) Tier 5: A Revenue Sharing Payor Club shall forfeit  
100% of its Market Disqualification Refund if, during the  
Contract Year at issue, it is a CBT Payor Club for a fifth (or  
more) consecutive Contract Year.  
(vi) Initial Assignment of Tier: For purposes of determin-  
ing a Club’s Tier for the 2017 Revenue Sharing Year—  
(A) A Club that was not a 2016 CBT Payor Club is a  
Tier 1 Club if it is a CBT Payor Club in 2017.  
(B) A Club that was not a 2015 CBT Payor Club but was  
a 2016 CBT Payor Club is a Tier 2 Club if it is a CBT Payor  
Club in 2017.  
(C) A Club that was a CBT Payor Club in 2016 for the  
second consecutive Contract Year is a Tier 3 Club if itis a  
CBT Payor Club in 2017.  
(D) A Club that was a CBT Payor Club in 2016 for the  
third consecutive Contract Year is a Tier 4 Club if it is a  
CBT Payor Club in 2017.  
136  
(E) A Club that was a CBT Payor Club in 2016 for the  
fourth (or more) consecutive Contract Year is a Tier 5 Club  
if 1t is a CBT Payor Club in 2017.  
(vii) Subsequent Assignment of Tier:  
(A) A Club will move up one Tier for each consecutive  
Contract Year it remains a CBT Payor Club.  
(B) A Club that is a CBT Payor Club in a given Contract  
Year but is not a CBT Payor Club for the next two or more  
consecutive Contract Years will be a Tier 1 Club in the next  
Contract Year in which it is a CBT Payor Club.  
(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sub-  
paragraphs b(1)-(v) above, a Club that is a CBT Payor Club  
in a given Contract Year but is not a CBT Payor Club for  
only the next Contract Year will have its assigned Tier  
reduced by two levels (but in no event to lower than Tier 1)  
in the next Contract Year in which it is a CBT Payor Club.  
For example, a Club that is at Tier 5 entering the 2018 Rev-  
enue Sharing Year but is not a CBT Payor Club in 2018 will  
receive its full Market Disqualification Refund in 2018, and  
will be a Tier 3 Club if it is a CBT Payor Club in 2019.  
(viii) Distribution of Forfeited Refunds: Amounts for-  
feited in a given Revenue Sharing Year by operation of this  
subparagraph 12(b) shall be redistributed as follows.  
(A) 50% of forfeited amounts shall be used to fund  
benefits to Players via the Major League Baseball Players  
Investment Plan.  
(B) 50% of forfeited amounts shall be distributed  
to Revenue Sharing Payee Clubs, excluding market-  
disqualified Clubs, that either are not CBT Payor Clubs in  
the given Contract Year or are CBT Payor Clubs in the  
given Contract Year but were not CBT Payor Clubs in the  
immediately preceding Contract Year. Such distributions  
shall be made to the qualifying Revenue Sharing Payee  
Clubs in proportion to the amount of revenue sharing pro-  
ceeds they received.  
137  
(13) The “Administrator” shall be the representative (or repre-  
sentatives) responsible, in consultation with the Association, for  
administration of the Revenue Sharing Plan under this Article  
XXIV. (See Section C, Administration, below.)  
B. General Principles  
(1) Intent of the Plan  
The intent of the Revenue Sharing Plan is to transfer among the  
Clubs in each Revenue Sharing Year the amount of revenue that  
would have been transferred in that Year by a 48% straight pool  
plan, plus such transfers as may result from distributions of the  
Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund.  
(2) Other Sharing  
Except as expressly provided for in the Basic Agreement or other  
agreements between the Parties, nothing in this Article is intended  
to alter current agreements among the Clubs pertaining to Central  
Revenue, including but not limited to the Major League Central  
Fund, the Office of the Commissioner, Major League Baseball  
Properties, Inc., Major League Baseball Advanced Media, L.P., The  
MLB Network, LLC, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, the  
All-Star Game, and national marketing and licensing. Notwithstand-  
ing the preceding sentence and except as expressly provided for in  
the Basic Agreement or other agreements between the Parties, the  
Office of the Commissioner shall take no action regarding the allo-  
cation or distribution of Central Revenue that is (1) in response to  
the operation of the Revenue Sharing Plan or (11) inconsistent with  
the manner in which the Commissioner has allocated or distributed  
Central Revenue in the past.  
(3) Accounting Rules  
In calculating net payments and net receipts, the Administrator,  
on behalf of the Clubs, shall use the definitions contained in the  
2016 FIQ, subject to the provisions of Section C below. The inten-  
tion is to continue to follow Generally Accepted Accounting Princi-  
ples (“the GAAP rules’’) in the adoption and application of revenue  
and expense definitions contained in the FIQ and to use GAAP or,  
in designated situations, federal tax principles, as the “default” stan-  
138  
dards in the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected  
in the FIQ (and in any changes to any of the foregoing). It is  
acknowledged, however, that specific exceptions to the GAAP rules  
have been and will be warranted to ensure uniformity, consistency  
and fair treatment among the Clubs, subject to the provisions of Sec-  
tion C, below.  
(4) Interests of the Association  
The Revenue Sharing Plan may have a significant impact on the  
industry globally as well as on individual Clubs. Accordingly, the  
Parties acknowledge that the Association has a significant interest in  
any aspect of any of the components of the Revenue Sharing Plan  
or its operation materially affecting either: (a) the overall industry-  
wide transfer of revenue among Clubs; or (b) the amounts of pay-  
ments made by individual Clubs and the amounts of receipts  
received by individual Clubs. This paragraph shall not be construed  
to limit the Association’s right to assert that it has other legitimate  
interests in the operation of the Plan.  
(5) Other Undertakings  
(a) A principal objective of the Revenue Sharing Plan is to pro-  
mote the growth of the Game and the industry on an individual Club  
and on an aggregate basis. Accordingly, each Club shall use its rev-  
enue sharing receipts (including any distributions from the Commis-  
sioner’s Discretionary Fund) in an effort to improve its performance  
on the field. The following uses of revenue sharing receipts are not  
consistent with a Club’s obligation under this paragraph 5(a) to use  
such receipts in an effort to improve its performance on the field:  
payments to service acquisition debt or any other debt that is unre-  
lated to past or future efforts to improve performance on the field;  
payments to individuals other than on-field personnel or personnel  
related to player development; payments to entities that do not have  
a direct role in improving on-field performance; and distributions to  
ownership that are not intended to offset tax obligations resulting  
from Club operations. Consistent with his authority under the Major  
League Constitution, the Commissioner may impose penalties on  
any Club that fails to comply with this subparagraph 5(a). The Com-  
missioner, in addition to other penalties he may impose for violations  
of any aspect of this subparagraph 5(a), may require a Club to sub-  
139  
mit a plan for its financial performance and competitive effort for the  
next two years. Such a plan must include a pro forma financial pres-  
entation that specifies its attendance, revenues, payroll, player devel-  
opment expenditures, non-player costs, and capital spending. The  
Commissioner, after consultation with the Players Association, may  
direct the Club to change aspects of its plan, including the level of  
competitive effort reflected in the plan, or take other actions as he  
considers appropriate (including escrow of a portion of a Club’s rev-  
enue sharing payments).  
The Association has the burden in any proceeding under the Griev-  
ance Procedure of demonstrating that the Club’s use of its revenue  
sharing receipts was in violation of this subparagraph S(a). In any  
such Grievance, the Arbitration Panel shall consider, among other  
things: (1) the Club’s expenditures on scouting, player development,  
and player payroll; (11) the Club’s long-term strategy for improving  
competitiveness; (111) the uses that the Club has historically made of  
revenue sharing receipts; and (iv) the overall financial position of the  
Club. Notwithstanding the above, if a Club’s Actual Club Payroll pur-  
suant to Article XXIII(C) is equal to less than 125% of its revenue  
sharing receipts in a given Revenue Sharing Year, the Club shall have  
the burden of establishing in any Grievance that its use of revenue  
sharing receipts was consistent with this subparagraph 5(a).  
(b) Each Revenue Sharing Payee Club, no later than August 15,  
shall report on the performance-related uses to which it put its rev-  
enue sharing receipts in the current Revenue Sharing Year. That  
report shall include, in a single submission: a statement of the  
Club’s strategy for competitive improvement, aggregate revenues,  
payroll, non-payroll costs, and operating profits, both planned and  
actual, over the recent past and projected for at least two years; pro-  
vided that the aforementioned financial data may be generated by  
the Office of the Commissioner for inclusion in the submission.  
(c) The Clubs and the Association recognize that the participa-  
tion of two Clubs is necessary for the production of the on-field  
competition that the Clubs sell to the public. The net payments and  
net receipts required by this Article XXIV reflect a continuation of  
the amounts paid directly to the visiting Clubs and are in recogni-  
tion of the principle that visiting Clubs should share, and in fact tra-  
140  
ditionally have shared, in the economic benefits jointly generated by  
the Game at another Club’s home field.  
(d) None of the Parties hereto shall enter into any agreement, or  
engage in any transaction or other conduct, designed to defeat or cir-  
cumvent the intentions of the Parties as reflected in this Article  
XXIV.  
C. Administration  
(1) Responsibility  
The administration of the Revenue Sharing Plan under this Arti-  
cle XXIV shall be the responsibility of the Administrator in consul-  
tation with the Association. The Administrator shall be the  
Commissioner or, if so designated by the Major League Baseball  
Executive Council, a Committee of Clubs and/or representatives.  
The Administrator may delegate certain of his duties and responsi-  
bilities to his staff and/or a committee of Club representatives  
and/or expert consultants (e.g., the Revenue Sharing Definitions  
Committee), provided that the Administrator retains final decision-  
making authority over all matters within his jurisdiction and subject  
to the Players Association’s rights (as set forth herein). The Office  
of the Commissioner shall promptly notify the Association of a  
change in the Administrator.  
(2) Duties of Administrator  
The Administrator shall have the following duties and responsi-  
bilities, to be performed in consultation with the Association:  
(a) Calculations and Determination of Payment Schedule.  
The Administrator shall calculate and determine the timing of  
payment and distribution of net payments and net receipts by (or  
to) Clubs. In this regard, the Administrator is authorized to  
require estimated partial payments and distributions during the  
course of a Revenue Sharing Year and to assess reasonable penal-  
ties for intentionally inaccurate estimates by Clubs. Unless  
altered by the Administrator in consultation with the Association,  
the Clubs shall make payments to the Administrator in each year  
of the Revenue Sharing Plan under the following schedule:

yea Onowing ¥ on Audited Results  
(1) For Payments 1 — 4, payment amounts shall be deter-  
mined using the most recent Net Local Revenue estimates pro-  
vided by Clubs as of October 25 of the previous year.  
(11) The “Payment Date” shall be the date on which the  
Revenue Sharing Payor Clubs pay estimated amounts to the  
Administrator based on an updated revenue sharing calcula-  
tion provided to the Clubs.  
(111) The “Distribution Date” shall be the latest date by  
which the Administrator should distribute estimated amounts  
to Revenue Sharing Payee Clubs based on the updated revenue  
sharing calculation.  
(iv) The “Estimated Annual Net Payment” shall include  
any Market Disqualification Refunds distributed pursuant to  
Section A(12)(a) above, but shall not account for any Market  
Disqualification Refunds forfeited pursuant to Section  
A(12)(b).  
(v) The “Final Determination of Annual Net Payment  
Based on Audited Results” shall include any forfeited Market  
Disqualification Refunds.  
   
In determining whether to alter the foregoing schedule, the  
Administrator shall accord substantial weight to the cash flow  
needs under this Agreement of the industry as a whole, as  
opposed to any specific Club. The Administrator shall also pro-  
vide the Association with notice of any inter-Club disputes relat-  
142  
ing to the payment and distribution of net payments and receipts  
and the resolution of such disputes.  
The Commissioner’s Discretionary Fund shall operate as pro-  
vided in Section A(11), above.  
(b) Review of Accounting and Reporting Practices. The  
Administrator shall review the accounting and reporting practices of  
the Clubs, as reflected in Club financial information submitted in  
connection with the FIQs, audited financial statements, and any  
SIQs or supplemental information required by the Administrator to  
be submitted by Clubs. The Administrator shall also conduct regu-  
lar full independent audits of the Clubs and of particular significant  
transactions (e.g., related party transactions). The Administrator will  
continue to conduct full compliance audits of each Club in each year  
of this Agreement. The Administrator is also authorized to make  
appropriate changes, in furtherance of the objectives described  
below in Section C(2)(c), in the definitions, accounting conven-  
tions, policies or practices reflected in the FIQ, subject to prior  
notice to, and consultation with, the Association. The Administrator  
is also authorized to require a more detailed Club submission of line  
items as set out in the FIQ.  
(c) Objectives. In performing functions under this paragraph  
(2), the objectives of the Administrator are:  
(1) to achieve uniformity and consistency in reporting  
among Clubs;  
(11) to achieve uniformity and consistency in reporting from  
Revenue Sharing Year to Revenue Sharing Year;  
(111) to accord fair treatment in the calculation of net pay-  
ments and net receipts;  
(iv) to be fair, impartial and objective in assessing and eval-  
uating new issues that arise in the operation of the Plan; and  
(v) to remain faithful to the agreement of the Parties  
reflected in this Article XXIV.  
(3) Specific Prohibition  
In performing duties and responsibilities in the administration of  
the Revenue Sharing Plan, the Administrator shall not materially  
143  
affect the agreement of the Parties as reflected in this Article,  
including, but not limited to:  
(a) the industry-wide net transfer of Net Local Revenue  
among Clubs;  
(b) the amounts of contributions made by individual Revenue  
Sharing Payor Clubs and the amounts of payments received by  
individual Revenue Sharing Payee Clubs; or  
(c) the amounts distributed under the Commissioner’s Discre-  
tionary Fund.  
D. Participation of the Association  
(1) Consultation  
(a) Within 30 days following execution of this Agreement, the  
Administrator shall promptly notify and consult with the Association  
in advance with regard to any proposed action the Administrator  
intends to take pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2)(a) and (2)(b) of Section  
C above in connection with the administration of the Revenue Shar-  
ing Plan. The Administrator and the Association shall thereafter meet  
regularly on a monthly basis to facilitate administration of the Plan.  
Further, the Administrator shall regularly notify and consult with the  
Association with respect to any proposed changes described in Sec-  
tion C(2)(b), or any other proposed changes in the administration of  
the Plan, preliminary and final estimated partial payment calcula-  
tions and preliminary and final calculations regarding net payments  
or net receipts due under any component of the Plan.  
(b) Failure by the Association to challenge at the consultation  
stage with the Administrator or under the Grievance Procedure in  
Article XI any such proposed actions, changes, or preliminary esti-  
mated partial payment calculations or preliminary calculations  
regarding net payments or net receipts described above in Section  
D(1)(a) shall not preclude the Association from challenging under  
the Grievance Procedure in Article XI any action taken, changes  
made, or final estimated partial payment calculations or final calcu-  
lations regarding net payments or net receipts made by the Admin-  
istrator in connection with the administration of the Revenue  
Sharing Plan. Further, nothing in this Article, including, but not lim-  
144  
ited to, the consultation rights accorded the Association, is intended  
to limit either the substantive rights of the Association under this  
Article or the application of the Grievance Procedure in Article XI  
as to any complaint involving the existence or interpretation of, or

provides otherwise. Unless the Chair provides otherwise, any  
adjustments to the calculation, collection or redistribution of esti-  
mated partial payments or receipts or of final net payments or  
receipts pursuant to this Article necessitated by the resolution of an  
Association Grievance shall be made by the Administrator once the

(3) Right to Audit  
(a) The Association shall have the right, at any time during this  
Agreement, to require the Administrator to conduct a full or partial  
independent audit of any Club for a given Revenue Sharing Year or  
of any particular transaction, regardless of whether such an audit  
would have been required by the Administrator under the proce-  
dures referred to in Section C(2)(b) above. Further, should the Asso-  
ciation require such an audit, the Association shall also have the  
right to require the Administrator to examine specified transactions,  
revenue and/or expense items, and/or to require reconciliation of the  
Club’s FIQ and audited financial statements in specified areas. The  
Association also shall have the right to require the Administrator to  
examine specified Club document(s). The Administrator shall con-  
duct the audit within a reasonable period of time from the date of a  
written demand therefor by the Association. To the extent practica-  
147  
ble, such audit will be conducted under the same procedures and  
under the same time schedule as other audits conducted by the  
Administrator in accordance with Section C(2)(b) above. All  
expenses for such audits shall be borne solely by the Administrator.  
(b) Upon a showing of good cause and written notice to the  
Administrator, the Association shall have the right to conduct its own  
full or partial independent audit of any such Club or transaction. The  
Administrator shall promptly arrange the date for the Association’s  
audit, to be conducted within a reasonable period of time from the  
date of the Association’s notice pursuant to this subparagraph.  
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section C(2)(b), Section  
D(3)(a) and Section D(3)(b) above, and without regard to whether  
the Administrator has conducted an audit pursuant to Section  
C(2)(b) or Section D(3)(a) of any Club (or Clubs), the Association,  
upon written notice to the Administrator, shall have the right to con-  
duct its own full or partial independent audit of six (6) Clubs per  
year for each Revenue Sharing Year. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  
upon a showing of good cause, the Association shall have the right  
to conduct its own full or partial independent audit of more than six  
(6) Clubs for each Revenue Sharing Year. The Administrator shall  
promptly arrange the date for the Association’s audit, to be con-  
ducted within a reasonable period of time from the date of the Asso-  
ciation’s notice pursuant to this subparagraph.  
(d) Any audits conducted by the Association pursuant to sub-  
paragraphs (b) or (c) above, may be conducted by representatives of  
the Association’s choice, including accountant(s) employed on the  
Association’s staff, so long as such representatives are working  
under the supervision of Certified Public Accountant(s) of the Asso-  
ciation’s choice.  
(e) The Association shall utilize the rights set forth in this para-  
graph (3) in good faith and only in furtherance of its interest in  
ensuring compliance with this Agreement. In no event will the  
Association conduct an unreasonable number of its own audits for  
any Revenue Sharing Year.  
(4) Confidentiality  
Any financial information obtained by the Association from  
the Clubs (or the Administrator) pursuant to this Article shall  
148  
be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement appended hereto in  
Attachment 14.  
ARTICLE XXV—International Play  
A. Definition  
International Play is defined as any baseball-related tour, game, clinic  
or competition, including skills competition, initiated by either party,  
or by a Player, that involves Players and that is staged (“International  
Play Event” or “Event’’):  
(1) outside the United States and Canada; or  
(2) within or without the United States or Canada against a for-  
eign club or clubs.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, International Play shall not include:  
(a) Championship season, All-Star, Wild Card, Division  
Series, League Championship Series and World Series games  
played in the United States and/or Canada; and  
(b) Exhibition games conducted in the United States or  
Canada contained in the Spring Training schedule against any  
non-Major League club provided the following conditions are  
satisfied: (1) the Office of the Commissioner shall give the Asso-  
ciation written notice of each such exhibition game on or before  
February | of each year during the term of the Basic Agreement,  
(11) the games are scheduled as split squad games with all 40-man  
roster Players being afforded the opportunity to play in the alter-  
nate game if they choose; (111) a Club may not schedule more than  
two such exhibition games in any Spring Training period; (iv) no  
more than 25% of participating Players in the game are on the 40-  
man roster; and (v) the games are not organized, staged or spon-  
sored by the Office of the Commissioner, MLB Properties or any  
of their affiliated entities. The Office of the Commissioner will  
provide to the Association a list of the 40-man roster Players who  
have agreed to participate in any such exhibition games no later  
than thirty-six hours before the start of the applicable game.  
B. Possible Expansion  
Notwithstanding the foregoing definition of International Play, if a  
Major League franchise is awarded to a city outside the United States  
149  
and Canada, all championship season, All-Star, Wild Card, Division  
Series, League Championship Series and World Series games played in  
that city by such franchise shall not be considered International Play.  
C. Staging of International Play Events  
The Parties have agreed to stage the International Play Events set forth  
in Attachment 51 during the term of the Basic Agreement. Once Clubs  
are selected to participate in an International Play Event pursuant to the  
procedures set forth below, the Event will be staged. Notwithstanding  
the preceding sentence, either party may propose modifications to an  
International Play Event contemplated in Attachment 51 (which will  
be considered in good faith, but need not be accepted, by the other  
party); provided, however, that any such proposed modifications must  
be presented to the other party by no later than July 1| in the year pre-  
ceding the Event in question and the Parties must finalize any agreed-  
upon modifications by no later than September | in the year preceding  
the Event. Further, a party may unilaterally cancel an Event, no later  
than September | in the year preceding the Event in question, if: (1) the  
participation agreement with the Event promoter or sponsor has not  
been executed; and (11) the party has a reasonable basis for withdraw-  
ing from the Event under this subsection that was not foreseeable as of  
December 1, 2016.  
D. Club Selection and Reimbursement for International  
Play Events  
(1) Events in Mexico, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic.  
For each Spring Training or championship season Event in Mex-  
ico, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic, the Office of the Com-  
missioner shall notify the Association in writing which Clubs have  
been selected to participate in the Event by no later than April 1 in  
the year preceding the Event.  
(2) Championship Season Events in Asia or the United Kingdom.  
As early as March | two years prior to the staging of any  
championship season Event in Asia or the United Kingdom, but no  
later than March | in the year preceding such an Event, the Office  
of the Commissioner will provide the Association with a list of at  
least four Clubs that are interested in participating in the Event. The  
150  
Association will then survey the Players on those Clubs to deter-  
mine their interest in participating in the Event. During this survey  
and consultation period, Club personnel shall be prohibited from  
lobbying or attempting to persuade or dissuade Players from partic-  
ipating in the Event. Within thirty days of receiving the list of poten-  
tial Clubs from the Office of the Commissioner, the Association will  
identify from that list at least two Clubs from the same League that  
the Association approves for participation in the Event. The Office  
of the Commissioner shall then select the two participating Clubs  
from those approved by the Association.  
(3) Off-season Exhibition/Barnstorming Tours.  
The Parties will endeavor to organize at least one exhibition tour  
involving Players in a foreign country (or countries) each offseason,  
scheduled between the end of the World Series and the start of  
Spring Training.  
(4) Limits on the Number of International Play Events Per Club.  
(a) A Club may not be selected to participate in more than two  
International Play Events during the term of the Basic Agree-  
ment, no more than one of which will be outside of Mexico, the  
Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico.  
(b) All Players on a Club selected to participate in Events  
scheduled during the championship season will be required to  
participate, regardless of whether such Players participated in an  
International Play Event during the term of the Basic Agreement  
while a member of another Club.  
(5) Club Reimbursement for Replacement Costs.  
Clubs that have one or more home games replaced by an Interna-  
tional Play Event shall be compensated for lost revenue as follows:  
(a) The replacement costs of home Clubs will be calculated  
using the average game day revenue for three comparable games  
minus the average variable expenses for such games.  
(b) Revenue categories will include gate receipts, in-park con-  
cessions, advertising and publications, parking, and suite revenue.  
(c) Variable expense categories will include stadium opera-  
tions costs, utilities costs, maintenance costs, and game opera-  
151  
tions staff salaries that are paid by the Club on a per-game or as-  
used basis.  
(d) Participating Clubs shall provide the Office of the Com-  
missioner and the Association with detailed and complete state-  
ments reflecting replacement cost calculations.  
(ce) Replacement costs that Clubs receive for participating in  
an Event shall be excluded from Net Local Revenue under  
Article XXIV.  
E. Promoter Selection and Logistics for International Play  
Events  
(1) The Office of the Commissioner shall be responsible for  
selecting and negotiating contracts with promoters for International  
Play Events. Such promoters, as well as any event staff that are not  
full-time MLB employees, shall be subject to the prior written  
approval of the Association, which shall not be unreasonably with-  
held.  
(2) The Office of the Commissioner shall consult with the Asso-  
ciation prior to entering into any contract that affects the terms and  
conditions of Player participation in an Event (including travel,  
hotel selection, promotional activities involving Players), and pro-  
vide copies of all final agreements to the Association. Association  
staff shall be involved in making all travel and accommodations  
arrangements for any Event.  
(3) During the planning and execution of an Event, the Parties  
shall meet and confer at least twice per month for purposes of shar-  
ing information and seeking input. The Office of the Commissioner  
and the Association will each designate a single point person to  
coordinate with one another in between these bi-monthly meetings.  
F. Promotional Activity and International Ambassadors  
(1) Promotional Activities  
(a) No later than 90 days before each scheduled Event (or  
some other reasonable notice period to be agreed upon by the  
Parties), the Office of the Commissioner shall provide to the  
Association a plan to promote the Event and related activities.  
152  
(b) Each Player who participates in an Event shall be encour-  
aged to promote the Event, including by participating in at least  
two large-group activities and one smaller-group promotional  
activity. Media availability at the ballpark shall not be counted  
toward these promotional activities. No Player shall be required,  
without his consent, to participate in any appearance or activity  
to promote an Event sponsor or promoter.  
(c) At least 60 days prior to each Event, the Association will  
identify a group of no less than four Players from each Club (not  
including any International Ambassadors, as described below)  
who will engage in one group activity or appearance to promote  
the Event.  
(d) Promoter agreements for Events shall include a provision  
that allows the Office of the Commissioner to request that a  
Player make no more than one commercial appearance on behalf  
of an Event sponsor or promoter at a time and place convenient  
for the Player, with a predetermined appearance fee of $5,000.  
The agreement shall include as many details as possible regard-  
ing expectations of the Player for the projected/anticipated pro-  
motional event(s), and make clear to the promoter that Player  
participation in any commercially sponsored activity is voluntary.  
In addition, the Parties shall jointly discuss other voluntary com-  
mercial opportunities for Players on behalf of Event sponsors or  
promoters in connection with each Event.  
(e) Any agreement on promotion will be circulated as soon as  
reasonably practicable to the Association.  
(f) The Association shall be a party to any promotional agree-  
ments with third parties (not the Event promoter) that contem-  
plate the involvement of Players. If the Office of the  
Commissioner or a Club is approached about such promotional  
arrangements (including through an Event promoter), it shall  
direct inquiries to the Association. The Association agrees not to  
be a party to promotional agreements with third parties to partic-  
ipate in events that are scheduled at the same time as promotional  
activities reasonably scheduled by the Event promoter that all or  
substantially all Players are requested to attend.  
(g) The Office of the Commissioner and the Association shall  
jointly discuss voluntary commercial opportunities for Players,  
153  
provided that any voluntary opportunities are made clear in the  
promoter agreement.  
(2) International Ambassadors. For all Events, at least two  
active Players from each Club will be chosen by the Association as  
International Ambassadors. International Ambassadors may be  
asked to participate in promotional services in advance of an Event,  
such as appearances, press conferences, sponsor events, and other  
similar events. Player compensation will be provided in an amount  
agreed upon by the Parties from the International Play Bank  
Account (see Attachment 51), subject to projected available funds.  
G. Player Participation in Off-Season and Spring Training  
Events  
(1) Player participation in off-season Events will be purely vol-  
untary; however, the Association will encourage Player participa-  
tion in these Events. The Office of the Commissioner will  
encourage Clubs to give consent for their Players to participate in  
these Events.  
(2) For all purposes herein, permission for Player participation  
may not be conditioned on any third party or sponsor-related activ-  
ity involving the Player (directly or indirectly).  
(3) All Players on a Club will not be required to participate in an  
International Play Event scheduled during Spring Training provided  
that a representative complement of Players on the Club participate  
in the event.  
H. Off-Season Promotion  
For all Events, the Parties shall explore promotional activities using  
current Players during the off-season preceding an Event (including by  
using International Ambassadors, as described above), as well as ama-  
teur development programming using former Players after an Event  
(e.g., instructional clinics). Compensation for International Ambas-  
sadors and former Players will be jointly determined by the Office of  
the Commissioner and the Association.

ment be reopened pursuant to the provisions hereof, each of the Parties

It is further agreed by the Parties that during the term of this Agree-  
ment they will use their best efforts to ensure that all terms and condi-  
tions of all Uniform Player’s Contracts signed by individual Players

ARTICLE XXVII—Execution of this Agreement  
This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each  
of which shall be deemed an original, and such counterparts shall con-  
stitute but one and the same instrument.

their respective representative capacities and not in their individual  
capacities.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have hereunto subscribed their

Dear Tony:  
I understand that the Players Association has expressed concern that  
the Commissioner might take some action pursuant to Article  
XI(A)(1)(b) of the Basic Agreement which could negate rights of Play-  
ers under the new Basic Agreement. While I have difficulty seeing that  
this is a real problem, I am quite willing to assure the Association that  
the Commissioner will take no such action.  
Sincerely,

Dear David:  
This letter is to confirm our agreement that when a Club assigns a  
Player to the Minor Leagues by either an optional or outright assign-  
ment, or designates a Player for assignment from the status of an  
optioned Player, before Opening Day Rosters are due for that Club,  
that Player shall not be credited with Major League Service for Open-  
ing Day or during the period of designation. In addition, written notice  
of the date and time that Opening Day Rosters for the following  
championship season are due will be annually provided by the Com-  
missioner’s Office to the Players Association on or before the March |  
preceding the applicable Opening Day.  
Very truly yours,

Dear Dan:  
As we have agreed, in cases in which the Arbitration Panel decides that  
an award including interest is appropriate, the interest rate to be applied  
shall be as calculated under Article XV(K) of the Basic Agreement.  
In addition, if a Player is credited with additional Major League Ser-  
vice, due to any agreement or Panel award, for any year in which Arti-  
cle XXIII Contributions are made (see Section 8.1(e) of the Major  
League Baseball Players Benefit Plan), the Player will receive addi-  
tional Article XXIII Contributions, if possible, based on that newly  
credited service. Such contributions will be made even in the absence  
of a specific direction in the agreement or award.  
This letter shall not be admissible in an arbitration hearing for any pur-  
pose other than the calculation of an appropriate interest rate, or the  
allocation of a Player’s Article XXIII Contribution based on an award  
or agreement crediting a Player with additional Major League Service  
days.

Re:  
Agent Regulations Information  
Dear Dan:  
This letter will confirm our agreement on the Parties’ information  
sharing obligations with regard to certain investigations that may  
arise under the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program (the  
“Program’’) and/or the Major League Baseball Players Association’s  
Regulations Governing Player Agents (the “Agent  
1.  
Section 5(B)(21) of the Agent Regulations prohibits certified  
agents from providing or assisting any player in obtaining any  
substance that 1s banned under the Program, and also prohibits  
any other conduct that could subject a player to discipline under  
the Program. In the event of a Players Association investigation  
into a potential violation of Section 5(B)(21), or fraudulent con-  
duct meant to conceal a violation of Section 5(B)(21), the Com-  
missioner’s Office and Players Association will meet to discuss  
the results of the investigation promptly after the later of: (a) the  
conclusion of the investigation; (b) the issuance of discipline to  
the agent(s) in question; (c) the resolution of any appeal that  
arises under the Agent Regulations; or (d) the resolution of any  
related appeal that arises under the Program.  
The information to be shared at a meeting conducted under Para-  
graph | of this agreement shall include a recitation of the perti-  
nent factual findings, if any. In addition, in the event an agent’s

Re:  
Charitable Contributions  
Dear David:  
I am writing to confirm certain understandings we have reached with  
respect to special covenants in the Uniform Player’s Contract (“UPC”)  
that provide for player contributions to charities that are affiliated with  
the Club.  
Players and Clubs may only include special covenants in UPCs exe-  
cuted after the date of this Agreement that require a Player to make a  
contribution to a Club’s charitable foundation or charity if each of the  
following criteria 1s met:  
I.  
The UPC is for a Player who has Major League service at or  
above the threshold for obtaining arbitration eligibility under Arti-  
cle VI(E) in the prior season;  
The UPC is “guaranteed” and covers more than one season, not  
including any option years;  
The special covenant provides for a maximum annual charitable  
contribution of 1% of the Player’s annual salary or such other  
amount up to a maximum aggregate contribution over the term of  
the contract of 1% of the player’s total guaranteed salary;  
The special covenant provides the Player with the option of fund-  
ing the contribution to the charitable foundation through a payroll  
deduction, personal check, or some other mutually acceptable  
payment method;  
The special covenant provides that 50% of the annual Player con-  
tribution be directed to the Club’s charitable foundation for use at  
the foundation’s discretion, and that the other 50% be directed to  
the Club’s charitable foundation for distribution to charities to be  
mutually agreed upon by the Player and the Club, with the under-  
185  
standing that the majority of the latter contribution will be allo-  
cated to charities within the metropolitan area of the Club absent  
an agreement otherwise;  
6. The special covenant, including any obligation on behalf of the  
Player to make a charitable contribution that has not yet accrued,  
will have no force and effect if the Player’s UPC 1s assigned to  
another Major League Club or if the Player is unconditionally  
released; and  
7. The charitable contribution special covenant(s) was negotiated on  
an individual basis and is not part of an across-the-board Club or  
Commissioner’s Office policy requiring all eligible players to  
make charitable contributions.  
A special covenant providing for a charitable contribution may be con-  
sidered by the Arbitration Panel in any grievance involving a determi-  
nation of whether a Player has complied with his obligations under  
paragraph 3(b) of his UPC.  
A Club will supply to any player who has made, or is scheduled to  
make, a contractually-required charitable contribution to a Club-spon-  
sored foundation or charity, an annual accounting of the uses of his  
contributions and the most recent audit report for the foundation or  
charity.  
With respect to any Major League contracts that contain a charitable  
contribution provision and were signed prior to the effective date of the  
new Basic Agreement, the terms of the January 15, 2010 settlement  
agreement shall continue to govern.  
Very truly yours,

Dear Tony:  
The Players Association has consistently maintained that a centralized  
effort by the Office of the Commissioner and/or the Clubs to reduce the  
number of Major League Clubs is a mandatory subject of bargaining  
under the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”’). The Clubs, on the  
other hand, have consistently taken the position that such action is a  
permissive subject of bargaining under the NLRA. Without resolving  
this difference of opinion, the Parties have reached certain agreements  
on this topic during the negotiations over a successor Basic Agree-  
ment. Those agreements are reflected in Article XV(H) (Future Con-  
traction) of the new Basic Agreement. The Parties agree, by this letter,  
that their agreement on this topic and the bargaining that preceded it  
shall not be used by either party as evidence that the topic is or is not  
a mandatory subject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, includ-  
ing any grievance or NLRB proceeding.  
Very truly yours,  
Daniel R. Halem

Pursuant to Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and paragraph 10(a)  
of the Uniform Player’s Contract (““UPC’’), the Clubs hereby tender  
contracts to the following players for the term of the next year as  
follows:  
CLUB  
Player Name Salary For Major Performance Salary For Minor Other  
League Service Bonuses League Service  
[See Exhibit | hereto]  
Accordingly, the following players have not been tendered contracts  
for the term of the next year:  
CLUB  
Player Name  
[See Exhibit 2 hereto]  
Finally, Exhibit 3 provides the addresses of the Players who were pro-  
moted to a Major League roster for the first time this November and of  
those Players who, according to our records, do not have a certified  
Player Agent.  
Sincerely,

This will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding the last  
paragraph of Article XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and, specifically,  
the exercise of free agency rights by Players on the Restricted, Sus-  
pended, Disqualified, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military Lists:  
1. A Player who properly has been placed on the Restricted List,  
or who properly has been placed on the Disqualified List for fail-  
ure to render his services to his Club, shall be eligible to become a  
free agent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set  
forth therein. Upon becoming a free agent, such Player shall auto-  
matically be removed from the Restricted or Disqualified List and  
reinstated to active status. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Player  
who properly has been placed on the Restricted List for a violation  
of the Joint Drug Program or Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual  
Assault and Child Abuse Policy shall be eligible to become a free  
agent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set forth  
therein, but shall remain on the Restricted List until he completes  
his suspension.  
2. A Player who properly has been placed on the Disqualified  
List for a reason other than that stated in paragraph | above, or who  
properly has been placed on the Suspended, Ineligible, Voluntarily  
Retired or Military List, shall also be eligible to become a free agent  
as provided in Article XX, but he shall not be eligible to sign or play  
with a new Club until removed from such List and reinstated to  
active status.  
189  
ATTACHMENT 11  
This will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding Article  
XX(A) of the Basic Agreement and, specifically, the obligations of  
Clubs to tender Contracts to and renew Major League Contracts of  
Players on the Restricted, Suspended, Disqualified, Ineligible, Volun-  
tarily Retired or Military Lists:  
1. The Clubs’ obligations to tender and renew Contracts, as set  
forth in paragraph 10(a) of the Uniform Player’s Contract, shall  
apply with regard to any Player who, at the applicable time, is on a  
Restricted List, or is on a Disqualified List for failure to render his  
services to his Club. Should a Club fail to so tender or renew a Con-  
tract, the Player shall become a free agent without any restrictions  
or qualifications, and he automatically shall be removed from the  
Restricted or Disqualified List. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a  
Player who properly has been placed on the Restricted List for a  
violation of the Joint Drug Program or Joint Domestic Violence,  
Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy shall be eligible to become  
a free agent as provided in Article XX, if otherwise qualified as set  
forth therein, but shall remain on the Restricted List until he com-  
pletes his suspension.  
2. With regard to any Player who is on the Disqualified List for  
a reason other than that stated in paragraph | above, or is on the Sus-  
pended, Ineligible, Voluntarily Retired or Military List, the Club  
shall not be obligated to tender or renew a Contract until the Player  
is removed from such List and reinstated to active status. If a Player  
is removed from such List during a period beginning 10 days prior  
to the tender date set forth in Article XX(A) and extending through  
the next championship season, the Club shall tender a Contract to  
him within 10 days following such removal. Thereafter, should the  
Club and the Player fail to agree upon the terms of a new Contract  
within 10 days after the Player’s receipt of the tendered contract, the  
Club shall be obligated, within the next 5 days, to renew the Player’s  
prior Major League Contract; provided, however, that if the tender  
is made during the period beginning 10 days prior to the tender date  
set forth in Article XX(A) and ending on the next March 1, the  
renewal period shall be as set forth in paragraph 10(a) of the Uni-  
form Player’s Contract. Should a Club fail to tender or renew a Con-  
tract as provided in this paragraph, the Player shall become a free  
agent without any restrictions or qualifications.

ATTACHMENT 12  
This will set forth the understanding of the Parties regarding Article  
XX(A), of the Basic Agreement:  
With respect to a Minor League Player with no existing Major League  
Contract, whose Minor League contract has been assigned to a Major  
League Club, it is understood that the placing of such a Player on the  
Major League Club’s Active Reserve List (40-man Roster) and the ten-  
dering to such a Player of a Major League Contract without the neces-  
sity of renewing the Minor League contract will provide the Major  
League Club with reservation rights to such a Player. Thus, such a  
Player will not become a free agent under Article XX(A)(2)(d), which  
provides that a Player will become a free agent if his Club fails to exer-  
cise its contract renewal rights, there being no prior Major League  
Contract to renew.

Dear David:  
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the following understandings:  
I.  
Post-Season Reporting. During the period between the end of  
the championship season and the conclusion of a Club’s participa-  
tion in the post-season, players on the 40-man roster of that Club  
or players whose existing Major League contracts were assigned  
outright from a Major League roster may be directed by the Club  
to work out at the Club’s Spring Training facility, in the Club’s  
home city, on the road with the Club, or may voluntarily agree to  
work out at one or more of these locations with the consent of the  
Club, provided such players are potentially eligible to participate  
in the post-season under Major League Rule 40(a) and were not  
included on the relevant post-season roster. Such players shall  
receive first-class jet air and hotel accommodations in accordance  
with Article VII(A)(1), the applicable in-season meal and tip

Re: Home Run Derby  
Dear Rick:  
This letter confirms the Parties’ understandings regarding the Home  
Run Derby.  
1. Participants. There shall be eight (8) participants in the Home  
Run Derby. Participation shall be voluntary. The participants shall be  
selected by the Office of the Commissioner, in consultation with the  
Players Association based on the following criteria:  
A.current season home run leaders;  
B. prior success in the Home Run Derby;  
C. the location of the game;  
D. whether the player has been, or is likely to be, selected as an  
All-Star;  
E. the player’s home run totals in prior seasons;  
F. recent milestone achievements by the player;  
G. the player’s popularity;  
H. League representation; and  
I. the number of Clubs represented by the proposed players.  
The Office of the Commissioner shall provide a list to the Players Asso-  
ciation of the eight players that it desires to participate in the Home Run  
Derby. After making any adjustments to the list based on input received  
from the Players Association, the Office of the Commissioner shall  
request that the Players Association extend invitations to the eight play-  
ers on the list. If any of the eight players declines to participate in the  
Home Run Derby, or if one or more of the selected players cannot par-  
199  
ticipate due to injury, the Office of the Commissioner shall provide to  
the Players Association the names of additional players to be invited.  
The Players Association shall promptly report to the Office of the Com-  
missioner whether the players who have been invited have accepted the  
invitation. The Parties shall agree on a schedule by which all eight par-  
ticipants in the Home Run Derby shall be selected and announced.  
2. Single-Elimination Bracket Format. As illustrated below, the  
Home Run Derby shall be conducted in a single-elimination tourna-  
ment in which the loser of each bracket is immediately eliminated from  
winning. Brackets in the first round shall be seeded by the Office of the  
Commissioner, in consultation with the Players Association, taking  
into consideration the following factors: (1) the player's performance in  
the prior season's Home Run Derby; (11) the player's current season  
home run total; (111) whether the player is a member of the Club host-  
ing the All-Star Game; (iv) All-Star votes received in the current sea-  
son; and (v) any other appropriate factor as determined by the Parties.  
Whenever possible, teammates will be seeded to avoid hitting against  
each other in the first round of the tournament. The player with the  
higher seed in any given bracket shall have the option of hitting first or  
second in that round.  
RE  
   
Player 1/8  
Player 4/5  
   
Player 2/7  
Player 3/6  
   
3. Scoring/Advancement  
A. Home Runs. Home runs shall be counted toward a batter’s  
total score, and any swings or hits that result in anything other than a  
home run shall not be counted.  
200  
B. Advancement/Winning. The batter with the most home  
runs in each bracket shall eliminate his opponent and advance to the next  
round (or win the tournament, if in the third round).  
C. Tie-Breakers. Ties in any round shall be broken by a  
straight 60-second swing-off (with no stoppage of time or additional  
time added). If the batters remain tied after the 60-second swing-off,  
the batters shall engage in successive three-swing swing-offs until  
there is a winner.  
D. Second Batter Advancement. Once the second batter in  
any bracket hits one more home run than the first batter in that bracket,  
the second batter shall be declared the winner of that bracket and shall  
not attempt to hit any additional home runs.  
4. Timers  
A. 4:00 Regulation Period. Each batter shall have 4:00 min-  
utes to hit as many home runs as possible within that period. Timers  
will be placed in appropriate places on and off the field, with certain  
timers clearly visible to the batter.  
B. Release of Pitch. The timer will count down from 4:00  
minutes beginning with the release of the first pitch.  
C. Ending the Round. A round will end when the timer  
strikes zero. A home run shall count provided the pitch was released  
before the timer strikes zero.  
D. Successive Pitches. A pitcher cannot throw a pitch until a  
batted ball has hit the ground, was caught or left the field of play in  
foul territory. After a ball has been hit, the lead official will raise his  
right hand in the air to signify to the pitcher that he may throw the next  
pitch to the batter.  
E. Time Outs. Each batter in the first two rounds shall have  
the right to call one “time out” per round. Batters in the final round  
shall have the right to call two “time outs” in that round. A batter shall  
call a “time out” by raising his hand above his head or verbally  
requesting a time out from the official. The time out shall commence  
when the official signals the timer operator to stop the timer, and shall  
last 45 seconds (the second “time out” in the final round shall last 30  
seconds). The official shall direct the batter to enter the batter’s box at  
the end of the time out, and the timer shall commence when the pitcher  
releases the next pitch.  
201  
F. Bonus Period. In a given round, a batter will be awarded  
thirty seconds of bonus time if he hits at least two home runs that each  
equal or exceed 440 feet in that round. All distances will be measured  
using MLBAM’s Statcast system. If Statcast 1s unable to record the  
distance of a home run, a batter only will be given credit for the home  
run for purposes of this bonus provision if there is no doubt that the  
home run landed at least 440 feet from home plate based on alternative  
methods of estimating the distance. Following the Regulation Period,  
there shall be a break of up to one minute (depending on the preference  
of the batter) before the commencement of the Bonus Period. The  
timer will count down commencing with the release of the first pitch  
in the Bonus Period.  
5. Pitchers & Officiating  
A. Pitchers. Each participant shall have the right to select his  
own pitcher.  
B. Official Scorer. The Office of the Commissioner will  
select an individual to serve as the Official Scorer of the event. The  
Official Scorer will make the final determination regarding any issue  
with respect to scoring, home run distance, timers, and any other issue  
that arises during the event.  
C. Lead Official. The Office of the Commissioner will select  
one individual to serve as the lead official on the field. The Lead Offi-  
cial will notify the pitcher when he may pitch to the batter, and enforce  
the appropriate time periods. The Lead Official will communicate with  
the Official Scorer and timer operators by headset.  
6. Prizes. On or before July 31 following each Home Run Derby  
the Office of the Commissioner shall provide $525,000 in bonuses  
(less any applicable taxes or withholdings) to the participants in the  
following amounts:  
2017 & 2018 2019-2021

202  
7. Bats. Players may use bats in colors or with designs not other-  
wise permitted under Major League Baseball’s Bat Regulations, pro-  
vided that:  
A. the bat meets all other requirements of a bat approved for use  
in Professional Play (e.g., its dimensions and density are compliant  
with the Bat Regulations);  
B. the bat does not contain any markings that are designed for a  
commercial purpose, including the promotion of a product or com-  
pany, other than the name and/or logo of the bat manufacturer in a size  
that complies with the Bat Regulations;  
C. the bat does not contain any messages or images that may  
offend fans, players or others associated with the event; and  
D. participants will bring a sample bat to the meeting that pre-  
cedes the event. A representative of the Commissioner’s Office respon-  
sible for bat compliance will attend the meeting together with a  
representative from the Players Association and check the bats. If any  
bat 1s deemed by such representatives to be not in compliance, that par-  
ticipant will use his All-Star Game bat.  
Bats approved for use during the Home Run Derby under this  
provision may not be used during the All-Star Game or any other  
Major League or Minor League games (exhibition or otherwise).  
8. Microphones. All participants in the Home Run Derby, and  
players watching the event on the sidelines, will be encouraged by the  
Players Association to wear a microphone pursuant to the standards  
described in Article XV(N)(8) (‘Miking’’). In no event shall less than  
four (4) participants wear a microphone for the event; provided that  
staff from the Players Association shall be exclusively responsible for  
communications with Players in this regard.  
9. Commercial Sponsorship Activities. At least the earlier of (a)  
promptly following the date such sponsorships are secured or (b) seven  
days prior to the Home Run Derby, the Parties will discuss any oppor-  
tunities for participants in the event to engage in sponsorship, endorse-  
ment or promotional activities in connection with any commercial  
sponsors of the Home Run Derby. To that end, MLB shall send the  
Players Association on or before that date, a list of all approved or  
planned sponsors and proposed promotional activities. If a sponsor  
wants any player or players to wear or use such sponsor’s product, serv-  
ice or logo, the Players Association must review and approve same.  
203  
10. Promotional Activities. The participants in the Home Run  
Derby, upon request, will engage in two non-sponsored promotional  
activities for MLB or ESPN solely designed to promote the event. Any  
requested promotional activities beyond the two commitments refer-  
enced above shall be completely voluntary for each participant. All  
promotional activities shall take place at such times and places as will  
be convenient for the involved participant. The Office of the Commis-  
sioner will provide the Players Association with written notice at least  
three days prior to the event of any such promotional activities  
requested under this paragraph. Failure to comply with the notice  
requirements hereunder shall result in the related obligations transi-  
tioning to become entirely voluntary.  
11. Charitable Contributions. The Office of the Commissioner  
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to agree with a sponsor to  
provide a charitable contribution to the participants of the Home Run  
Derby.  
12. Notice of and Agreement to Modification. In the event that the  
Office of the Commissioner desires to modify this format in a manner  
that impacts terms and conditions of players’ employment, it will propose  
such method to the Association prior to May | of any year, and reach  
agreement with the Association on the method before it is implemented.

July 31 of the year preceding the championship season in which  
the jersey number change would take effect. Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, the Office of the Commissioner will not deny a  
request to change a Player’s jersey number even when the requi-  
site notice was not provided if: (a) the Player changed Clubs fol-  
lowing the notification deadline; or (b) the Player (or someone on  
his behalf) purchases the existing finished goods inventory of  
apparel containing the Player’s jersey number that is held on

batting gloves, wristbands, elbow protectors, shin/ankle protec-  
tors and catcher’s equipment; and (b) a nickname on fielding

J.  
must cover his tattoos or markings will be final and binding  
on the Player, the Players Association, Major League Clubs  
and umpires.  
Permissible Alterations  
1. Pant length alterations consistent with past practice and Sec-  
tion B, above.  
2. Sleeve length alterations consistent with past practice and  
Section C, above.  
3. Tapering of pants and jerseys.  
Wristbands  
No Player is permitted to wear white wristbands or bandages, because  
of the possible difficulty in distinguishing the baseball from the wrist-  
band or bandage. This prohibition extends to white wristbands with a  
stripe insufficient to permit the distinction.  
K.  
Gloves  
1. Any pitcher starting or entering a game wearing a colored  
glove must wear a glove of the same color for the pitcher’s entire  
participation in the game.  
2. The pitcher’s glove may not, exclusive of piping, be white,  
gray, nor, in the judgment of an umpire, distracting in any man-  
ner. See Official Baseball Rule 3.07(a).  
3. Any Player wearing a golf or batting glove underneath a play-  
ing glove may not rub up balls for use by the pitcher.  
Helmets  
1. Each catcher shall wear a catcher’s protective helmet while  
fielding the position. Provided that such protective helmet has  
been approved by the Official Playing Rules Committee, a  
catcher may wear any protective helmet that conforms with past  
practice. See Official Baseball Rule 3.09.  
215  
2. All batting helmets must have the Major League Baseball sil-  
houetted batter logo on the back of the helmet and may not  
include any corporate logos. The Club and Major League Base-  
ball silhouetted batter logos cannot be obscured.  
Other  
1. A catcher entering the on-deck circle as the next batter shall  
have removed his shin guards before entering the on-deck circle.  
2. Catchers’ shin guards and chest protectors may not contain  
any white (other than the corporate logo).  
3. A Player will not be permitted to display corporate logos or  
other identifying marks on equipment, apparel or outerwear other  
than on: (a) the items set forth in the Uniform Regulations’  
Logo/ID Specifications; (b) items issued by his Club; or (c) items  
that at least ten players have regularly used or worn in a game  
prior to the conclusion of the 2011 championship season. With  
respect to any category of equipment or apparel not covered by  
the Uniform Regulations, the Players Association and Major  
League Baseball will explore in good faith the possibility of  
jointly selling an exclusive or non-exclusive license for that cat-  
egory of equipment or apparel. If the sale of such a joint license  
is not feasible and Major League Baseball objects to the display  
of a logo or marks on a particular product, the Player cannot dis-  
play the logo or marks until the Parties resolve the issue or, if  
Major League Baseball files a grievance under Article XI(B) of  
the Basic Agreement, the completion of an expedited grievance  
process. In a grievance arbitration over this issue, both Parties  
reserve all of their arguments under the Basic Agreement, the  
Major League Rules, the Official Baseball Rules, and the Uni-  
form Player’s Contract to support their respective positions.  
Nothing in this paragraph is intended to prohibit a Player from  
using equipment permitted under the Official Baseball Rules if  
the corporate logos or marks are concealed.  
4. MLB-Designated Theme Days. Players are prohibited from  
wearing items and using equipment consistent with a Major  
League Baseball-designated theme for a specific game day (e.g.,  
Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day,  
etc.) except for such specific items or equipment that have been  
216  
N.  
approved and communicated with reasonable advance notice to  
the Players Association and the Clubs’ equipment managers. Vio-  
lations of this policy will be deemed to be flagrant under Para-  
graph 4 of Section O, below.  
To the extent that a Player desires to wear an item or use equip-  
ment that is not authorized for use on an MLB-Designated theme  
day, the Player must obtain advance approval from the Commis-  
sioner’s Office, which approval shall not be unreasonably with-  
held, provided that: (a) the color and design of the item or  
equipment is consistent with that of the particular theme day; (b)  
no corporate logos or distinguishing marks are displayed on the  
item or equipment; and (c) the category of item or equipment has  
been approved for use in Major League games on non-theme  
days. It is encouraged that the manufacturer of the item or equip-  
ment contributes funds to the designated charity of the theme day.  
In addition, the Office of the Commissioner shall: make available  
to Players, if practical, non-logoed items or equipment if the  
Player wants to participate in the theme day event but does not  
desire to use a product manufactured by the designated corporate  
sponsor; and, provide the Players Association with recognition  
supporting theme day. A player who declines to participate, in  
whole or in part, in any MLB-designated theme day shall be per-  
mitted to wear any item or use any equipment he would otherwise  
use/wear during a non-theme day.  
Enforcement  
The Chief Baseball Officer shall enforce these Regulations and impose  
discipline as set forth in Section O below. In addition, umpires shall  
have the authority to enforce on the field those Regulations that cover  
the traditional domain of umpires. (See, e.g., Official Playing Rule  
3.08 (Comment). )  
O. Discipline  
1. Players will be subject to the following discipline schedule  
for violations of these Uniform Regulations:  
(a) First violation: the Chief Baseball Officer will issue a Uni-  
form Regulations Violation Warning, setting forth the provi-  
217  
(b)  
(Cc)  
(d)  
sion of the Uniform Regulations that the Player has violated  
and specifying that the Player will be subject to further disci-  
pline if he does not immediately cease violating the Regula-  
tions;  
Second violation within the same Section of the Uniform  
Regulations or regarding the same “Product” on the Uniform  
and Equipment Logo/ID Specifications: the Chief Baseball  
Officer will issue a Notice of Discipline, which levies a  
$1,000 fine and sets forth the provision of the Uniform Reg-  
ulations that the Player has violated for the second time and  
specifies that the Player will be subject to additional disci-  
pline if he does not immediately cease violating the Regula-  
tions;  
Third violation within the same Section of the Uniform Reg-  
ulations or regarding the same “Product” on the Uniform and  
Equipment Logo/ID Specifications: the Chief Baseball Offi-  
cer will issue a Notice of Discipline, which levies a $5,000  
fine and sets forth the provision of the Uniform Regulations  
that the Player has violated for the third time and specifies  
that the Player will be subject to additional discipline if he  
does not immediately cease violating the Regulations;  
Fourth violation within the same Section of the Uniform  
Regulations or regarding the same “Product” on the Uniform  
and Equipment Logo/ID Specifications: the Chief Baseball  
Officer will issue a Notice of Discipline, which levies a  
$10,000 fine and sets forth the provision of the Uniform Reg-  
ulations that the Player has violated for the fourth time and  
directs that the Player will not be permitted to play in  
championship season games (including Spring Training and  
post-season games, if applicable) until the Player’s uniform  
is in compliance with the Regulations and the Official Play-  
ing Rules.  
2. The fine schedule set forth in Paragraph 1 above shall apply  
no matter how much time has elapsed between violations.  
3. Complaints involving discipline imposed upon a Player by  
the Chief Baseball Officer for a violation of the Uniform Regula-  
tions shall be subject exclusively to Article XI(C) of the Basic  
218  
Agreement. If the Chief Baseball Officer imposes discipline con-  
sistent with Paragraph | above, the only issue before the Special  
Assistant to the Commissioner shall be whether the Player com-  
mitted the violation alleged in the Notice of Discipline. If the  
Special Assistant to the Commissioner finds that the Player com-  
mitted the violation alleged in the Notice of Discipline, the disci-  
pline shall be as set forth in the Notice of Discipline. In cases  
involving discipline imposed under Paragraph 1.c above, the  
Special Assistant to the Commissioner shall attempt to hear the  
appeal within two weeks of the date on which it was filed. If the  
appeal cannot be heard during that period due to the Player’s  
unwillingness to participate in the city in which his Club is  
scheduled to play or the Players Association’s inability to travel  
to such city, the appeal shall be heard by teleconference. If the  
appeal cannot be heard during that period for any other reason,  
the appeal shall be heard, in the city in which the Player’s Club  
is scheduled to play, at the earliest available date. In cases involv-  
ing discipline imposed under Paragraph 1.d above, the appeal  
shall be heard as soon as practicable in a location that does not  
make the Player unavailable to play or the city where the Player’s  
Club is scheduled to play, but not later than 4 business days from  
the imposition of the directive.  
4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will apply to a  
violation of Section M.3 after a warning and to repeated or a sin-  
gle flagrant or provocative breach of the Uniform Regulations  
involving an intentional impermissible alteration, writing or  
illustration or other marking made by a Player to any part of his  
uniform (including the cap and the helmet, batter or catcher):  
(a) The Chief Baseball Officer may impose fines at levels differ-  
ent from the levels reflected in Paragraph 1 above. Com-  
plaints involving a fine imposed upon a Player by the Chief  
Baseball Officer that is greater than the amount set forth in  
Paragraph | for such violation shall be subject exclusively to  
Article XI(C) of the Basic Agreement but the Player may  
challenge the level of discipline imposed in addition to the  
fact that discipline was imposed.  
(b) The Chief Baseball Officer may direct, prior to the fourth  
such violation, that the Player will not be permitted to play in  
219  
(c)  
championship season games (including Spring Training and  
post-season games, if applicable) until the Player’s uniform is  
in compliance with the Regulations and the Official Playing  
Rules. Complaints involving such a directive shall be subject  
exclusively to Article XI(C) of the Basic Agreement but the  
Player may challenge the level of discipline imposed in addi-  
tion to the fact that discipline was imposed. The implementa-  
tion of such a directive shall not be stayed by a Player’s  
appeal. A Player’s appeal of such a directive shall be heard as  
soon as practicable in a location that does not make the Player  
unavailable to play or in the city where the Player’s Club is  
scheduled to play, but not later than 4 business days from the  
imposition of the directive. A Player precluded from play  
because of failure to comply with such a directive shall not be  
paid for any game missed as a result of such discipline; pro-  
vided, however, that such Player shall be made whole pur-  
suant to Article XII(A) of the Basic Agreement if his appeal  
of such discipline is upheld in full or in part.  
The Chief Baseball Officer may not impose any other disci-  
pline, including a suspension, upon a Player for any such vio-  
lation.  
5. Fines issued by the Chief Baseball Officer for any violations  
of the Uniform Regulations shall be payable within two weeks  
from the date of the Notice of Discipline. All fine payments  
(made payable to Major League Baseball) must be sent to the  
Department of On-Field Operations at Major League Baseball.

Measurement. Whether a proposed corporate or manufacturer’s  
logo/ID is within the permissible size described above shall be deter-  
mined by the industry practice known as the “leading edge trailing  
edge standard.” This standard is as follows:  
1. The “dimension” regulations referenced in the above chart  
would be applied by measuring from the leading edge of the logo to  
the trailing edge of the logo and from the very top of the logo to the  
very bottom of the logo.  
2. Once the dimension regulation is satisfied, the number of  
square inches of the logo would be calculated using the geometric  
formula for the closest approximate, standard geometric shape (i.e.,  
rectangle, square, circle).

Dear Dan:  
The Clubs, throughout this and previous rounds of negotiations, have  
consistently maintained that the Commissioner’s regulation of industry  
debt is not a mandatory subject of bargaining under the National Labor  
Relations Act. We, on the other hand, have consistently taken the posi-  
tion that it is.  
In furtherance of the negotiations on an overall Basic Agreement, you  
proposed changes to the debt regulations known as the Debt Service  
Rule, contingent upon a prior acknowledgment by the Association that  
the proposal and any discussion that it may generate, including any  
subsequent counterproposals, are without prejudice to the Clubs’ legal  
position on bargainability.  
The Association, by this letter, provides that acknowledgment. It  
agrees that the proposal and discussions shall not be used as evidence  
by the Association that the topic of debt regulation is a mandatory sub-  
ject of bargaining in any subsequent litigation, including any grievance  
or NLRB proceeding.  
This acknowledgment and agreement is, of course, without prejudice  
to the Association’s position that the topic is a mandatory one.  
Sincerely,  
Tony C. Clark

Re: Debt Regulation  
Dear Tony:  
This letter will memorialize our additional understandings on debt reg-  
ulation, and shall be considered an agreement between the Association  
and the Clubs within the meaning of Article XI(A)(1)(a) of the Basic  
Agreement.  
First, the Parties agree that the Panel cannot resolve disputes concern-  
ing the meaning, interpretation or application of the Debt Service Rule  
without resort to its bargaining history, in this or earlier bargaining  
rounds, which reflects understandings that significantly inform the  
meaning of the Rule as intended by the Parties.  
Second, our negotiations over and agreement to the Debt Service Rule  
are both subject to the agreement reflected in Attachment 20. More-  
over, the Parties reserve their legal positions regarding the bargaining  
status of any action taken by the Commissioner pursuant to Section 6.1  
of the Debt Service Rule.  
Third, it was the Parties’ intention, in agreeing to the Debt Service  
Rule, to ensure that each individual Club has or would have sufficient  
resources to support its level of debt or proposed debt, as opposed to  
an intention to limit or reduce the amount that the Clubs or a particu-  
lar Club could spend on Player salaries.  
Fourth, the Parties do not intend for the Debt Service Rule to displace  
or otherwise limit the authority of the Commissioner to take actions,  
consistent with actions taken in the past, that are designed to preserve  
the financial stability of the Clubs. As he has done in the past, the  
Commissioner will consult with the Players Association prior to taking  
any such action against a Club that may affect the interests of Players.  
224  
Fifth, during the term of this Agreement, and subject to Paragraph 6.1  
of the Debt Service Rule, the Commissioner shall adopt no other form  
of debt regulation.  
Sincerely,  
Daniel R. Halem  
Chief Legal Officer

ATTACHMENT 22  
Section 1.  
Section 2.  
DEBT SERVICE RULE  
The Rule. No Club may maintain more Total Club Debt  
than can reasonably be supported by its EBITDA. A  
Club’s Total Club Debt cannot reasonably be supported by  
its EBITDA if Total Club Debt exceeds the product of that  
Club’s EBITDA during the most recent year multiplied by  
the EBITDA Multiplier applicable to that Club.  
Definitions. Subject to the amendment procedures set out  
in Section 6.1 below, the following definitions shall be uti-  
lized in the administration of the Debt Service Rule:  
(a) EBITDA. “EBITDA” means a Club’s earnings for  
its fiscal year, before interest, taxes, depreciation and  
amortization, as calculated and reported in accordance  
with Part I, Schedule I, Section D, Line 45 of the annual  
Financial Information Questionnaire (“FIQ”’), which each  
Club must submit to the Office of the Commissioner after  
the close of each fiscal year. For the purposes of this Debt  
Service Rule, each Club shall calculate its annual  
EBITDA net of the Club’s net receipts or net payments  
under any revenue sharing arrangements then in effect  
among the Major League Clubs.  
(b) Total Club Debt. “Total Club Debt” means a  
Club’s total outstanding debt, calculated as an average  
over the course of each fiscal year, including, without lim-  
itation, all long-term and short-term obligations and all  
indebtedness resulting from: (1) debt incurred pursuant to  
the Major League Baseball industry credit facility; (2)  
Club Supported Debt incurred by the Club or any Club  
related party; provided that with respect to any third-party  
indebtedness incurred by a Club related party, such indebt-  
edness shall be deemed to be Club Supported Debt unless  
the Club delivers all relevant Club related party financial  
statements and annual budgets to the Office of the Com-  
missioner and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the  
Office of the Commissioner, that such indebtedness is  
226  
serviceable or payable, in whole, by non-Club funds  
(regardless of whether such indebtedness is collateralized  
by assets of the Club); (3) deferred compensation (other  
than deferred compensation payable to Major League  
Players (see clause (9) below)); (4) stadium-related debt  
incurred for or in connection with ballpark construction or  
improvements; provided, however, that any debt falling  
within this clause (4) shall not become part of Total Club  
Debt until the first full season of the operation of the new  
or renovated stadium for which such debt was incurred;  
and (5) any other debt that is properly classified as indebt-  
edness of the Club under generally accepted accounting  
principles in place as of the effective date of this Basic  
Agreement, but excluding: (6) the Excludable Debt; (7)  
advances taken by a Club against future revenue that it is  
contractually entitled to receive; (8) any debt issued in  
connection with the monetization of a long-term Club  
business contract, the proceeds of which are placed into an  
escrow account controlled by the Office of the Commis-  
sioner; and (9) any compensation payable to Major League  
Players, including deferred compensation or any other  
commitment under a Uniform Player’s Contract, or any  
obligation to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit  
Plan or Industry Growth Fund. “Excludable Debt” shall be  
the first seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) in out-  
standing debt from any of the sources described in clauses  
(1)-(5) above. “Club Supported Debt” means any indebt-  
edness (including any loan, advance or guarantee) that is  
collateralized by the assets of the Club (including any  
pledge of a direct or indirect interest in the Club) or serv-  
iced or payable, in whole or in part, either directly or indi-  
rectly, using Club funds; provided that, with respect to any  
loans or advances from a Club’s owner or any related  
party that are neither collateralized by the assets of the  
Club (including any pledge of a direct or indirect interest  
in the Club) nor serviced, in whole or in part, either  
directly or indirectly, using Club funds, such indebtedness  
shall be deemed to be Club Supported Debt if the Club has  
not delivered all relevant related party financial statements  
and annual budgets to the Office of the Commissioner.  
227  
(c) EBITDA Multiplier. “EBITDA Multiplier” means  
the number to be multiplied by the Club’s EBITDA during  
the most recent year in order to determine the maximum  
Total Club Debt that reasonably can be supported by that  
Club’s EBITDA. The EBITDA Multiplier shall be eight  
(8), except that any Club which incurs (or has incurred  
within the last ten years) stadium-related debt to finance  
construction of a new ballpark or the major renovation of  
its existing ballpark may use an EBITDA Multiplier of  
twelve (12) for the first ten (10) fiscal years after that ball-  
park’s opening or reopening.  
(d) Accounting Rules. Each Club’s reporting and  
accounting practices relevant to an evaluation of its compli-  
ance with the Debt Service Rule shall be subject to the  
Commissioner’s review and approval. Moreover, in any  
case involving off-balance-sheet debt, the determination of  
whether the indebtedness shall be included in Total Club  
Debt under Section 2(b) above shall be made by an auditor  
retained by the Office of the Commissioner, applying gen-  
erally accepted accounting principles on a consolidated  
basis except as otherwise provided by Section 2(b) above.  
The Major League Baseball Players Association (“Players  
Association”) may seek review of the auditor’s determina-  
tion by the Arbitration Panel (see Article XI), in which case  
the Panel shall show no deference to the auditor’s determi-  
nation. Unless otherwise provided in this Rule, when  
accounting for and reporting on Total Club Debt and  
EBITDA for purposes of the Debt Service Rule, the Clubs  
shall comply with the revenue and expense definitions and  
the accounting conventions, policies and practices reflected  
in the then-current version of the FIQ. The Commissioner  
reserves the right to modify the FIQ reporting requirements  
as they relate to the Debt Service Rule. The Players Associ-  
ation may seek review of all accounting rulings made by the  
Commissioner (or any Committee or outside accounting or  
other expert assisting him), in connection with the Rule by  
the Arbitration Panel in which case the Panel shall show no  
deference to the Commissioner’s rulings.  
228  
Section 3. Annual Compliance Certification; Commissioner  
Enforcement.  
3.1 Annual Compliance Certifications. By the date each  
Club must provide its final FIQ and audited financial  
statements for each fiscal year, each Club shall also sub-  
mit to the Office of the Commissioner:  
(a) a written certification from its chief executive offi-  
cer that either the Club complied with the Debt Service  
Rule during the fiscal year reported in the accompanying  
FIQ, or the Club did not comply with the Debt Service  
Rule during the fiscal year reported in the accompanying  
FIQ; and  
(b) a written summary (‘“Related-Party Debt Sum-  
mary”) from its chief executive officer of all owner or  
related-party debt that was collateralized by Club assets or  
was serviced, either directly or indirectly, using Club funds  
or assets.  
3.2 Enforcement by Commissioner. The failure of a Club  
to comply with the Debt Service Rule in a fiscal year shall  
subject the Club and/or any owner of the Club to any or all  
of the remedial measures (“Remedial Measures”’) set out  
in Section 4 below until the Club achieves compliance  
with the Debt Service Rule.  
3.3 Exemption from Compliance. Clubs with Total Club  
Debt below the level of Excludable Debt are exempt from  
the compliance process (but still must adhere to the certi-  
fication requirement of Section 3.1 above and the financial  
reporting obligations established by the Office of the  
Commissioner, the latter of which are described in Attach-  
ment 23).  
Section 4. Remedial Measures for Non-Compliance.  
4.1 The Commissioner may, after consultation with the  
Players Association pursuant to Section 6.4(d) below and  
consistent with Section 5 and Section 6.5 below, impose  
any or all of the Remedial Measures contained in Section  
4.2 on any Club and/or any owner of a Club for a Club’s  
failure to comply with the Debt Service Rule. Notwith-  
229  
standing the foregoing, the Commissioner shall not  
impose Remedial Measures on a Club and/or owner of a  
Club for a Club’s failure to comply with the Debt Service  
Rule if the Club complied with the Debt Service Rule in  
the immediately preceding year and the Club demonstrates  
that it realistically projects compliance in the year follow-  
ing its first year of non-compliance.  
4.2 The Remedial Measures are:  
(a) Require the Club to submit, for the Commissioner’s  
review and approval, a written plan for achieving compli-  
ance with the Debt Service Rule (the “Compliance  
Each Compliance Plan shall identify the fiscal year during  
which the Club proposes to achieve compliance and the  
specific steps the Club intends to take to bring the Club  
into compliance with the Debt Service Rule;  
(b) Require the Club to consult with the Commissioner  
prior to entering into any contract with a term of more than  
five (5) years (except that this Section 4(b) shall not apply  
to any Uniform Player’s Contract with a Major League  
Player);  
(c) Prohibit the Club from incurring any additional  
Club Debt (as defined in this Rule) without the approval  
of the Commissioner;  
(d) Require the Club to reduce some or all of its out-  
standing debt by raising additional equity on whatever  
terms the Commissioner deems appropriate;  
(ec) Prohibit the Club from making any capital expendi-  
tures without the approval of the Commissioner;  
(f) Require the Club to perform or refrain from any  
other action that the Commissioner deems necessary in  
order to ensure that the Club brings its Total Club Debt  
into compliance with the Debt Service Rule;  
(g) Retention by the Commissioner of all or any por-  
tion of the Club’s share of: (1) the Central Fund, and/or (11)  
gate receipts from the Wild Card Game, Division Series,  
League Championship Series and World Series, so that  
230  
such retained funds may be held in escrow and used as  
directed by the Commissioner to reduce the Club’s out-  
standing debt, subject to the Club’s existing obligations to  
players and subject to contractual obligations to third par-  
ties made by the Club in good faith before the Club had  
notice of the proposed adoption of the Debt Service Rule;  
(h) Reservation by the Commissioner of the power to  
approve a Club’s general and administrative expenditures,  
including, without limitation, the power to approve and/or  
limit individual line items in a Club’s annual budget;  
(1) Limit, or suspend, the Club’s ability to obtain addi-  
tional financing under the Major League Baseball industry  
credit facility and/or any other line of credit or financing  
arrangement obtained on behalf of that Club or on behalf  
of all Clubs by the Office of the Commissioner;  
(j) Suspend the benefit of the Major League Rules,  
such as selection rights available to the Club under Major  
League Rule 5, except that any suspension of the Club’s  
rights under Major League Rule 4 shall not affect the  
assignment of the selection rights that the Club would lose  
or gain in connection with a player signing as provided in  
any collectively bargained agreement then in effect  
between the Clubs and the Players Association;  
(k) Deny the Club’s right to be represented at Major  
League meetings and/or deny representation on Major  
League Committees;  
(1) Suspend individual executive or ownership person-  
nel of the Club;  
(m) Impose monetary sanctions against individual  
executive or ownership personnel of the Club;  
(n) Any other measures or sanctions which the Com-  
missioner has the power to impose on a Club or Club  
owner pursuant to the Major League Constitution;  
(o) Any sanction which the Major League Clubs may  
impose upon another Club or Club owner under the Major  
League Constitution, if the imposition of such a sanction  
231  
Section 5.  
Section 6.  
is duly authorized by the vote of the Major League Clubs  
in the manner required by the Major League Constitution;  
and/or  
(p) Require ownership to guarantee the Club’s debt  
service for the next three years, without recourse to the  
Club. Subject to liquidity concerns that the Commissioner  
may have, mandatory debt reduction (see subparagraphs (c)  
and (d) above) shall be the preferred Remedial Measure.  
Remedial Considerations. In developing a set of Reme-  
dial Measures for a Club under Section 4 above, the Com-  
missioner shall consider the following factors:  
(a) As an initial matter, the Commissioner must assess  
the Club’s general creditworthiness as reflected in the  
availability of credit to the Club in commercial markets  
(through measures such as but not limited to the terms on  
which it holds debt and the willingness of the Club’s indi-  
vidual lenders to attest to their confidence that the Club  
will be able to satisfy its obligations as they become due)  
and in the asset value of the Club in relation to the absolute  
level of the Club’s debt;  
(b) The Club’s record of compliance with the Rule  
over the preceding three years;  
(c) The Club’s projection of compliance or non-com-  
pliance over the three-year planning period in conjunction  
with the Club’s past history of accurately projecting com-  
pliance or non-compliance;  
(d) The occurrence of factors affecting the industry  
which have affected the ability of all Clubs to comply with  
the Debt Service Rule such that there has been a signifi-  
cant increase in the number of non-compliant Clubs; and  
(e) The capacity and willingness of the owner or own-  
ers to guarantee debt service for the next three years, with-  
out recourse to the Club.  
Miscellaneous  
6.1 Further Regulations; Amendments. The Commis-  
sioner shall issue further regulations and policies concern-  
Zod  
ing the implementation, interpretation, administration and  
enforcement of this Debt Service Rule as he deems appro-  
priate. In addition, the Commissioner may amend or oth-  
erwise modify the rules, definitions and policies set out in  
this Debt Service Rule as he deems appropriate. Prior to  
taking any action pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Office  
of the Commissioner shall provide the Players Association  
with notice of such contemplated action pursuant to Arti-  
cle XVIII of the Basic Agreement.  
6.2 Notice to Third Parties. All Clubs shall give appro-  
priate written notice to affected third parties of the require-  
ments of the Debt Service Rule before entering into any  
contract with such parties that reasonably might be  
affected, as to either execution or performance, by the  
Commissioner’s exercise of his powers under this Debt  
Service Rule.  
6.3 Prohibited Remedial Measures. The Commissioner  
shall not, in exercising his authority under Section 4  
above, attempt to influence or interfere with any Club  
decision regarding a Major League Player’s contract,  
reserve status or roster status. Moreover, the Commis-  
sioner shall take no action directed at preventing a Club  
from establishing its Major League Player payroll budget  
at a level that the Club deems appropriate.  
6.4 Players Association’s Right To Information. The  
Office of the Commissioner shall provide the Players  
Association with the following information:  
(a) EBITDA, Total Club Debt and total allowable debt  
(EBITDA multiplied by the applicable EBITDA Multi-  
plier) calculations for each Club, at the time the Office of  
the Commissioner provides FIQs to the Players Associa-  
tion pursuant to Article XXIV(D)(2) of the Basic Agree-  
ment and at any time as such calculations may be provided  
to the Commissioner on an interim or forecast basis prior  
to the Clubs’ FIQ submissions;  
(b) Related-Party Debt Summaries and Compliance  
Plans submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to this  
233  
Rule, within seven days of receipt by the Office of the  
Commissioner;  
(c) Correspondence from the Office of the Commis-  
sioner or a Club in connection with the operation of Sec-  
tion 4 above, within seven days of the Office of the  
Commissioner’s transmittal or receipt of such correspon-  
dence; and  
(d) Drafts of proposed correspondence to Clubs impos-  
ing Remedial Measures pursuant to Section 4 above.  
Within ten (10) days of providing such drafts, the Office  
of the Commissioner shall meet with the Players Associa-  
tion to discuss the Remedial Measures contemplated by  
the Commissioner.  
Any documents and/or other information provided to  
the Players Association pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall  
be covered by the Parties’ Confidentiality Agreement (see  
Attachment 14).  
The Office of the Commissioner must notify the Play-  
ers Association of any changes in the central debt agree-  
ments.  
6.5 Sale Transactions. In all transactions involving the  
sale or transfer of a control interest in a Club, and prior to  
the approval of any such transaction, the prospective new  
Club ownership must provide the Commissioner with a  
Long Term Plan for Debt Service compliance (Long Term  
Plan). The Long Term Plan shall be supported by specific  
financial information and shall cover no fewer than two  
years but no more than five years. The Commissioner will  
issue written comments on the Long Term Plan prior to the  
transaction’s approval. In connection with all such transac-  
tions, the Commissioner must certify to the Clubs and to  
the Players Association that the level of debt undertaken in  
connection with the acquisition or transfer will not create a  
persistent inability of the Club to comply with the require-  
ments of the Debt Service Rule. As part of that certifica-  
tion, the Commissioner, within 30 days of approval of the  
transaction, will provide to the Players Association the new  
234  
Club ownership’s Long Term Plan and the Commissioner’s  
written comments on the Long Term Plan. Absent material  
deviations from the Long Term Plan, a Club will be exempt  
from Section 4 remediation for the duration of the Long  
Term Plan.  
6.6 Reopener; Right To Strike. In the event of an increase  
in the maximum debt available to an individual Club  
under the industry credit facility of greater than 30%,  
measured off an amortized basis, the Players Association  
may reopen this Agreement, upon the giving of 10 days’  
written notice, with reference solely to the level of Exclud-  
able Debt. If negotiations in good faith following such  
reopener do not produce an agreement, the Players Asso-  
ciation will have the right to strike over the topic of the  
level of Excludable Debt. This grant of the right to strike  
is without prejudice to the Parties’ respective positions as  
to whether the Rule is a mandatory topic of bargaining and  
to any other assertions the Clubs may have that such a  
strike would otherwise be illegal.

Re: Multi-Purpose Financial Reporting Process  
Dear Tony:  
The Clubs are required to submit financial information to the Office of  
the Commissioner for multiple purposes, including the administration  
of the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Debt Service Rule and for gen-  
eral business monitoring. The current reporting schedule is as follows:  
1. Year End Financial Information Questionnaires and  
Audited Financial Statements are due 90 days after the con-  
clusion of the Club’s fiscal year.  
2. Long Range Plans are due on April 25 and December 10.  
3. Financial Information Questionnaires, including  
calculations of NDLR, are due on April 25, July 15, Sep-  
tember 15 and October 25.  
The Office of the Commissioner will provide advance notice to the  
Players Association in the event any changes are made to the reporting  
schedule outlined herein.

Dear Tony:  
Absent a prior unconditional release, a Club that has agreed to Major  
League terms in a Minor League Uniform Player Contract (“Minor  
League UPC’) may not sign a player to a Major League Uniform  
Player’s Contract (“Major League UPC”) with terms that are less  
favorable to the player than those Major League terms for that season  
included in the Minor League UPC. Notwithstanding the definitions of  
“Player” and “Grievance” in Article XI, a player (and the Association)  
may enforce this right in the Grievance Procedure. Our agreement to  
allow such matters to be heard in the Grievance Procedure does not,  
however, reflect an agreement that Minor League UPCs may be  
enforced in the Grievance Procedure or are a mandatory topic of bar-

agrees that this letter shall not be used as evidence in any effort to sup-

Dear Tony:  
The purpose of this letter is to confirm that the Parties have agreed to  
establish a Joint Treatment Program to deal with certain alcohol-  
related conduct and off-field violent conduct by Major League Players  
during the term of the Basic Agreement. Specifically, the  
Parties have agreed as follows:  
1.  
The Treatment Board, as defined under Major League Baseball’s  
Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, will be responsi-  
ble for creating and supervising individualized treatment pro-  
grams for Players with an alcohol use problem or Players who  
have engaged in off-field violent conduct. Notwithstanding the  
foregoing, if such conduct constitutes a “Covered Act” under the  
Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy  
(see Attachment 52), Player evaluation and treatment shall be pur-  
suant to the terms of that Policy.  
Referral to the Treatment Board will be mandatory when:  
(a) A Player is arrested or charged by law enforcement authori-  
ties with driving while intoxicated, driving under the influ-  
ence of alcohol, or any other criminal violation relating to the  
use of alcohol.  
(b) A Player is arrested or charged by law enforcement authori-  
ties with a criminal violation in which the authorities allege  
that the use of alcohol may have been a contributing factor in  
the misconduct.  
(c) A Player appears intoxicated during any of the Club’s games,  
practices, workouts, meetings or otherwise during the course  
and within the scope of his employment.  
240  
(d) Club medical personnel reasonably suspect that the Player  
may suffer from an alcohol use problem.  
(e) A Player is charged by law enforcement authorities with a  
crime involving the use of physical force or violence, includ-  
ing but not limited to, resisting arrest, battery, and assault.  
Any Player who is referred to the Treatment Board will be evalu-  
ated by the Medical Representatives of the Treatment Board in the  
case of an alcohol use problem, or by a neutral expert selected by  
the Medical Representatives of the Treatment Board in the case of  
off-field violence. The purpose of the initial evaluation 1s to deter-  
mine whether the Player could benefit from a Treatment Program,  
and if so, the type of Treatment Program that would be most  
effective for the Player involved.  
A Player’s participation in any Treatment Program 1s voluntary. A  
Player’s failure to participate in any Treatment Program shall not  
subject the Player to discipline. A Player’s referral to the Treat-  
ment Board is not intended to supplant any right a Club or the  
Office of the Commissioner may have under the UPC or Basic  
Agreement to discipline a Player for his conduct, or any potential  
defenses of the Player or the MLBPA to such discipline. The  
Player’s participation in any Treatment Program shall be consid-  
ered as a mitigating factor in any discipline imposed by either the  
Club or the Office of the Commissioner.

MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYER TOBACCO POLICY  
   
A. PROHIBITIONS  
1.  
Ballparks Subject to State or Local Ordinance. Effective  
December 1, 2016, the use of all tobacco products—including  
smokeless tobacco, cigarettes, and e-cigarettes (collectively,  
“Tobacco Products”)—by Players is prohibited in any ballpark  
where such use is prohibited by state or local law or ordinance  
(“Prohibited Ballparks”). This prohibition shall apply on-field  
during games. For purposes of this policy, “on-field” shall  
include all areas of the ballpark that are visible to fans and/or  
broadcast cameras (e.g., the playing field, dugout, and bullpen).  
The Clubs who play in Prohibited Ballparks, as of December  
1, 2016, are: Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White  
Sox, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers,  
Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, New York Yankees,  
Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants,  
and Washington Nationals. All Prohibited Ballparks will be  
required to comply with all signage and notification require-  
ments of the applicable state or local ordinance.  
Ballparks That Become Subject to State or Local Ordi-  
nance. If, after December 1, 2016, a state or municipality  
passes a law or ordinance banning the use of Tobacco Products  
in a ballpark that is not listed in Paragraph 1 above, the prohi-  
bitions in Paragraph 1 above shall apply in that new ballpark  
as of the date that new law or ordinance takes effect and that  
ballpark shall thereafter be considered a Prohibited Ballpark.  
In such an event, the Office of the Commissioner and the Play-  
ers Association shall send a joint memorandum to all Players  
notifying them of the new restriction.  
Players Without Major League Service Prior to 2017.  
Effective December 1, 2016, any Player who had no credited  
Major League service at the end of the 2016 season (i.e., a  
Player who makes his Major League debut during the 2017  
season or later) is prohibited from using Tobacco Products  
242  
on-field during games in every ballpark. In addition, such  
Players shall be prohibited from using Tobacco Products (1)  
during televised interviews, and (11) during Paragraph 3(b)  
appearances on behalf of the Club.  
Players With Major League Service Prior to 2017. In addi-  
tion to the restrictions on the use of Tobacco Products at Pro-  
hibited Ballparks set forth in Paragraphs | and 2 above, any  
Player who has been credited with at least one day of Major  
League service as of the end of the 2016 season 1s prohibited  
from using smokeless tobacco (1) during televised interviews,  
and (ii) during Paragraph 3(b) appearances on behalf of the  
Club.  
Requirement to Conceal. At any time when fans are permit-  
ted into any ballpark, all Players must conceal Tobacco Prod-  
ucts (including tobacco tins and packages) and may not carry  
Tobacco Products (including tobacco tins or packages) 1n their  
uniform or on their body.  
Penalties. The penalties for violating the prohibitions in  
Paragraphs | through 5 above shall be:  
(a) First Violation—Written warning and referral to the par-  
ties’ Smokeless Tobacco Cessation Consultant (the “Ces-  
sation Consultant’) to develop a Tobacco Cessation  
program (see Section C below).  
(b) Second and Subsequent Violations—A fine shall be issued  
for any second or subsequent violation in the amount spec-  
ified in the applicable state or local law or ordinance. In  
ballparks where no state or local law or ordinance applies,  
or where the ordinance does not provide a fine amount, the  
fine shall be $250 per violation.  
Violations will not carry over from year to year over the course  
of a Player’s career. All fines will be subject to challenge under  
the Grievance Procedure of the Basic Agreement. Fine  
amounts collected pursuant to this Policy shall be split evenly  
between (1) offsetting the cost of nicotine replacement thera-  
pies and/or other cessation services to Players; and  
(11) the Major League Baseball Players Trust.  
243  
B. EDUCATION  
1.  
The Parties, in conjunction with the Cessation Consultant, will  
create joint educational programs and materials for Players  
regarding the dangers of smokeless tobacco. Written materials  
will be distributed to all Players during each Spring Training  
of the Basic Agreement. The Parties also will develop an on-  
line educational program for Players regarding the dangers of  
smokeless tobacco and available cessation options.  
The Parties, in conjunction with the Cessation Consultant,  
will create joint educational programs and materials for the  
public (1.e., public service announcements) regarding the dan-  
gers of smokeless tobacco. These educational pieces will  
feature Major League Players and will focus on a youth audi-  
ence. These educational pieces will be played online on the  
Parties’ respective websites; during games in Major League  
ballparks; during broadcasts of the All-Star, post-season and  
World Series games; and during any other game broadcast on  
FOX, ESPN, TBS or the MLB Network pursuant to national  
broadcasting agreements entered into by the Office of the  
Commissioner.  
C. CESSATION  
l.

sation Consultant of a multi-disciplinary tobacco specialist  
network of professionals and organizations that provide confi-  
dential treatment options for tobacco cessation.  
Players who express interest in or who are referred for a  
Tobacco Cessation program pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) above  
will be provided with personal and confidential treatment  
options for tobacco cessation overseen by the Cessation Con-  
sultant.  
All Tobacco Cessation programs will include evidence-based  
tobacco treatment based on accepted clinical practice guide-  
lines including, but not limited to, counseling, individual or  
group therapy, recommendations for NRT, or other forms of  
treatment recommended by the Cessation Consultant. Costs of  
244  
Tobacco Cessation programs will be covered by the Major  
League Baseball Players Benefit Plan.  
4. NRT (e.g., patches, gums, lozenges) will be provided by the  
Parties in every Major League Clubhouse.  
D. ORAL EXAMINATIONS

Re: All-Star Game Usage for Sunday Pitchers  
Dear Rick:  
As you know, the Parties recently agreed to discontinue the “Sun-  
day Pitcher Rule” that previously appeared in Article XV(O)(4)(e)(1i1)  
of the 2012—2016 Basic Agreement. The purpose of this letter is to  
memorialize various understandings that the Parties have reached in  
order to protect the health and safety of starting pitchers who are  
elected or selected to an All-Star team and who make a start on the  
Sunday immediately preceding the All-Star Game (a “Sunday  
Pitcher”). The provisions of this letter shall apply only to pitchers who  
start a game on the Sunday immediately preceding the All-Star Game.  
1. pitcher who has a bona fide concern relating to his  
short-term or long-term fitness to play, may request either directly or  
through his Club any usage restriction that is reasonably necessary to  
accommodate such concerns (a “Usage Potential  
Usage Accommodations include, without limitation, an inning(s) limit,  
a limit on the number of batters faced, a pitch limit, availability for  
extra innings only, or no use at all. All requests for a Usage Accommo-  
dation—including, but not limited to, a request by a Sunday Pitcher to  
be held from the game entirely—must be submitted in writing to the  
Office of the Commissioner within 48 hours from the time the pitcher  
is named to the All-Star Game roster.  
2. Ifa starting pitcher who properly submitted a request for a  
Usage Accommodation becomes a Sunday Pitcher, the Office of the  
Commissioner will consider the following (without limitation) in  
determining whether to grant or deny the request:  
a. Time spent on the Disabled List in the current season or  
prior season, if any;  
247  
b. Any work-related surgery performed in the previous  
eighteen months, including but not limited to a ulnar col-  
lateral ligament reconstruction;  
c. Any innings limitations put in place by the Club for the  
current season;  
d. The workload of innings pitched in the current season  
and/or the prior season;  
e. Any information submitted by a Player’s Team Physi-  
cian, General Manager, Field Manager or Pitching  
Coach; and  
f. Any other relevant information.  
3. Ifa Usage Accommodation is granted by the Office of the  
Commissioner to a Sunday Pitcher, the specifics of the accommodation  
will be discussed and agreed upon by the Player in question, his Club  
and the Field Manager of the All-Star team in question, with any dis-  
putes resolved by the Office of the Commissioner after it consults with  
the Players Association. If a Sunday Pitcher obtains a Usage Accom-  
modation directing that he be held from the game entirely, he will be  
replaced on the roster but treated in the same manner as other All-Stars  
who are excused from participation, and he will also be encouraged to  
attend and be announced at the All-Star Game.  
4. For purposes of clarity, this letter supplements and in no way  
supersedes the exceptions to mandatory All-Star Game participation in  
Article XV(N)(3)(e)(1) of the Basic Agreement.

Dear Tony:  
This will confirm our agreement that the proper approach to calculat-  
ing the number of days that a Player is on optional assignment for pur-  
poses of calculating Major League service under the Basic Agreement  
is as follows:  
1. Players who are optioned and then designated for assign-  
ment while on option—The optional assignment date  
counts as day one of the option and the designated for  
assignment date is counted as the last day of the optional  
assignment.  
2. Players who are optioned and then released while on option  
—The optional assignment date counts as day one of the  
option and the date that the player is released from the 40-  
man roster is counted as the last day of the optional assign-  
ment.  
Pursuant to Article XXI(B), for a Player who is recalled from an  
optional assignment, whether the recall is to report or not to report, the  
date of the recall does not count as a day of the option unless the recall  
takes place after the start of any Minor League game in which the  
Player was eligible to play.

Season Club/Media Regulations (“Media Regulations”). See Attach-  
ment 34. The MLBPA shall also have the right to grieve an asserted  
failure by the Commissioner’s Office to enforce paragraph 12 of the  
Media Regulations. Nothing in this agreement shall alter whatever  
right the MLBPA may have (or may not have) to challenge under Arti-  
cle XI any other asserted violation of the Media Regulations, and this  
agreement is without prejudice to the Parties’ respective legal positions  
on that issue.

REGULAR SEASON  
CLUB/MEDIA REGULATIONS  
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL’  
The following are Major League Baseball’s regulations for Club/  
Media Relations. They are to be observed by all parties:  
l.  
All accredited press, radio and TV representatives shall have pre-  
game access to the clubhouse from three hours and 30 minutes  
prior to game time until one hour prior to game time, except that:  
(a) the media shall not have access to the clubhouse when a club  
is on the field for batting practice; and (b) the media may not  
return to a clubhouse once a club has taken batting practice. The  
media shall have pre-game access to the clubhouse for a minimum  
of 50 minutes prior to the time that a Club mandates that all play-  
ers take the field for batting practice or other related activities  
(e.g., stretching). If a Club does not take batting practice, it may  
not close the clubhouse until the media has been granted a mini-  
mum of 50 minutes of access. Unless necessary to satisfy the  
50-minute requirement, no Club may provide pre-game access  
prior to three hours and 30 minutes prior to game time. The media  
shall have access (outside of the clubhouse) to the Club’s man-  
ager, players or coaches after batting practice to discuss newswor-  
thy events (such as lineup changes, injuries, and workouts) that  
occur after the clubhouse closes.  
Absent unusual circumstances that require a team meeting imme-  
diately following a game, the working media shall have access to  
both clubhouses no later than 10 minutes following the final out  
of each game (including doubleheaders and day/night split admis-  
sion games). When such unusual circumstances exist, and such  
instances are expected to be rare, the working media shall have  
access to the clubhouse no later than 20 minutes following the  
final out of the game. The Commissioner’s Office reserves the  
right to require access to the clubhouse 10 minutes following the  
final out of all games if the “team meeting” exception is abused.  
  
The working media’s access following a game shall be for a  
period no longer than one hour unless reasonable access to play-  
ers 1s not provided during that time; provided, however, that card-  
carrying members of the Baseball Writers Association of America  
(“BBWAA”) will have unlimited access after the post-game open-  
ing of the clubhouse. If reasonable access is not provided, the  
clubhouse must remain open. Members of the media, other than  
BBWAA members, may make arrangements with the club PR  
Director for extended access.  
Media credentials are not transferable.  
Clubhouses, the dugouts and the field are off-limits except to  
appropriate club, Commissioner’s Office personnel and media  
bearing appropriate credentials. Club credentials are not to be  
issued to unauthorized personnel. The Commissioner’s Office  
reserves the right to revoke inappropriately issued credentials.  
Players will be available to the media before and after games for  
interviews. These periods should not be limited except for the pre-  
game period described in #1 above, and the post-game period  
described in #2, above. Upon request by the media, players who  
had key roles in the first game of a doubleheader are to be made  
available for a time between games.  
The trainer’s room and players’ lounge may be off-limits to the  
media, but each club controls these areas, and it is vital these areas  
not be used as a sanctuary for players seeking to avoid the media.  
It is very important to our game that ALL players are available to  
the media for reasonable periods and it is the player’s responsibil-  
ity to cooperate.  
Ropes or other restraining barriers are not permitted to bar the  
media.  
A general code is to be observed by the media so uniformed per-  
sonnel may do their work unimpeded. Media are to be allowed in  
foul territory, in an unrestricted manner, in an area that is to be not  
less than the territory between first and third bases, and which ter-  
ritory includes the area around the batting cage, except the dirt  
area around the batting cage.

Under no circumstances shall any club discriminate in any fash-  
ion against an accredited member of the media based upon race,  
creed, sex or national origin.  
Physical abuse or threats directed to members of the media  
(and/or official scorers) by baseball personnel will not be toler-  
ated. Disciplinary action, including fines and suspensions, will be  
considered in any cases that arise. While in the clubhouse, mem-  
bers of the media are expected to be doing business. Members of  
the media are expected to conduct themselves in a professional  
manner and to respect the privileges and environment of restricted  
areas and working press areas at all times. Any media member in  
violation of this conduct policy is subject to revocation of his or  
her privileges and may be subject to immediate ejection.  
Visitors in the clubhouse, including accredited media members,  
should conduct themselves in a professional manner. There shall  
be no seeking of autographs, no touching or removing of equip-  
ment or personal items from lockers, and no sampling of players’  
food spreads. Clubhouses are work places. Clubhouse business  
should be conducted as expeditiously as possible with a minimum  
of disruption of regular game routines. Members of the media  
should not excessively linger in the clubhouse when not inter-  
viewing players. Members of the media who violate the code of  
conduct set forth in this paragraph shall be subject to sanctions,  
including the loss of their accreditation as provided for in para-  
graph 17 below.  
Live TV and/or radio interviews with uniformed personnel during  
the course of a game are not authorized or permitted, nor is attach-  
ing a microphone to any uniformed personnel permitted without  
approval from the Commissioner’s Office. Microphones may not  
be placed in or adjacent to dugouts and/or bullpens in a manner  
that will allow uniformed personnel’s remarks or conversations to  
be overheard during the course of a game without the prior  
approval of the Commissioner’s Office.  
   
Live telephone interviews are not allowed from the clubhouse or  
the field without prior approval of the club. Mobile telephones  
with digital photography capabilities are prohibited.  
254  
15.  
16.  
17.  
Telephones from both dugouts to the press box are to be main-  
tained in working order for the purpose of providing information  
regarding special circumstances to the media during the course of  
a game. Explanations of injuries should be made as soon as pos-  
sible (to both the media and fans in the stadium).  
BBWAA members are not required to sign in for clubhouse or  
other restricted area access but may be logged in by club person-  
nel, subject to individual club policies. Other accredited media  
may be required to sign in for clubhouse access, subject to indi-  
vidual club policies.  
Any club whose personnel violate these regulations will be disci-  
plined. Any member of the media who violates these regulations  
will lose his or her accreditation.

Dear Tony:  
This letter memorializes certain understandings that the Parties have  
reached during the negotiations over a successor to the 2012—2016  
Basic Agreement. This letter shall be admissible in any arbitration  
hearing involving an issue addressed herein.  
A Club has the right under Regulation 2 of the Uniform Player’s Con-  
tract (“UPC’’) to designate the doctors and hospitals furnishing medical  
care and hospital services to a Player for injuries sustained in the course  
and within the scope of his employment under his UPC. A Player is  
entitled under Article XIII(D) of the Basic Agreement to go to a doctor  
on the second medical opinion list for diagnosis and a second medical  
evaluation of an employment related illness or injury being treated by  
the Club physician. The Parties have had a disagreement regarding Club  
and Player rights when a second medical opinion doctor and a Club  
physician disagree on the appropriate course of treatment for a Player’s  
employment-related injury, including but not limited to disagreement  
over whether medical procedures not yet approved by the United States  
Food and Drug Administration qualify as “reasonable medical  
expenses” under Regulation 2 of the UPC. Without attempting to  
resolve this disagreement, the Parties will continue to attempt to avoid  
disputes that might otherwise arise between Players and Clubs in this  
area by, among other things, urging their constituents to agree upon a  
qualified third physician expert in the appropriate medical specialty  
who would resolve the dispute between the Club physician and the sec-  
ond medical opinion doctor as to the appropriate course of treatment.  
There have been other circumstances in which the Club physician and  
a Player’s second medical opinion doctor agree that a particular sur-  
gery is the appropriate course of treatment but the Player and Club dis-  
agree as to who should perform the surgery. While the Club has the  
right to designate the doctors and hospitals when a Player is undergo-  
256  
ing a surgery for an employment related injury, the Clubs understand  
the importance of a Player being comfortable with the physician per-  
forming any such surgery. As a result, the Office of the Commissioner  
will continue to advise Clubs that they should take a Player’s reason-  
able preferences into account when designating doctors to perform sur-  
gery under Regulation 2. As part of this commitment, the Office of the  
Commissioner will advise the Clubs that in no event should they force  
a Player to have a surgery performed by the Club physician but should  
instead, in any case in which a Player has objected to the surgery being  
performed by the Club physician, designate another physician to per-  
form the surgery.  
Finally, disputes have also arisen with respect to which travel costs are  
appropriately considered part of the “reasonable medical expenses” for  
which a Club is responsible under Regulation 2 of the UPC. The par-  
ties agree that for any surgical procedure, medical exam or other sim-  
ilar medical appointment conducted under Regulation 2, the Club shall  
be obligated to provide or reimburse first-class airfare for the player’s  
companion, but only when travel with a companion has been recom-  
mended by a treating physician. In addition, the Office of the Commis-  
sioner recognizes that “reasonable medical expenses” include actual  
and reasonable travel costs associated with required follow-up exami-  
nation(s) with the surgeon who performed covered surgery, and the  
Association, on the other hand, recognizes that “reasonable medical  
expenses” would not include travel costs incurred by a Player to see a  
doctor for routine examination(s) that could have been appropriately  
performed by a local doctor designated by the Club.

General Counsel  
Major League Baseball  
Players Association  
12 East 49th Street  
New York, New York 10017  
Dear David:  
This letter will memorialize our agreement regarding the assessment  
and management of concussions suffered by Major League Players.  
1. The following protocols will govern the assessment and manage-  
ment of concussions by each Club’s medical staff:  
A. All Players will undergo neurocognitive baseline testing dur-  
B.  
ing Spring Training or when they join a Club each season.  
If a Player is involved in an incident during a game that is  
associated with a high risk of concussion, the game will be  
stopped and the Player will be evaluated on the field for a  
potential concussion by a Certified Athletic Trainer (“ATC’’)  
following the National Athletic Trainers’ Association  
(“NATA”’) guidelines for management of sports-related con-  
cussions.  
If the ATC detects any sign and/or symptom of a concussion  
during an on-field evaluation, the Player will be removed  
from the game and brought to the clubhouse for further eval-  
uation.  
i. A Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (“SCAT3’)  
assessment will be performed in the clubhouse by the  
ATC and/or the Club Physician to determine if a concus-  
sion has occurred. A copy of the SCAT3 form, which  
must be completed during the assessment, is attached  
hereto as Exhibit A.  
u. If the SCAT3 assessment determines that a concussion  
has not occurred, serial examinations will be performed  
between innings for the remainder of the game. If the  
SCAT3 assessment determines that a concussion has  
occurred, the Club, in consultation with the ATC and the  
258  
Club Physician, will determine if the concussed Player  
should be placed on a Disabled List (“DL”), and if so,  
which one.  
D. Ifthe ATC does not detect any sign and/or symptom of a con-  
cussion during the on-field evaluation, the Player may  
remain in the game, but serial examinations should be per-  
formed between innings for the remainder of the game. Any  
change in the Player’s neurological status will result in  
immediate removal from the game and further evaluation in  
the clubhouse.  
The Parties will establish a 7-day DL solely for the placement of  
Players who suffer a concussion. The following protocols will  
govern the placement of a concussed Player on the 7-day DL:  
A. Players are eligible for the 7-day DL only if they suffer an  
acute concussion.  
B. The occurrence of the injury, including all of the relevant  
details, must be documented through an Event Form in the  
Electronic Medical Records System.  
C. In lieu of a Standard Form of Diagnosis, which is required to  
place a Player on the DL under Article XIII(C) of the Basic  
Agreement, the ATC and the Club Physician will prepare and  
submit simultaneously to the Office of the Commissioner and  
the Players Association a concussion-specific diagnostic form  
that includes the following information: (1) the date and mech-  
anism of the injury; (11) the signs and symptoms of impair-  
ment; (iii) confirmation that a SCAT3 assessment was  
performed by an ATC and/or a Club Physician, and that the  
assessment indicated a concussion had occurred; and (iv) the  
basis for diagnosis of a concussion. Copies of the concussion-  
specific diagnostic forms for 7-day and 10-day DL place-  
ments are attached hereto as Exhibits B and C, respectively.  
D. The concussion-specific diagnostic form and any supporting  
information (including, but not limited to, the completed  
SCAT3 form) must be submitted to 7dayDL@mlb.com, and  
the Players Association must confirm receipt in writing  
(which it will do promptly), before the Player may be placed  
on the 7-day DL. MLB’s Medical Director will review the  
259  
information as soon as it is received, and inform the Com-  
missioner’s Office if the 7-day DL placement is approved.  
The Commissioner’s Office will then simultaneously  
inform the Players Association and the Club of the approval  
and enter the 7-day DL placement into eBis. If the Medical  
Director or the MLBPA expert questions whether the Player  
qualifies for the 7-day DL, they shall consult with each  
other as well as one of the outside experts on the Commit-  
tee prior to making his decision. In the event the Medical  
Director and the MLBPA expert are unable to agree on the  
approval of the 7-day DL placement, they shall refer the  
matter to an independent expert selected by the Parties, who  
will determine in his sole discretion whether the placement  
should be approved.  
Except for rehabilitation assignments as described in Para-  
graph 2(F) below, a Player placed on the 7-day DL will be  
treated the same as a Player placed on the 10-day DL for all  
purposes, including roster limits, transfers to the 60-day DL,  
etc. Ifa concussed Player is not able to return to play in seven  
days, the Player may be recertified for a subsequent place-  
ment on the 7-day DL. Any Player on the 7-day DL for more  
than 9 days will be transferred automatically and retro-  
actively to the 10-day DL, effective with the first day of the  
initial placement, and with the prior 9 days applying to the  
initial 10-day minimum period.  
A concussed Player on the 7-day DL who has been cleared to  
return to play may then consent to an assignment to a Minor  
League affiliate of his Club under the terms of Article  
XIX(C)(3), except that such assignment shall not exceed five  
(5) days for non-pitchers and eight (8) days for pitchers,  
unless the Player is not able to return to play within 14 days  
of the initial 7-day placement, in which case the maximum  
periods shall be 20 and 30 days, respectively.  
If the Club, in consultation with the ATC and the Club Physician,  
decides to place a Player on the 10-day or 60-day DL for a concus-  
sion, the Club must prepare and submit simultaneously to the  
Office of the Commissioner and the Players Association the con-  
cussion-specific diagnostic form rather than the Standard Form of  
260  
Diagnosis that is required under Article XIII(C) of the Basic  
Agreement. However, a Club may place a Player on the 10-day or  
60-day DL for a concussion without the prior approval of the Com-  
missioner’s Office that is required for placement on the 7-day DL.  
Before any Player that has suffered a concussion is permitted to  
return to play in any game, regardless of whether the Player was  
previously placed on a DL for such injury, the Club must submit  
a “Return to Play” form and the supporting certifications and doc-  
ument referenced below, to MLB’s Medical Director and the Play-  
ers Association, and the Players Association must confirm receipt  
in writing (which it will do promptly). The Return to Play Form,  
a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D, must contain the  
following certifications by the Club Physician and the ATC: (1) all  
symptoms have resolved; (11) ImPACT testing has returned to  
range of baseline; (111) the Player experienced no symptoms with  
exertion and baseball-related activities; (iv) the SCAT3 is within  
normal limits; and (v) the Club Physician has cleared the Player  
to participate in baseball activities. The Return to Play form must  
also be accompanied by the documentation supporting these cer-  
tifications, including, but not limited to, copies of all ImPACT and  
SCATS3 tests (including the SCAT3 from the time of injury), the  
current neurocognitive test score, the baseline neurocognitive test  
scores, and any reports by the Club Physician and the ATC.  
If the Medical Director or the MLBPA expert questions whether  
the Player should be returned to play, they shall consult with each  
other as well as one of the outside experts on the Committee prior  
to making a decision. In addition, the Medical Director may direct  
the Club to have the Player evaluated by an MLB-approved MTBI  
specialist in the Club’s home city before the Player is permitted to  
return to play. In the event the Medical Director and the MLBPA  
expert are unable to agree on the Player’s return to play, they shall  
refer the matter to an independent expert selected by the Parties,  
who will determine in his sole discretion whether the Player  
should return to play.  
The Commissioner’s Office will conduct an orientation for Club  
medical staffs regarding the protocols described herein, and will  
arrange training and education sessions for Club personnel  
throughout the course of the season and during the off-season, in  
261  
which Players Association officials may participate. Club person-  
nel will also be advised of concussion-related continuing education  
sessions conducted by the NATA and other national organizations.  
Finally, the Commissioner’s Office and the Players Association  
will jointly create and distribute educational materials for Players  
on the assessment and management of concussions, including a  
Concussion Information Sheet and a joint memorandum.  
This agreement shall constitute an “agreement” within the mean-  
ing of Article XI(A)(1)(a) of the Basic Agreement. In the event a  
Grievance is filed pursuant to Article XI of the Basic Agreement  
alleging non-compliance with the terms of this agreement, the  
Club, the Player involved, the Commissioner’s Office and the  
Players Association will cooperate in scheduling the handling of  
such Grievance so that it may be submitted to arbitration on an  
expedited basis, consistent with the procedures in Article XI gov-  
erning grievances involving Player safety and health.  
The Parties will mutually agree upon a report to be compiled  
annually by the epidemiologist that will provide a summary of  
concussion activity for the preceding season, including the num-  
ber of events, the circumstances attendant thereto, and the results  
of any treatment programs. Within 30 days of the issuance of the  
report, the Parties shall meet to discuss the report’s contents and  
to review the functioning of the protocols and procedures estab-  
lished by this agreement.

II. Balance Examination  
A.  
Modified Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) Testing  
i. Double Leg Stance: “Stand with your feet together with  
your hands on your hips and your eyes closed. Try and  
maintain stability for 20 seconds. I will count the times  
you move out of this position.”  
i. Single Leg Stance: “Stand on your non-dominant foot.  
Try to maintain stability for 20 seconds with your hands  
on your hips and your eyes closed. I will count the num-  
ber of times you move out of this position.”  
ii. Tandem Stance: “Stand heel-to-toe with your non-dom-  
inant foot back and your weight evenly distributed  
across both feet. Maintain stability for 20 seconds with  
your hands on your hips and your eyes closed. I will be  
counting the number of times you move out of this posi-  
tion.”  
Balance Testing Errors: 1) Hands lifted off iliac crest; 2)  
Opening eyes; 3) Step, stumble or fall; 4) Moving hip into  
> 30 degrees abduction; 5) Lifting forefoot or heel; or 6)  
Remaining out of test position > 5 seconds.  
Each of the three 20-second tests is scored by counting the  
errors accumulated by the player. The maximum total num-  
ber of errors for any single condition is 10.  
IV. Coordination Examination (Upper Limb Coordination)  
A.  
Finger-to-Nose (FTN) Task: “Please sit comfortably with  
your eyes open and your arm outstretched, pointing in front  
of you. When I give you the start symbol, perform five succes-  
sive FTN repetitions using your index finger to touch the tip  
of your nose, and then return to the starting position, as  
quickly and as accurately as possible.” Scoring: 5 correct  
repetitions < 4 seconds = 1.

Dear David:  
This letter will memorialize our agreement on “mini-camps.”  
1.  
Mini-camps shall be limited to workouts and activities designed  
to acclimate players to a Major League clubhouse (e.g., seminars  
on handling the media, team-building exercises, casual group  
activities, etc.). Clubs may not negotiate or attempt to negotiate  
directly with a Player his salary or other terms of a Uniform  
Player’s Contract (“UPC’’) during a mini-camp.  
Clubs may hold mini-camps that include 40-man roster Players  
for no more than seven days during the month of January. The  
mini-camp must be located at the Club’s Spring Training facility or  
in the Club’s home city and must be completed before February 1.  
The only 40-man roster Players who may be invited to attend a  
mini-camp are those with less than three years of Major League  
service who also are not eligible for salary arbitration that year  
(“Eligible Invitees”). No more than 15 Eligible Invitees may be  
invited to a Club’s mini-camp.  
Attendance by 40-man roster Players at a Club’s mini-camp 1s  
purely voluntary. The Parties acknowledge that it is essential to  
this agreement that Clubs refrain from any activity which suggests  
that invitations to mini-camps are anything less than entirely up to  
the Player. There will be no consequences to an Eligible Invitee if  
he decides not to attend.  
On or before December 15, the Club must identify for the Office  
of the Commissioner any 40-man roster Players that the Club  
wishes to invite to attend mini-camp in January. The Office of the  
Commissioner, in turn, will inform the Association of which  
Clubs intend to conduct mini-camps and identify any 40-man  
roster invitees.  
Zid  
All invitations sent to 40-man roster Players to a Club’s mini-  
camp must come exclusively through the Office of the Commis-  
sioner in the form of the following standard invitation letter, a  
copy of which shall be provided to the Players Association con-  
temporaneously with the invitation to the Player:  
On behalf of the Club, you are hereby invited to attend a  
mini-camp that the Club will hold at the following dates,  
times and locations. First-class jet air and hotel accommoda-  
tions, if practicable, will be provided. Please be advised that,  
pursuant to Attachment 37 of the Basic Agreement between  
the 30 Major League Clubs and the Major League Baseball  
Players Association, attendance at this mini-camp is purely  
voluntary. There will be absolutely no consequences if you  
decide not to attend.  
Please let me know by January 1 whether you plan to attend the  
mini-camp. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  
Clubs may not follow-up on the invitation of a 40-man Player  
either in writing or verbally, or either directly or indirectly (e.g.,  
through an agent). The Office of the Commissioner will coordi-  
nate any logistical follow-up that is necessary. However, if a  
Player responds directly to the Club rather than the Commis-  
sioner’s Office, the Club may then proceed to coordinate travel  
plans and inform the Player of any other pertinent details.  
Nothing herein is intended to restrict or otherwise modify a Club’s  
rights under Regulation 2 to prescribe or direct treatment for, or  
otherwise follow-up on the health or medical condition of, an  
injured player during the off-season.

from including as a Special Covenant to a Uniform Player’s Contract

the same terms for a particular benefit that the Club provides to another

Re:  
Social Media  
Dear Dan:  
I write to confirm our agreement concerning the Office of the Commis-  
sioner’s adoption of a policy addressing certain limitations on the uses  
of Social Media by employees, including Players (the “Policy’”’).  
1.  
The Players Association will not challenge in any forum the  
Office of the Commissioner’s implementation of the Policy, or the  
facial validity of its prohibitions.  
No Club may maintain its own policies restricting the use of  
Social Media by Players. Nothing in this agreement is intended to  
restrict Club or Commissioner’s Office policies encouraging the  
use of Social Media.  
A Player may be disciplined by either the Commissioner or his  
Club for a violation of the Policy, but not by both for the same  
conduct. All discipline under the Policy by a Club or the Com-  
missioner must be for just cause in accordance with Article XII  
of the Basic Agreement. In any grievance involving the disci-  
pline of a Player for an alleged violation of the Policy, the Asso-  
ciation agrees it will not challenge the reasonableness of the  
applicable aspect(s) of the Policy involved, but reserves all of its  
other defenses in any such grievance, including the right to  
assert that the amount of discipline imposed is not supported by  
just cause.  
This agreement shall not be used by either party as precedent or  
in support of its position in any proceeding or dispute other than  
a proceeding involving an alleged violation of its terms. More-  
over, this agreement and the Policy itself (including the defini-  
276  
tions therein) shall not be cited and shall have no consequence in  
any negotiation or business transaction involving the Parties.  
Very truly yours,

Dear David:  
The purpose of this letter is to confirm our understanding that on or  
before March | of every year, the Office of the Commissioner shall  
issue a memorandum to all Major League Chief Financial Officers  
reminding the Clubs of their obligations under Articles VIH(B)(5) and  
VII(C)(7) of the Basic Agreement, and stating that the Clubs should  
(1) treat as income for tax purposes only that portion of the daily in-  
season meal and tip allowances (Article VII(B)(3)) that are over the  
federal per diem rate for meals and incidental expenses for the city to  
which the Club has traveled; and (2) treat as income for tax purposes  
only that portion of the Spring Training allowances (Article VII(C)(1),  
(2) and (4)) that are over the federal per diem rate for lodging, meals  
and incidental expenses.

Dear David:  
This will confirm our agreement that Clubs and Players are prohibited  
from including as a Special Covenant to a Uniform Player’s Contract  
(“UPC”) a provision that gives the Club the right to void a guaranteed  
year of the contract based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of cer-  
tain events.  
Nothing herein is intended to preclude Clubs and Players from agree-  
ing to include as a Special Covenant to a UPC an option to extend the  
term of a guaranteed contract, including an option that vests as a result  
of the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain events. Moreover, the  
Parties reserve their legal positions regarding the enforceability of any  
other Special Covenants to a UPC, including but not limited to Special  
Covenants that limit the extent of a guarantee or otherwise permit the  
Club to convert the UPC into a non-guaranteed contract.
