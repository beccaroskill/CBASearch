No item can be used against or to the  \ndetriment of an employee unless it is in his/her personnel file.  \nAn employee may, after receipt of such filed document, file a statement of reaction to that item. The  \nemployee shall provide a copy to the personnel office, and such copy shall be placed in the employee's  \npersonnel file.

An administrator or designee must  \nbe present when the file is reviewed. An employee may request and receive at district expense a reproduction  \nof any item in his/her personnel file which does not contain the employee's signature. An employee may  \nrequest and receive at the employee's expense (in accordance with Florida State Statute, Chapter 119), a  \nreproduction of any item in his/her personnel file which contains the employee's signature.  \nThe employee may request that a representative of the Association accompany him/her at any time the file is  \nbeing reviewed by the employee. On written and signed authorization, the employee may permit any  \ndesignated person to examine the file without the employee being present.  \nUnless an employee leaves without notice, no documents or other material may be added to an employee's  \npersonnel file after the last day of employment, except for regularly required forms and records that might be  \nconnected with termination.  \nThe placement of any item in the personnel file of an employee which violates this Agreement or which is  \nincomplete or inaccurate shall be subject to the grievance procedure of this Agreement, to have such item  \nremoved from the personnel file. If itis decided that the item 1s to be removed and the item is contained on  \npaper or other hard copy, the item will be expunged from the file, destroyed and be of no use whatsoever. If  \n12  \nthe item to be removed 1s electronically filed or filed on film, the item will be blocked from view permanently  \nand be of no use whatsoever. In either case, the removed/blocked item will not be used to the detriment of the  \nemployee.  \n7. Uponreceipt of the written request of an employee, any item or notation in an employee's personnel file which  \nreflects adversely upon that employee and has been in said file for two (2) years, shall be removed if the  \nemployee has not repeated the action/inaction which led to the filing of the original adverse action within  \nsuch two (2) year period of time. Exceptions to this provision are when the item or notation constitutes  \nmaterial specifically required to be maintained in the employee's personnel file by law and/or by rules and  \nregulations of a State Agency.  \n8. |Anemployee shall be notified in writing each time someone seeks any personnel information concerning such  \nemployee which is not of a routine administrative nature.

Chalkboard space in every regular classroom and a portable chalkboard for use in other than regular  \nclassrooms.  \n7. A dictionary in every classroom where requested.  \n8. A \"regular classroom\" shall be interpreted to exclude shops, laboratories, gymnasiums, cafeterias, field  \nhouses, and similar rooms and spaces. Employees using these spaces shall be provided with the items in  \nparagraph four (4) if they have no regular classroom assigned to them.  \n9. It is the intent of the Board to minimize, where possible, employees being given floating assignments. All  \nfloating assignments will be reviewed by the Principal and Employee Building Council annually. Each  \nfloating employee (employee with no exclusively assigned regular classroom) shall be provided a desk, file  \ncabinet, and suitable storage space.  \n13  \n10.  \nA photo-copying machine(s) will be available for the educational use of the employees covered by this  \nAgreement at each school. Employees will be permitted to use said machine(s) to provide sufficient copies of  \nmaterials as may be determined by the employee to be adequate for their classes/students and professional use.  \nThe building Principal has the authority to monitor the number of copies being made by an employee and to  \ninvestigate whether or not an employee is abusing this provision. If an abuse is determined, the Principal may  \ntake actions to curtail such abuse.  \nSECTION D - VENDING MACHINES IN EMPLOYEE'S LOUNGES  \nAt a faculty meeting during the preschool period, a majority of employees shall determine the purposes for which  \nany profits from vending machines in employee's lounges and workrooms will be spent.

Employees may be expected to  \nmaintain such machines.  \nSECTION E - PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS  \nI.  \nThe Board and the Association agree that payroll deduction services which are within the control of the Board  \nand accruing to employees, shall continue through this Agreement. The specific deduction types are: Credit  \nUnion, Tax Sheltered Annuities, Health Insurance, United Way, Income Protection, additional Life Insurance,  \nand any IRS Section 125 plan(s) which may be agreed to by the parties.  \nUnless stated to the contrary in other Sections of this Agreement, the amount deducted from the employee's  \nsalary shall be voluntary and no charge shall be made to the individual employee for these payroll deduction  \nServices.  \nPayroll deduction for the Association dues is provided for under \"Association Rights and Privileges\" located  \nelsewhere in this Agreement.  \nPayroll deductions for child support as required by Florida Statutes shall be deducted when mandated by the  \nappropriate legal authority.  \nIn the event the District has mistakenly overpaid an employee, such overpayment shall be brought to the  \nattention of the employee. In no case shall the payback be less than $25.00 per pay. Normally the payback  \ntime shall be equal to the time the overpayment error occurred, unless a large amount is involved in which  \ncase the parties shall mutually agree to a reasonable payback plan. Ifno mutual agreement can be reached, the  \nDistrict may institute a reasonable payback plan. As used in this paragraph, the word \"reasonable\" may be  \ngrieved through the grievance procedure of this Agreement starting at STEP TWO.  \nSECTION F - EMPLOYEE AUTHORITY AND PROTECTION  \nI.  \nDiscipline is the responsibility of all administrators, employees, and other personnel in the school. The Board  \nrecognizes its responsibilities to give support and assistance to employees with respect to the maintenance of  \ncontrol and discipline in the classroom.  \nStudent discipline is based upon the premise that students must adhere to the Student Code of Conduct of their  \nrespective school, to conform to other regular and special rules, regulations and established routines of the  \nschool, and to comply with reasonable instructions from all employees.  \n14  \nThe Student Code of Conduct and disciplinary procedure shall be provided to all employees during the  \npreschool period by school center Principals.  \nEmployees and administrators jointly assume the responsibility for taking a positive approach to discipline  \nand to maintain constructive class/student control. An employee may impose prudent class/student discipline  \nconsistent with the school's Student Code of Conduct and disciplinary procedure and may take other prudent  \nactions as may be necessary to protect himself/herself from attack or to prevent injury to another student. Any  \ndiscipline imposed by an employee must be consistent with Board Policy and State and Federal Law.  \nEmployees and other school authorities will endeavor to achieve correction of student misbehavior through  \ncounseling, interviews, and conferences, which, when warranted, shall be extended to include the student's  \nparents or guardians.  \nIn order to facilitate better coordination between the Principal and the employee regarding disciplinary action  \ntaken by the employee and the Principal, each school shall use a Student Conduct Report. The employee shall  \nuse this report to maintain an adequate record of class/student discipline. The Principal shall use this report to  \nadvise the employee of the action taken. When completed, the Student Conduct Report will show all  \ninformation relative to the discipline problem including its disposition. In those cases where the employee  \nfeels that a parent/guardian conference would be helpful prior to final disposition of a discipline case, the  \nemployee will so note on the Student Conduct Report. If the Principal concurs, the Principal shall schedule  \nthe requested conference as soon as feasible. If the Principal does not concur, the Principal will consult with  \nthe employee before the final disposition.  \na. An employee may temporarily exclude a student from his/her supervision when the severity of the  \noffense, the persistence of the misbehavior, or the disruptive effect of the behavior makes the continued  \npresence of the student intolerable. Such student shall be sent to the Principal. In such cases, the  \nemployee shall furnish in writing to the Principal as promptly as his/her duties will allow, but no later  \nthan the end of the workday, full particulars on the problem or incident including a request for an  \nemployee/Principal consultation regarding the date and conditions of the student's return, if the  \nemployee deems such consultation to be in the best interests of the student or class. If consultation is  \nrequested by an employee, a conference shall be held prior to the student's return to the classroom. The  \nfinal determination of when and under what conditions the student will be readmitted to the classroom  \nshall be determined by the Principal after the foregoing conditions have been met. An exception to this  \nprovision may occur at an elementary school when an alternative procedure is mutually determined by  \nthe Principal and the EBC.  \nb. The parties agree to conform to Florida Statute 232.271 and 232.272, with regard to removal of students  \nas follows:  \n(1) An employee may remove from class a student who has been documented by the teacher to  \nrepeatedly interfere with the teacher\u2019s ability to communicate effectively with the students in the  \nclass or with the ability of the student\u2019s classmates to learn; or whose behavior the teacher  \ndetermines is so unruly, disruptive, or abusive that it seriously interferes with the teacher\u2019s ability  \nto communicate effectively with the students in the class or with the ability of the student\u2019s  \nclassmates to learn.  \n(2) Ifateacher removes a student from class under subsection (b), the Principal may place the student  \nin another appropriate classroom, in in-school suspension, or in a dropout prevention program as  \nprovided by 230.2316; the Principal may recommend the student for out-of-school suspension or  \n15  \nexpulsion, as appropriate. The student may be prohibited from attending or participating in  \nschool-sponsored or school-related activities. The Principal may not return the student to that  \nteacher\u2019s class without the teacher\u2019s consent unless the committee established under 232.272  \ndetermines that such placement is the best or only available alternative. The teacher and the  \nplacement review committee must render decisions within 5 days of the removal of the student  \nfrom the classroom.  \n(a) Any teacher who removes 25 percent of his or her total class enrollment shall be required to  \ncomplete professional development to improve classroom management skills.  \n(b) Eachschool shall establish a Committee to determine placement of a student when a teacher  \nwithholds consent to the return of a student to the teacher\u2019s class. Committee membership  \nmust include at least the following:  \n(1) Two teachers selected by the school\u2019s faculty; and  \n(141) One member from the school\u2019s staff who is selected by the Principal.  \n(3) The teacher who withheld consent to readmitting the student may not serve on the  \nCommittee. The teacher and the Placement Review Committee must render decisions within  \nfive days of the removal of the student from the classroom.  \nAny case of assault upon an employee which occurs in the line of duty shall be promptly reported to the  \nPrincipal. The Board shall provide legal advice to the employee concerning his/her rights and obligations  \nwith respect to such assault and shall render all reasonable assistance to the employee 1n connection with the  \nhandling of the incident by law enforcement and judicial authorities.

The injured employee shall  \nfully cooperate with the Board in the determination of the amount of any claim. Board liability for each  \nindividual case shall not exceed a cumulative total of $5,000.  \nWhere an employee is found guilty of a criminal charge directly related to the incident by a court of  \ncompetent jurisdiction, the Board shall be immediately released from further responsibility to the  \nemployee; however, if later the finding of guilt is overturned, the Board's responsibility shall be  \nreinstated immediately and, if appropriate, retroactively as it relates to Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of  \nparagraph 8 of this Section.  \nNo action shall be taken against an employee on the basis of a complaint by a parent/guardian or student  \nor other individual, nor shall any notice thereof be included in an employee's personnel file, unless the  \nmatter is first reported to the employee in writing. The employee shall have the right to attach a  \nstatement to the written complaint. Before any complaint is determined to be valid, it will be discussed  \nwith the employee in a conference. Once the investigation has been conducted, the employee shall be  \n16  \n10.  \n11.  \nadvised of any valid complaint.  \nWithout the consent of the employee and the Association, no action shall be taken against the employee  \non the basis of a complaint made against an employee without first following the procedures set forth  \nabove.  \n(1)  \n(2)  \n(3)  \nClothing: The District will rermburse an employee for clothing which is damaged, destroyed or  \nstolen as a result of an assault provided the employee is acting in the discharge of his/her duties  \nand within the scope of his/her employment when the assault occurred;  \nPersonal Property: The District will reimburse an employee for personal property which is  \ndamaged, vandalized, stolen or destroyed as a result of an assault which occurs while the employee  \nis acting in the discharge of his/her duties and within the scope of his/her employment.

After the conference, the employee  \nshall sign the completed evaluation form to acknowledge that it has been received. The employee shall have  \nthe right to initiate a written response to the evaluation which shall be made a part of the employee's official  \npersonnel file.  \n1. Procedures, criteria and forms contained in the District\u2019s revised 1999 Classroom Teacher Assessment  \nSystem (CTAS) Evaluation Handbook will be used in conducting the evaluation of teachers. The  \ncurrently approved CTAS Evaluation Handbook and instruments shall be used to evaluate guidance  \ncounselors and student services employees during the FY 00 school year.  \nAll employees will be provided with a copy of the revised 1999 CTAS Evaluation Handbook prior to initiating  \nthe evaluation process. The District\u2019s 1999 CTAS Evaluation Handbook 1s incorporated in and made a part of  \nthis Agreement by reference.  \nEmployees being evaluated with the competency assessment instrument may have more than one (1)  \npreliminary evaluation during the school year. Preliminary evaluations will be marked as \u201cother\u201d on the  \nevaluation form, and the final evaluation will be marked as \u201cannual.\u201d  \nOnly the evaluation form marked \u201cannual\u201d may be placed in the employee\u2019s personnel file.  \nEvaluations shall be performed only by certified administrative personnel employed and trained by the  \nDistrict. No bargaining unit member shall evaluate another member of the bargaining unit.  \nEach employee shall be formally observed by his/her Principal at least one (1) time prior to completion of the  \nfinal evaluation.

The parties agree that those employees being evaluated under the Accomplished Educator\u2019s Assessment  \n(AEA) already have an individual PDP as a part of the AEA, and will not be required to have another  \nplan so long as they are under the AEA.  \n2. Any training activity in the PDP must clearly be related to specific performance data for the students to  \nwhom the employee is assigned.  \n3. The PDP must include clearly defined training objectives.  \n4. |The PDP must include specific and measurable improvements in student performance that are expected  \nto result from the training activity.  \n5. | The PDP must include an evaluation component where principals must measure the extent to which each  \ntraining activity did accomplish the student performance gain that were predicted to result from the  \ntraining activity.  \n6. The parties agree to provide training and support for principals and employees concerning the  \nestablishment and implementation of PDPs.  \n7. The parties further agree to continue to work together and attempt to make the PDP process as simple  \nand understandable as possible.  \n19  \n18. a.  \nThe parties agree to authorize continuation of a joint committee of five (5) appointees from each party  \nto support implementation of the evaluation system and to recommend changes for refinement of the  \nsystem.  \nA subcommittee will be formed to review, study, and recommend changes to the evaluation system for  \nguidance counselors, and student services employees. The subcommittee will be comprised of two (2)  \nmembers from the evaluation committee from each party, and three (3) new members appointed by each  \nparty representing guidance and student services.  \nAll changes to the revised 1999 CTAS Evaluation Handbook will be submitted to both parties for  \napproval and shall be subject to the collective bargaining process unless both parties agree 1n writing.  \nThe Board agrees to provide TDEs for all committee members when meetings are conducted during  \nemployee duty time.  \nSECTION H - SAFETY  \nThe Board will make reasonable effort to provide and maintain working conditions which reasonably protect life,  \nsafety, and health of employees in the physical plants under control of the School Board.

Students enrolled in other exceptional student education (ESE)  \nprograms may also display behaviors that may require use of restraint.  \nSpecific physical restraint procedures also may be approved for use with other specific student populations  \nupon mutual agreement of the parties. Such agreements will be reviewed on an annual basis.  \nStrategies for the prevention of aggressive behavior shall be utilized on an ongoing basis. However, when  \nan explosive event occurs without warning and is of such degree that there is imminent risk to persons, the  \nuse of physical restraint techniques is authorized for such circumstances.  \nPhysical restraint refers to the use of physical intervention techniques designed to restrict movement of a  \nstudent in an effort to de-escalate aggressive behavior. In order to promote a safe learning environment, the  \nDistrict has authorized for implementation specific physical restraint procedures to be used in programs for  \nthe emotionally handicapped, severely emotionally disturbed and autistic. These specific procedures also  \nmay be used with other exceptional students when it is indicated on the student's Individualized Education  \nProgram (IEP). These procedures include, but are not limited to holding and escape techniques which when  \nimplemented, prevent injury to students and staff.  \nThe Board shall provide for the training of employees and support staff in physical restraint techniques as  \nwell as strategies for prevention of aggressive behavior. Training procedures developed for this purpose are,  \nby reference, incorporated and made a part of this Agreement.  \nHorizontal (floor) restraints are sanctioned only when the student 1s a danger to him/herself or others and  \ncannot be maintained using a less intrusive method. Personnel working with student(s) who may require  \nthis technique should be trained in District approved methods.  \nIf possible, a mat should be used when a student is placed in a horizontal (floor) restraint. Exceptions may  \nbe made in emergency situations when the potential for harm to the students 1s greater if the restraint is not  \nimplemented at all as opposed to implementing it without a mat.  \nWhen physical restraints are used, schools must maintain a log which includes the following minimum  \ncomponents:  \n24  \n10.  \n11.  \n12.  \n13.  \n14.  \n15.  \nl.

Employees shall not be required to remain longer than ninety  \n(90) minutes per month and not to exceed sixty (60) minutes at any one (1) meeting beyond the regular  \nworkday. In elementary schools, the EBC will conduct a vote of the employees to determine if these  \nfaculty meetings will be held during the regular workday or beyond the regular workday. If a majority  \nvote to hold these faculty meetings during the regular workday, this will require elementary employees  \nat that school to give-up part or all of their planning period on days such meetings begin during the  \nelementary workday. Forfeiture of these planning periods 1s in addition to the forfeitures set forth in 4  \n(b) above. In addition to Faculty Meetings as stated above, at the Principal\u2019s option, he/she may  \nschedule a faculty meeting for up to fifty-five (55) minutes on any or all Teacher Work Days as  \nspecified in the School Board calendar.  \nMeetings Prior To and On Holidays and Weekends - A meeting which takes place beyond the  \nemployees' duty hours and which requires attendance, as set forth in (a) above shall not be called on any  \n33  \nday immediately preceding a non-workday or on a non-workday.  \nc.

No employee will be expected to conduct a parent-teacher  \nconference with a hostile parent/guardian without the presence of an administrator. In addition, a Principal  \nmay request, but may not require employees to attend other after school, before school and/or evening  \nactivities. These employees who are requested and who voluntarily attend such activities will be granted  \nadditional compensatory time.  \nRecords of Compensatory Time and Supplemental Hourly Rate of Pay  \na. It is the responsibility of each employee to keep a verifiable written record of his/her earned  \ncompensatory time and to schedule the taking of such compensatory time with his/her Principal before  \nthe end of the school year during which compensatory time was earned.

The  \nPrincipal, however, shall have the authority for the assignment of employees within a school in keeping with  \nprovisions of this Agreement.  \nAn employee shall not be assigned to a grade level and/or subject area that is not within the scope of his/her  \ncertificate except in extenuating circumstances and with the specific approval of such out-of-field assignment  \nby the Chief Personnel Officer. The Chief Personnel Officer shall inform the Association, in writing, each  \ntime an employee is given an out-of-field assignment. The parties agree that all efforts will be taken to avoid  \nan out-of-field assignment without the affected employee's consent. Any employee who has an out-of-field  \nassignment shall not suffer a contract termination or non-reappointment by virtue of being assigned  \nout-of-field. An employee who 1s assigned out-of-field for more than one (1) period shall not remain assigned  \nto an out-of-field assignment for more than one (1) school year or partial school year without his/her consent.  \nWhen assigned to an out-of-field position, the evaluator of such employee shall note on the evaluation that  \nhe/she is in an out-of-field assignment.  \nSecondary employees shall not be assigned to more than two (2) distinct academic fields or be assigned to  \nmore than three (3) distinct preparations that can be distinguished by recognized differences in content and  \nthat require preparation time.  \nThe parties agree that enrollment shifts and other extenuating factors may prevent the finalization of  \nassignments prior to the opening of school. The parties also recognize that it is desirable for employees to  \nknow their assignments as soon as possible. Accordingly, each employee shall be given a tentative  \nassignment in writing for the next school year prior to the last day of duty for the current year. In keeping  \nwith the provisions of this Agreement, if changes in assignments must be made after the last duty day, the  \nadministration shall notify the employee by phone, with a follow-up by mail, within ten (10) calendar days of  \nthe change, in order to maximize preparation time.  \nIn keeping with the Memorandum Of Understanding agreed to by the parties on March 27, 2002, employees  \nwho are Experts-In-The-Field are provided the salary, benefits and all mghts afforded to other employees  \nrepresented by the Association to the extent permitted by law and rules of the Florida Department of Education.  \nSECTION D - EMPLOYEES WHO VOLUNTEER OR WHO ARE ASSIGNED DURING THEIR  \nPLANNING AND/OR COVERING ANOTHER EMPLOYEE\u2019S ASSIGNMENT  \nAs a result of negotiations during the 2001-2002 school year, the parties agree to modify the SUBSTTTUTE PILOT  \nPROGRAM (\u201cPROGRAM\u201d) in all schools whereby employees receive compensation for working as a substitute  \nduring their planning periods in secondary schools and for assuming additional students in elementary schools. The  \nterms of this modified PROGRAM are as follows:  \n1. The modified PROGRAM will go into effect upon employee ratification and School Board approval of  \nthis Agreement  \n2. Any employee wishing to volunteer to participate in the PROGRAM shall notify his/her Principal at  \nanytime after the effective date of the Program.  \n   \n3. A list of volunteers will be created and maintained at each school. The list of | volunteers shall be in  \norder of seniority, 1.e. length of continuous service within the bargaining unit.  \nA. Inthe event an employee is unable to secure a substitute from the substitute pool after following proper  \nprocedures to secure said substitute, volunteers will be asked to substitute on a rotating basis from the  \n35  \nseniority list.  \n5. The employee shall be paid ten dollars ($10) per period and twenty dollars ($20) per block in secondary  \nschools each time he/she substitutes during the term of this agreement. In elementary schools a total of  \nfifty dollars ($50) per day will be apportioned equally between or among employees covering an absent  \nemployee\u2019s class in the event the employee is absent for a full day. In the event an elementary employee  \nis absent for a half day, the apportioned amount will be twenty-five dollars ($25).  \n6. Any volunteer may opt out of the seniority rotation at anytime or decline to accept a substitute offer.  \nOpting out or declining an offer does not disqualify an employee from opting back in or remaining on the  \nsubstitute rotation list.  \n7. Inthe event no volunteers are available to cover an absent employee\u2019s class(es), the Principal may utilize  \nprovisions of paragraph 8. below.  \n8. a. Secondary Schools: Employees who lose their planning time when assigned by their Principal to cover  \nother employee\u2019s assignments when a day-to-day substitute cannot be assigned may be given  \ncompensatory time or have their planning period restored by the Principal within a two (2) week  \nperiod or at the first available opportunity, in modules of not less than thirty (30) minutes.  \nb. Elementary Schools: Employees may be assigned additional students by their Principal when an  \nemployee is absent and a day-to-day substitute teacher cannot be assigned. Employees who are  \nassigned additional students may be given compensatory time or be granted additional planning time  \nby the Principal within a two (2) week period or at the first available opportunity, in modules of not  \nless than thirty (380) minutes.  \nSECTION E - RESPONSIBILITY OF ABSENT EMPLOYEES  \nl.  \nThe employee who must be absent will notify the automated substitute locator system or the Principal's  \ndesignee according to the Principal's directive as soon as the need for the absence becomes known.

Interim employees shall not have the right to transfer and may be released from their employment with  \nseventy- two (72) hours advance written notice.  \n4. If an interim employee is later employed in a position as a regular employee, he/she shall no longer be  \nconsidered interim. A regular employee shall not be returned to interim status.  \n5. Interim employees who have satisfactorily fulfilled their responsibilities, as determined by their Principals,  \nwill be given first consideration when filling vacancies for which they are certified.  \nSECTION P - SECONDARY (MIDDLE, HIGH, VOCATIONAL, ALTERNATIVE, SPECIAL)  \nSCHOOL SCHEDULING  \n1. Employees in middle, high, vocational, alternative and/or special schools shall not be assigned to more than  \n4]  \nfive (5) periods per day as set forth in #4 below or a modified schedule as voted on by the faculty as outlined  \nin paragraph 7 of this article.  \nAn assignment of an employee in any such secondary school for a sixth period shall be by mutual agreement  \nof the employee and the Principal. However, in the event a volunteer is not available, the Board reserves the  \nright to assign an employee to an additional period (see #5 below).  \nThe length of the class period in a secondary school shall not be less than 50 minutes nor more than 55  \nminutes or a modified schedule as voted on by the faculty as outlined in paragraph 7 of this article.  \nThe regular daily schedule of each secondary employee shall consist of no more than five (5) assigned periods  \nwithin the seven (7) period instructional day for students or a modified schedule as voted on by the faculty as  \noutlined in paragraph 7 of this article. Of the remaining two (2) periods, one (1) shall be assigned for  \npurposes of planning, in accordance with Article HI, B, 4. The second period shall be used for planning and  \nother work related non-instructional activities of the employee; when necessary such activities may include  \nassigned school operation responsibilities which were traditionally managed before, during or after the student  \nday. Such assignments shall be equitably distributed.  \na. Employees in middle, high, vocational, alternative and/or special schools who are voluntarily or  \ninvoluntarily assigned a sixth period shall be compensated according to Appendix F. Should an  \nemployee work less than the entire year, the supplement will be prorated for the amount worked.  \nIn compliance with Article III, B, 4, secondary (middle, high, vocational, alternative, special) school  \nemployees such as counselors, media specialists, occupational specialists and other non-regular classroom  \nemployees in each secondary school will develop in cooperation with their Department Chair (or Team Leader  \nwhere a Department Chair is not a position in the school) a schedule which allocates planning time to such  \nemployees consistent with the amount of planning time classroom teachers are scheduled in that school on a  \nweekly basis.  \nIn those instances where either the Principal or such employee described in (b) above believes that scheduling  \nand planning time 1s not feasible due to the workload assigned the employee, a meeting will be held between  \nthe Principal and the employee. If the Principal and the employee agree that the workload assigned the  \nemployee is such that the assigning of planning time does not allow the employee sufficient time during  \nhis/her workday to meet the need of students, other teachers and parents, a sixth period supplement will be  \nawarded to the employee as set forth in (a) above.  \nIf an agreement cannot be reached between the Principal and such employee, the issue may be taken to the  \nEmployee Building Council at that school for review and recommendations.  \nIf a satisfactory solution cannot be reached at the school level, the Area Superintendent may be requested to  \nreview and resolve the matter.  \nPlanning time is defined as non-student and non-parent contact time during which such employees will not be  \nassigned specific responsibilities or duties except as provided in II, D of this Agreement. Departmental or  \nteam planning will not be considered a violation of this provision. Planning time is also defined as being  \nsomewhat different in nature from a classroom teacher\u2019s planning time. For example, a classroom teacher  \nmay elect to use planning time to grade papers. A counselor may choose to review a student\u2019s records and a  \nmedia specialist might review material orders during their planning time.  \n42  \n6. Vocational instructors assigned to teaching duties for six (6) hours per day shall be entitled to a supplement for  \nthe sixth hour.  \n7. In the event the administration wishes to modify scheduling, the building Principal will propose such  \nscheduling modifications to his/her respective Employee Building Council which will conduct a secret ballot  \nvote of all employees covered by this Agreement who are assigned to that building. Such employees may vote  \nto adopt the proposed scheduling modifications or to reject the proposed modifications. If adopted, the  \nduration of such scheduling modifications shall be no longer than the end of the first full school year after the  \nmodifications were adopted. Ifthe administration wishes to extend the scheduling modifications beyond this  \ntime period, another vote must be taken as set forth above.  \n8. The Board will have unilateral authority to adopt a secondary school schedule other than the seven (7)-period  \nday schedule. In the event the Board adopts a different secondary schedule, the procedures set forth in  \nparagraph 7 above will be the procedure used by the administration in the event the administration wishes to  \nmodify whatever new schedule the Board may adopt on a secondary school by secondary school basis.  \nFurther, the Board agrees to negotiate with the Association the impact on the Association's bargaining unit  \nmembers' terms and conditions of employment of any Board adopted change to the seven (7)-period day. To  \neffect these impact negotiations, the Board will notify the Association at least sixty (60) days in advance of the  \ndate the Board makes effective any change from the seven (7)-period secondary schedule. The Association  \nwill have the right to negotiate the impact of the new schedule and to renegotiate paragraph 4 above so it  \ncomplies with the new secondary schedule adopted by the Board.  \nSECTION Q - SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT  \nIn keeping with Florida Law, all school buildings are to be smoke-free. Adult smoking areas will be designated by the  \nPrincipal on the grounds of the school center. Such area will be at least fifty (50) feet from any exit door.  \nSECTION R - ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATION  \nWith the concurrence of the Association on an individual case by case basis, an employee shall be entitled, upon his/her  \nrequest, to have present an Association representative of his/her choice when the employee so requests in the event  \nsaid employee is to have any kind of meeting with a school administrator, a school police officer or agent thereof  \nwhich, in the opinion of the employee, may lead to some form of discipline being taken against the employee. The  \nrequest for the presence of a representative of the Association shall not delay such proceedings for more than two  \n(2) days unless in the judgment of the Principal an emergency exists which requires prompt attention. In cases of an  \nemergency, the meeting will be delayed two (2) hours while attempts are made to secure the presence of an  \nAssociation staff person to represent the employee. If an Association staff person cannot be secured within such  \ntwo-hour period, the Association Faculty Representative for the school will be present at the emergency meeting to  \nact as the employee\u2019s representative.  \nSECTION S - DISCRETIONARY FUNDS FOR SUPPLIES/EQUIPMENT  \nFunds designated to rermburse employees for expenditures for supplies will be allocated by the schools from their regular  \nsupply budgets. Principals will have the sole responsibility for determining how much will be allocated for this  \npurpose. Allocations are to be made on an employee-by-employee basis.  \nEmployees may voluntarily pool their individual allocations or portions of their allocations to make joint purchases, but  \neach employee in a pool must agree to the joint purchase before any part of his/her allocation can be expended.  \n43  \nAllocated funds not expended by the last day of school before Spring Break of any fiscal year will revert back to a  \nschool's regular supply budget and the Principal may expend such supply funds at his/her discretion during the  \nbalance of that fiscal year. No unexpended funds will be carried over from one (1) fiscal year to the next fiscal year.  \nReimbursement requests shall be made to the Principal. The request should include a detailed description of the purchase  \nand should be accompanied by an original invoice, receipt or register tape. In order to avoid confusion and delay,  \nemployees should not commingle reimbursable and personal purchases on the same invoice, receipt or register tape.  \nSales taxes will not be rermbursable; therefore, employees should provide vendors with the District's sales tax  \nexemption certificate number. However, since the sale will be to an employee rather than directly to the District,  \nemployees should be aware that vendors may not waive the charging of sales taxes.  \nReimbursement of employee purchases will be made from the school's petty cash funds. Schools will accumulate  \nreimbursement requests and forward them to Finance for replenishment of their petty cash funds in accordance with  \nestablished procedures governing petty cash. Amounts reimbursed to employees will be charged against the supply  \nbudget indicated by the school on the replenishment request.  \nThe EBC should be given the opportunity to comment on the allocation amount before it 1s finalized and announced to the  \nbuilding's employees. Employees are to be informed of their individual allocation amount at the time that the  \nprocedure is announced to them.  \nSECTION T - OUT-OF-BUILDING COMMUNICATIONS  \nAny employee required to conduct a class out-of-doors will be provided with a walkie-talkie if requested by said  \nemployee.  \nAll other employees who voluntarily conduct classes outside will be provided a walkie-talkie upon request if available  \nwithin the building.  \n"], ["ARTICLE IV - VACANCIES AND TRANSFERS  \nSECTION A - PLACEMENT PRIORITY CLASSIFICATIONS  \n", "Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the following procedures will be used when filling vacant or new  \npositions which are bargaining unit positions.

Therefore, if an individual employee has a personal complaint or  \ngrievance which he/she desires to discuss with a Principal, he/she 1s free to do so without recourse to the grievance  \nprocedure. Any adjustment of the complaint or grievance must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement.  \nThe parties agree that the informal procedure shall be utilized by the grievant and the lowest level administrator  \nhaving authority to resolve the grievance prior to invoking the formal grievance procedures. When invoking the  \nformal grievance procedures, the grievant shall file the grievance with the lowest level administrator having  \nauthority to resolve the grievance.

However, both parties by mutual consent  \n67  \nmay waive further discussion in STEP ONE and move the grievance to STEP TWO.

The mediator will be selected through a mutual agreement of the parties. There  \nwill not be a binding decision on the parties except by mutual agreement. If it is agreed to make the mediator's  \ndecision binding, the grievance will be considered resolved and may not be appealed to STEP THREE. Alternate  \nsolutions which are discussed/recommended at the STEP TWO-A level may not be utilized at STEP THREE by  \neither party.  \nPEP THREE  \nthe Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at STEP TWO or TWO-A, the grievance may be  \nsubmitted to arbitration before an impartial arbitrator within twenty-four (24) days thereafter, as hereinafter  \nprovided.
