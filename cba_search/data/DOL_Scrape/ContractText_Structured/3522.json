Except in the case of an emergency, Employees will notify their immediate  \nSupervisor as soon as possible, but not later than two hours after beginning of the work  \nshift, of the reason that prevented them, or will prevent them, from reporting to work on  \ntime. If the reason provided is illness of the Employee or qualified family member,  \nSupervisors cannot request that an Employee elaborate on the specifics of the medical  \ncondition. If the Employee is incapacitated and/or physically unable to initiate contact  \nhim/herself, then Management may accept tardiness or absence notice from an  \nEmployee's next of kin.  \n3. When an Employee cannot establish positive contact with their first level Supervisor,  \nthen Employees should attempt to make contact with their next level of Supervision, and  \ncontinue to do so, until a Management representative is reached, in order to provide  \nnotice. Co-workers cannot be used to relay information concerning tardiness or  \nabsence.  \n4. Tardiness and absence notices, regardless of the circumstances, should be provided  \nverbally by the Employee him/herself directly to a Management official. However,  \nEmployees may use other modes of acceptable modern communication, such as voice  \nmail, email, and/or text, as a secondary method of attempting to provide notice, or when  \nall efforts to verbally contact a Management representative have been reasonably  \nexhausted by the Employee.  \n5.

Overtime work is any activity that an Employee is required to accomplish or  \nparticipate in, including mandatory meetings or events scheduled and/or hosted by the  \nAgency or its representatives, which require an Employee to be present at the worksite  \nprior to their regular duty day begins, or require an Employee to remain at the worksite  \nafter their regularly duty day ends.  \n3. Overtime requirements will be announced as far in advanced as possible to allow  \nEmployees the opportunity to make suitable arrangements in order to perform the  \novertime work.  \n4. The Agency will make every effort to direct or assign Employees overtime on an  \nequal basis, and to accomplish overtime mission requirements with the least amount of  \nqualified personnel necessary to safely and successfully perform the mission. In no  \ncase will overtime work be directed or assigned to any Employee as a reward or  \npunishment.  \n5.

Call Back is the act or an instance of requesting that an off-duty Employee report to  \nwork and perform his duties on a day when work was not scheduled, or after their  \nregular work day is over.  \n2. Unscheduled call back work entitles an Employee to at least two (2) hours of  \ncompensatory time.  \n3. If an Employee is on scheduled leave and called back to work, a corrected OPM 71  \nLeave Request Form will be submitted to the Timekeeper upon the Employee reporting  \nto work.  \nSection 8.6 - Stand-By and On-Call Duty Compensation  \n1. In order to deal with situations occurring after regular duty hours, Employees may be  \nplaced on either a stand-by or on-cail duty status.  \n2. The Agency may establish routine prohibitions regarding alcohol consumption, and  \nmay restrict the use of specific prescription or over the counter drugs, in order to ensure  \nEmployees maintain the ability to perform work.  \n3. Stand-By Duty. An Employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of  \nwork if, for work related reasons, the Employee is restricted to a designated post of duty  \nand Is assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the  \nEmployees activities so substantial that the Employee cannot use the time effectively for  \nhis or her own purpose.

Tne Employee is allowed to leave a telephone number or to carry a phone for the  \npurpose of being contacted, even though the Employee is required to remain within a  \nreasonable call-back radius; or  \nb. The Employee is allowed to make arrangements such that any work which may  \narise during the on-call period will be performed by another person.  \nc.
