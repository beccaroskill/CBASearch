Such transfers to new or remodeled stores are subject to the mutual  \nagreement of the Employer. If two (2) or more employees request a transfer to a  \nstore, seniority shall apply.

Once the shift choice is made, neither the employee nor the Employer will  \narbitrarily change the shift. Such employees must advise the Employer and the  \nUnion, in writing, of their desire for day hours. Where two (2) or more employees  \nin the store make this request, seniority shall prevail. Such transfer requests shall  \nbe implemented within two (2) weeks of the date of request.  \nTransfers made other than each April and October shall be made under the  \napplicable provisions of the Agreement.  \nFull-time day employees shall have the right to refuse a transfer to a night stocking  \nand receiving crew and, in the event the employee refuses, it shall be considered an  \ninvoluntary reduction.  \nIf the Employer assigns an Assistant Store Manager to a night stocking and  \nreceiving crew, the Assistant Manager shall be in addition to the Head Night Stock  \nClerk.  \n43  \nFarmer Jack (Grocery)  \n2004 - 2007  \n"], ["ARTICLE 24  \nUNION COOPERATION  \n", "A.
