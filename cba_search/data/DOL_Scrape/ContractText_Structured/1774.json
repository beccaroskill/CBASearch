Effect of Other Agreements.  \nThe Provisions of this Agreement to be agreed upon between the Employer and the appropriate  \nUnion(s), shall apply to all work identified in Article I, Section 2, notwithstanding provisions of  \nNational Union Agreements which may conflict or differ with the terms of this Agreement.  \nSECTION 4. Subcontracting - Uniform Conditions  \na)  \nb)  \nCc)  \nd)  \nExcept as provided in paragraphs b and c & d below, the Employers agrees not to  \nsubcontract any work at the site of the construction covered by the terms of this  \nAgreement to any subcontractor unless said subcontractor agrees in writing to perform  \nsaid work subject to all terms and conditions of this agreement. Prime contractors shall  \nassure that subcontractors engaged to perform work under the terms of this Agreement  \nshall become signatory to this Agreement prior to performing said work. The Union  \nagrees to allow a subcontractor to be bound by the terms of this agreement, on that  \nwork [performed for an Employer on an individual project] without binding the  \nsubcontractor to this Agreement on any other work for the same or any other Employer.  \nWhenever the Employer is obligated to satisfy DBE-WBE recruiting requirements the  \nUnion and the Employer mutually agree to waive this provision prior to  \ncommencement of the work in the event an Employer and Union are unable to find  \nqualified competitive union minority subcontractors.  \nWhen potential union subcontractors are not available in the locality of the job site to  \nperform the work and/or where the general contractor receives no competitive union  \nbids, the Employer and the Union mutually agree that this provision Section 4 is fully  \nwaived.  \nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the Employer is entitled to designate a bid as non-  \ncompetitive when it is not the lowest bid.  \nIf requested, furnish the Union the name and address of said sub-contractor  \nimmediately upon awarding the sub-contract.  \nSECTION 5. Favored Nations.  \nIf the Union enters into any Agreement with any individual Employer or group of Employers  \nperforming work on any project or in any geographical area covered by the terms of this  \nAgreement and that Agreement provides for more favorable wages, hours or conditions to any  \nother Employer, the Employers signatory hereto, after sending written notice of such intention,  \nshall be afforded the privilege to adopt such advantageous terms and conditions with respect to  \nthat geographical area and/or project(s).  \nThe Union will provide the AGC with a true copy of any Agreement signed by any Employer  \nthat covers work recognized as field construction work that differs in any material way from the  \nworking terms and conditions or wages contained in this Agreement within five (5) calendar  \ndays of such signing.  \n"], ["ARTICLE Il  \nHIRING OF PERSONS  \n", "SECTION 1. Hiring Hall. |  \nThe Union agrees to maintain a hiring hall and to solicit qualified workers, both Union and non-  \nUnion, in order to fill necessary requisitions for workers.

Registration.  \nRegistration or re-registration of applicants for referral shall be accepted by the Union during its  \ncustomary hours. All applicants shall be registered in the order of time and date of registration.  \nTo remain on the registration list, an applicant for referral must renew their registration not later  \nthan ninety (90) days from the date of their last registration or re-registration.

Applicants from the \"B\" List in successive order as their names appear on the out-  \nof-work list, and when the \"B\" List is exhausted, then  \n3. The applicants from the \"C\" List and the remaining successive Lists in successive  \norder as their names appear on the out-of- work List.  \nb) Separate lists will be established and maintained for apprentice workers, and referrals  \nshall be made on the same basis as that for workers except that the experience conditions  \nset out in Section 1 of this Agreement shall, as to apprentice workers, not be applicable or  \nrequired.  \nc) Any applicant who is rejected by the Employer shall be restored to their place on the  \nappropriate list on which they are registered. When a worker quits a job of their own  \nvolition without good and sufficient cause they shall be registered at the bottom of the  \nappropriate list.  \nd) When a registrant is referred for employment and is actually employed on a job for one  \n(1) day such registrant's name shall be removed from the list. When their employment  \nterminates, they shall be registered at the bottom of the appropriate list on which they are  \ne)  \ng)  \nentitled to be registered.

In such an  \nevent, the Employer will notify the Union of the names and dates of such hiring\u2019s within  \nforty-eight (48) hours of such hiring\u2019s.  \nSECTION 8. Employment Clearance.  \na)  \nb)  \nTo avoid duplication of orders and to effect an orderly hiring procedure, the Employers  \nagree, when calling on the union for workers, to designate a responsible representative  \nfor each project whom the Union shall recognize as the agents of the Employers with  \nauthority so to hire. Furthermore, the Union shall be notified in writing as to the names  \nof the authorized representatives and the parties mutually agree that employment will be  \nmade only through such order.  \nThe Union and the Employer shall post, in places where notices to all Employees and  \napplicants for employment are customarily posted, all provisions relating to the  \nfunctioning of the hiring provisions of this Agreement.  \nSECTION 9. Registration Requirements.  \nThe Union will maintain a roster of job applicants and an Employee is eligible for registration on  \nthat roster as follows:  \nLIST A: Workers who are bona fide residents of Alaska and have worked in the trade  \nfor an Employer or Employers for an aggregate time of at least 400 hours  \nduring the last two years.  \nLIST B: Workers who have worked for such Employer or Employers in the trade for an  \naggregate time of at least 400 hours during the last two years.  \nLIST C: All other applicant workers for employment.  \nSECTION 10.

The criteria for establishing residency shall  \nbe determined by the Union.  \nSECTION 11. Drug and Alcohol Screening  \nWorkers required by the Employer to take a pre-employment drug and alcohol screening will not  \nbe on the payroll of the Employer during drug and alcohol screening if the procedure is identified  \nin the Employers policy and procedures manual. If the Employee is put to work while they are  \nawaiting the results they will be paid for time worked. The Employer will pay for all drug and  \nalcohol screening.  \nSECTION 12. Referral Disputes:  \nAny and all disputes arising out of work registrations, work referrals and the preparation of the  \nreferral registration lists will be submitted to the Union. Any applicant or registrant shall have a  \nright to present any dispute arising out of and relating to the operation or functioning of the job  \nreferral plan to the Union.  \nSECTION 13. Severability Clause: |  \nIt is not the intent of this Article to in any way violate State or Federal Law or regulation and the  \ndevelopment of any such situation shall be cause for immediate negotiations between the  \nsignatories to this Agreement to correct the language. In the event that, as a result of a charge or  \nsuit against any party to this Agreement (to include any member of the Associated General  \nContractors of Alaska, or any Employer who adopts and works under this Agreement), any  \nsection or provision hereof or the entire Agreement shall be declared or held to be invalid or  \nillegal by any authorized Board or Court, the part, section, provision or the entire Agreement so  \nheld or declared invalid or illegal shall forthwith cease to be of further force and effect and in  \nsuch event either party hereto may, upon not less than thirty (30) days written notice to the other,  \nhave the right to open negotiations for the substitution of a new section, sections, or agreement  \nconsistent with the decision of the Board or Court.  \n"], ["ARTICLE Ill  \nHIRING HALL COMMITTEE  \n", "SECTION 1.

Those who are not  \nmembers in good standing on the effective date of this clause shall, within fourteen (14) days  \nfollowing the effective date of this clause, become and remain members in good standing in the  \nUnion. Employees hired or covered by this Agreement subsequent to the signing of this  \nAgreement shall be required to become and remain members of the Union in good standing  \nwithin fourteen (14) days of hire or being covered. All requests by the Union for the dismissal of  \nany Employee for failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph shall be in writing.  \nThe Union agrees to defend any charge or suit made or brought against any Employer as the  \nresult of the dismissal or termination of any Employees pursuant to the provisions of this section  \nand to hold the Employer harmless.  \nSECTION 2. Checkoff of Dues.  \nThe Employers agree to deduct from the wages of each Employee such amount of the Union  \ndues and/or assessments owing by them to the Union, as may be certified by the Financial  \nOfficer of the involved Union, provided the Employee has executed a written assignment calling  \nfor such deduction. If an Employer transfers an Employee to a subsidiary and/or sister company,  \nor if an Employee is transferred by the Employer to a joint venture that is formed by the  \nEmployer, it is agreed that for purposes of Union dues and/or assessments, the Employee need  \nnot execute a new written assignment calling for such deduction. Consequently, the deductions  \nwill continue without interruption and will be forwarded to the Union by the Employer who is  \nthen paying the Employee. Such deductions shall be transmitted to the Union within fifteen (15)  \ndays following the end of each calendar month. Appropriate transmittal forms shall be supplied  \nto each Employer by the Union.

The Employer shall be informed of  \nthe names of the appointed stewards, in writing, and only such stewards will be accorded  \nrecognition by the Employer. The job steward shall be the last person terminated provided they  \nare qualified for the last work available on the job.
