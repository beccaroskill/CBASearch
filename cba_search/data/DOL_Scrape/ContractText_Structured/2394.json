Tuesday  \nthrough Friday. A 4X10 work schedule will only be offered during the period when U.S. Day Light  \n\u2018Savings Time is in effect. This work schedule will be on a volunteer basis. If the volunteers exceed the  \npositions available, the most senior volunteers will be selected for the available positions, An  \nemployee\u2019s selection for a 4X10 work week schedule will be for one Day Light Savings Time  \n\u201cseason\u201d and a new 4X10 work schedule will be offered in accordance with the procedure set forth  \nabove in each succeeding year during the term of the Agreement. When not on U.S. Day Light  \nSavings Time and the COMPANY implements a reduced hour schedule, those technicians who worked  \n4X10 work schedules during U.S. Day Light Savings Time will be scheduled off when and if their turn  \nin the mandatory day off rotation. schedule established by the COMPANY falls on a Monday,  \notherwise, their position in the mandatory day off rotation will be skipped.  \nWhen shift work is established, a normal shift shall consist of eight (8) hours a day for a 5-day work  \nweek schedule and ten (10) hours a day for a 4X10 schedule with work commencing at the start of  \neach shift.

This lunch period shall begin at least 2 % hours after  \nthe start of the shift and no later than 6 1/2 hours after the start of the shift.  \n7.4 Reasonable Overtime Requirement. Employees are required to work reasonable overtime.  \nReasonable is defined as 60% of the available overtime offered during a fiscal calendar quarter.

Any employee reporting for work upon the express or implied order of the  \nCOMPANY or its authorized representative and not put to work for any reason except weather  \nconditions, fire, accident or other unavoidable causes, shall receive four (4) hours pay or work for that  \nday.  \n7.7 Pay When Injured on Job. An employee who is unable to complete a scheduled workday due  \nto injury on the job shall be paid for all hours for which such employee was scheduled to work on the  \nday such injury occurs, including premium pay, if any.

If the work schedule has to be reduced, the following procedures  \nwill apply: |  \n   \nA. Hours will be reduced for remaining employees, but not below thirty-two (32) hours per  \nweek.  \nB. If further action needs to be taken, remaining employees will be laid off by  \nclassification, in accordance with their qualifications and seniority in the work area that  \nthey have been assigned.  \nC. Recalls will be handled in reverse order of layoff.  \n7.12 Temporary Transfers, All employees temporarily assigned to work in a higher rated job  \nclassification shall begin the wage progression for such classification after working for fifteen (15)  \ndays within any twelve consecutive month period in such classification. An employee is returned to  \nthe wage rate for the lower rated job classification upon returning to that classification, The  \nCOMPANY shall not regularly assign employees to work in a higher rated job classification for the  \npurpose of avoiding the payment of wages for work performed in such classification.
