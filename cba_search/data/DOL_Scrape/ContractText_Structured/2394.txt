commencing at any time between the hours of 5:00 A.M. and 9:00 A.M. Monday through Friday.  
At the COMPANY’s sole discretion, the COMPANY may offer a 4X10 work week schedule for  
service technicians commencing at any time between the hours of 5:00 A.M. and 7:00 A.M. Tuesday  
through Friday. A 4X10 work schedule will only be offered during the period when U.S. Day Light  
‘Savings Time is in effect. This work schedule will be on a volunteer basis. If the volunteers exceed the  
positions available, the most senior volunteers will be selected for the available positions, An  
employee’s selection for a 4X10 work week schedule will be for one Day Light Savings Time  
“season” and a new 4X10 work schedule will be offered in accordance with the procedure set forth  
above in each succeeding year during the term of the Agreement. When not on U.S. Day Light  
Savings Time and the COMPANY implements a reduced hour schedule, those technicians who worked  
4X10 work schedules during U.S. Day Light Savings Time will be scheduled off when and if their turn  
in the mandatory day off rotation. schedule established by the COMPANY falls on a Monday,  
otherwise, their position in the mandatory day off rotation will be skipped.

7.2 Service Technician Alternate Start Time  
   
Although it is and remains the UNIONS position, which the COMPANY disagrees with, that the shift  
premium language (Article 6.6) and the shift work language (Article 7.1) refers specifically to a shift  
which would follow the first shift (2" shift) and the language regarding starting times in Article 7.1  
refers to starting time of the first shift, in the spirit of cooperation and because we currently have a  
couple of employees interested, the UNION will agree to allow the employer fo initiate a overlapping  
or alternate Serviceman shift that would commence at 10:00AM Monday through Friday on a  
voluntary basis to enable the employer to better serve customers.  
The rate of pay for employees on the 10:00AM schedule shall receive $1.00 per hour in addition to  
their regular rate of pay for all hours worked on the alternate shift. All other portions of the collective  
bargaining agreement shall apply and be in full force and effect, except as specifically noted in this  
section, which is not precedent setting with respect to the subject of shift work.  
7.3. Lunch Period. Employees who are required to work 7 % hours or more are required to take  
one (1) thirty (30) minute unpaid lunch period. This lunch period shall begin at least 2 % hours after  
the start of the shift and no later than 6 1/2 hours after the start of the shift.  
7.4 Reasonable Overtime Requirement. Employees are required to work reasonable overtime.  
Reasonable is defined as 60% of the available overtime offered during a fiscal calendar quarter. An  
employee that works less than reasonable overtime for two quarter's in a year can be subject to  
disciplinary action. Notice of overtime is to be posted by the normal quitting time the prior day.  
Employees must notify the COMPANY at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance when declining  
overtime when the COMPANY has provided at least one (1) week’s notice that overtime is available.  
7.5 Reduction in Work Schedule - Notice. When the COMPANY changes a work schedule to  
less than eight (8) hours, it shall give notice thereof to affected employees by quitting time of the prior  
workday; otherwise, such employees shall be paid for eight (8) hours for the day involved.

COMPANY or its authorized representative and not put to work for any reason except weather  
conditions, fire, accident or other unavoidable causes, shall receive four (4) hours pay or work for that  
day.  
7.7 Pay When Injured on Job. An employee who is unable to complete a scheduled workday due  
to injury on the job shall be paid for all hours for which such employee was scheduled to work on the  
day such injury occurs, including premium pay, if any. In the event an employee is injured in the  
course of employment, he shall not be dismissed from such employment for a period of one (1) year  
because of his injury, unless there is no bargaining work available in his classification which he is  
capable of performing, or unless his dismissal is due to conditions beyond the control of the  
COMPANY.

probationary employee's qualifications and ability and shall be the sole and exclusive judge in deciding  
whether to continue such an employee's employment.  
7.10 Regular Layoffs, In the case where the qualifications of employees subject to layoff within a  
classification and level are relatively equal, seniority shall prevail.  
This requirement does not affect the COMPANY'S right to reduce hours according to Article VII,  
Section 7.11.  
7.41 Reduced Work Schedule. If the work schedule has to be reduced, the following procedures  
will apply: |  
   
A. Hours will be reduced for remaining employees, but not below thirty-two (32) hours per  
week.  
B. If further action needs to be taken, remaining employees will be laid off by  
classification, in accordance with their qualifications and seniority in the work area that  
they have been assigned.  
C. Recalls will be handled in reverse order of layoff.  
7.12 Temporary Transfers, All employees temporarily assigned to work in a higher rated job  
classification shall begin the wage progression for such classification after working for fifteen (15)  
days within any twelve consecutive month period in such classification. An employee is returned to  
the wage rate for the lower rated job classification upon returning to that classification, The  
COMPANY shall not regularly assign employees to work in a higher rated job classification for the  
purpose of avoiding the payment of wages for work performed in such classification. An employee  
temporarily assigned to work in a lower rated job classification shall continue to be paid the wage rate  
for the classification to which such employee is regularly paid.
