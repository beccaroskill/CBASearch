CLEANER/SWEEPER Classification:  
(a) Before Article VI regarding the cleanup rate will apply, prior

authority to allow use of the cleanup rate.  
(b) This would apply only to a Laborer or Laborers that are assigned

masonry and heavy concrete cleanup is completed.  
(d) Cleanup for the purpose of this provision is defined as the  
removal and joading of all crates, boxes, and packaging waste ma-  
terial; washing and cleaning of all walls, partitions, ceilings, windows,  
bathrooms, kitchens and all fixtures and facilities therein; sweeping,

### ARTICLE Vil  
### Furniture Laborer  
###

who are assigned the unloading of furniture to the point of installation,

### ARTICLE Vill  
### Laborer  
### 
1. An inexperienced Laborer is defined as an individual who has  
worked fewer than 1,200 hours under this Agreement or any other  
Agreement covering building and heavy construction work negotiated  
by a constituent local of the Laborers’ International Union of North  
America.  
2. An Laborer's Gross Wage is seventy-five percent  
(75%) of the Construction Laborer’s Gross Wage. An Inexperienced  
Laborer's Gross Wage shall be allocated so that 100% of the Constr-  
uction Laborer’s fringe benefit contributions are paid with the  
remainder of the Inexperienced Laborer's Gross Wage paid as the  
Base Wage.  
3. Before a Laborer is paid the Inexperienced Laborer scale of  
wages, the Employer must notify the Union in writing or by facsimile.  
The notice shall contain the person's name and Social Security  
Number and the project location. Within seventy-two (72) hours (ex-  
cluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of receipt of this notice, the  
Union must provide the Employer with a letter stating the number of  
42  
hours the individual has worked to date as a Laborer in building and  
heavy construction. The Employer may employ an Inexperienced  
Laborer immediately upon notice to the Union.  
4. tn calculating the number of hours worked in building and heavy  
construction, an Inexperienced Laborer shall be credited two (2) hours  
of jobsite work for every hour of instruction received from the  
Michigan Laborers’ Training Fund.  
5. Inexperienced Laborers shall not constitute more than twenty-five  
percent (25%) of the Laborers employed by the Employer on the job.  
To determine the number of Laborers employed, all classifications of  
Laborers except nonworking foremen and Cleaner/Sweeper Laborers  
shall be counted. To illustrate, after the Employer is employing three  
Laborers on the job, the fourth person may be an Inexperienced  
Laborer. After three additional Laborers (the 5th, 6th and 7th  
Laborers) are employed, the next Laborer may be another  
Inexperienced Laborer. Cleaner/Sweeper Laborers and nonworking  
foremen cannot be included when counting the number of Laborers  
employed by the Employer on the job. Upon request from the  
Employer, the Business Manager has discretion to permit the  
employment of Inexperienced Laborers in excess of 25% of the  
Laborers employed by the Employer on the job.  
6. An alleged violation of any part of this Article shall be submitted to  
the Labor Relationship Committee. If the Committee finds that an  
Employer has violated this Article, such as by failing to notify the  
Union in writing before paying the Inexperienced Laborer scale of  
wages, paying the Inexperienced Laborer an incorrect wage or by  
employing Inexperienced Laborers in excess of the maximum ratio  
allowed, the Committee may deny the Employer the privilege of using  
the Inexperienced Laborer scale of wages for up to one (1) year.

Employees working within the jurisdiction of the Union. The Employer  
appoints the Trustees of the LABORERS’ VACATION AND HOLIDAY

assignment of working dues, the Fund will, upon written request, remit  
to the Employee at regular intervals at such times as determined by  
the Trustees of the Fund, such a sum as would be remitted to the  
Union if such an authorization had been executed by the Employee.  
3. The authorization for the assignment of working dues shall be  
irrevocable for the period of one (1) year, or until the termination of  
this Collective Bargaining Agreement, whichever period is less, unless  
written notice is given by the Employee to the Trustees of the Fund  
and not more than sixty (60) days before any periodic renewal date.  
4. The Union shall indemnify and save each Employer, the Asso-  
ciation, and the Trustees harmless against any duplication of payment  
and any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that  
may arise out of or by reason of action taken by or not taken by the  
Employer, the Association or Trustees for the purpose of complying  
with this Article, provided, however, the Union shail not be responsible  
for any liability caused by the gross negligence or intentional  
misconduct of the Employer, the Association or Trustees.  
5. The Union agrees to bear all administrative costs involved in the  
deduction of the working dues from the Vacation and Holiday Fund  
and that there will be no cost to the Fund.

to obtain the signed authorizations of assignment, but that the Union  
shall be responsible for obtaining the authorizations from the  
Employees.
