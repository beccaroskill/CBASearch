PREAMBLE  
Pursuant to and in consolidation of the terms agreed to in the Memorandum  
of Agreement executed on May 25, 2004, this consolidated Contract is  
signed on this 3rd day of June, 2004, between PACIFIC BELL/NEVADA  
BELL, SBC Telecom, Inc. in Las Vegas, Nevada, SBC Telecom, Inc. —  
Network Operations, SBC Advanced Solutions, Inc., SBC Services, Inc.,  
Pacific Bell Information Services Maintenance Notification Group, and  
Pacific Bell Home Entertainment, hereinafter collectively referred to as the  
“Companies,” and the COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA,  
hereinafter referred to as the “Union.”  
The respective parties to this consolidated Contract do mutually agree and  
covenant as follows:  

### ARTICLE 1  
### RECOGNITION  
### 
Section 1.01 The Companies recognize the Union as the exclusive  
collective bargaining representative for those employees having the occu-  
pational title classifications outlined in Appendices A and B for the  
collective bargaining units described in the Agreement of Recognition.  
Section 1.02 Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing the inclu-  
sion of any employee or employees not properly includable in the above  
described bargaining unit, nor shall be construed as a waiver or forbearance  
on the part of the Union of any right to represent any employee or employ-  
ees properly includable in such bargaining unit as contemplated under the  
National Labor Relations Act as now or hereafter amended or superseded.  
Section 1.03 Additions to, or changes in, recognition as described in the  
Agreement of Recognition may be made by mutual agreement.  
Section 1.04 The Companies recognize the Union or its authorized  
representatives as having sole power to execute agreements with the Com-  
panies in regard to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other con-  
ditions of employment affecting the employees in the collective bargaining  
units described in the Agreement of Recognition.  
Section 1.05 The Companies will furnish a copy of the Contract to all  
employees.

NOTES  

### ARTICLE 2  
### FORCE ALLOCATION  
### Section 2.01 EMPLOYMENT SECURITY COMMITMENT  
### 
The Companies’ policy will be to offer all employees, who continue to meet  
performance standards, employment security through reassignment and  
retraining even if their present jobs are eliminated. This policy will be  
maintained so long as there is no change that will materially alter any of the  
Companies’ Business Plan achievement.  
Employees who utilize personal and/or career development programs  
designed to help them stay abreast of continuing technological and business  
changes, and who exercise flexibility in accepting new or changed work  
assignments and locations, will be assured employment security so long as  
there is no change that will materially alter any of the Companies’ Business  
Plan achievement.  
Section 2.02 EMPLOYEE CAREER DEVELOPMENT  
PROGRAMS  
The Employee Career Development Program, developed jointly by the  
Companies and the National Union, is designed to provide for the ongoing  
development of each employee’s capability throughout their careers with  
the Companies.  
A. The Program will be governed by the Vice President — Human  
Resources and the CWA Vice President, District 9, or their designated  
representatives, as well as three (3) representatives of the Companies  
and three (3) representatives of the Union. This Governance Board  
will oversee the activities of the Training/Retraining Working  
Committees.  
B. The Companies will provide specific, relevant and timely information  
regarding existing job opportunities to the Union. This information  
will be based on semi-annual force forecasts of future force reductions  
and job growth areas created by, but not limited to, major technolog-  
ical changes and consolidations. This information will be communi-  
cated to the appropriate Union and management representatives so that  
these representatives can help employees make decisions about their  
individual career paths.  
   
The purpose of the Employee Career Development Program is to:  
1. Educate employees about the necessity for, and reality of, change.  
2. Enable an employee to assess personal knowledge, skills, attrib-  
utes, behaviors and goals.  
3. Determine the knowledge, skills, attributes and behaviors for  
jobs and build a training and/or career path for each participating  
employee.  
4. Provide individual career and development counseling by trained  
counselors.  
5. Encourage employees to take control of their careers and seek out  
new career opportunities in sufficient time to take advantage of  
such opportunities.  
6. Emphasize each employee’s responsibility to seek out and take  
advantage of these and other career development tools and  
processes to better ensure their personal employment security.  
The Governance Board identified in Section 2.02A will be responsible  
for integrating and coordinating the activities of the Training/Retrain-  
ing Working Committees into the Employee Career Development  
Program.  
All Regular Full and Part-time employees with at least one (1) year of  
service will be eligible to participate in the Employee Career Devel-  
opment Program(s). Participation in the Program(s) shall be voluntary.  
Time spent by employees in Program activities will normally be out-  
side of scheduled working hours. Such time will not be paid and will  
not be considered as time worked for any purpose.  
Section 2.03 TRAINING/RETRAINING WORKING  
A.  
B.  
COMMITTEES  
The Training/Retraining Working Committees shall consist of equal  
numbers of Company and Union representatives.  
The functions of the Training/Retraining Working Committees are to:  
1. Develop programs which offer additional training opportunities  
to employees which will allow them to attain new skills and  
pursue different career paths.  
Propose those programs to the Governance Board for approval of  
appropriate expenditure of the Training/Retraining funding.  
Administer the programs and report on at least a quarterly basis  
to the Governance Board.  
C. The provisions of Sections 2.02 and 2.03 do not in any way affect the  
Companies’ right to implement the provisions of Article 2, Section  
2.05, Section 2.06 or Article 8.  
Section 2.04 THE AUTOMATED UPGRADE AND  
TRANSFER SYSTEM  
The Companies and the National Union agree that the Companies will  
replace the Upgrade and Transfer Plan with an automated transfer plan that  
shall provide placement opportunities for Regular employees. This Plan,  
called the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System (AUTS), will enable  
Regular employees to move to new job titles and work locations. Such  
moves not only benefit the Companies, but also benefit employees by  
allowing them to influence the direction of their individual careers.  
A. Regular Transfers  
iL.  
Participation in the AUTS shall require employees to verify, supply  
and update personnel data relative to work experience, testing,  
education and training. This information shall be the basis of  
each employee’s resume maintained in the AUTS database.  
Information regarding job openings will be made available to  
employees on an automated basis by the Companies. Such infor-  
mation will also be available to the Union Locals.  
Eligible qualified employees seeking placement can submit trans-  
fer requests for currently open positions and for future openings.  
Employees may have up to six (6) transfer requests at any one  
time. These may be upgrade, lateral or downgrade transfer  
requests and they may be for future or current vacancies. Each  
transfer request will designate a specific title and exchange (See  
Appendix C4).  
a. Employees will receive reports regarding the activity asso-  
ciated to their transfer requests every four (4) to six (6)  
weeks.  
   
A vacancy will be listed for a minimum of five (5) business days,  
during which time eligible employees may submit transfer  
requests for the position.  
The employee will have two (2) work days to accept or reject a  
job offer. Once a job offer has been made, all other transfer  
requests will be put on hold until the job offer has been accepted  
or declined.  
An employee’s transfer request will be maintained in the active  
file and/or considered for current open positions if the employee  
has met the prerequisites of satisfactory job performance, time-  
in-title and time-in-location (as indicated in Appendix C2), test-  
ing and other job requirements as determined by the Companies  
and indicated on the appropriate job brief.  
a. Least senior identified surplus employees (Section 2.06B 1)  
and employees placed under the provisions of Section 2.05  
(Force Balancing) and Section 2.06 (Force Movement) of  
this Article will not be required to meet time-in-title and  
time-in-location requirements in order to submit transfer  
requests following such identification and/or placement.  
b. employee refuses a job offer which matches a request,  
then that request will be cancelled; and it, or any other  
request that would include the same title and exchange, may  
not be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months from the  
date of refusal. When an employee accepts a job offer, all  
other transfer requests on file will be cancelled.  
c. Transfers submitted to AUTS for current positions expire  
thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a job match list or  
upon selection of a candidate for the vacancy, whichever  
occurs first. Transfers submitted for future positions will  
remain in file for six (6) months from the date of receipt, but  
will be cancelled upon the occurrence of any of the  
following:  
1. The employee no longer meets eligibility or qualifica-  
tions requirements.  
The employee withdraws the request.  
3. The employee leaves the Company payroll.  
4. The employee is no longer a Regular employee.  
d. Transfers will remain in file, but on inactive status, if any of  
the following are in excess of thirty (30) calendar days:  
leaves of absence; temporary promotions to management  
and disabilities.  
e. Eligible employees not test qualified for positions being  
sought through AUTS will be provided the opportunity to  
take such test(s) in the same order of consideration applica-  
ble to filling job vacancies under Section 2.04B1, subject to  
the availability of testing resources and the job vacancy rate  
for the positions being sought. Within each step in the  
sequence of search, employees will be tested in seniority  
order.  
B. Selection  
L.  
When the Companies declare a vacancy, the Companies may list  
on the requisition up to ten (10) skills taken from the job brief.  
These skills are in addition to the prerequisites described in  
Section 2.04A6. Employees will be selected by the skills listed on  
the requisition. Skills are based on the employees’ work experi-  
ence, training and education and are listed in their resumes. The  
Companies may, at their discretion, interview employees on job  
match lists to confirm their skills. When two (2) or more employ-  
ees have equal skills related to the vacancy, seniority will deter-  
mine the choice. The normal sequence of search to fill a vacancy  
will be:  
a. Qualified employees in the Available Employee File  
consisting of personnel returning from medical disability,  
military, care of newborn children, care of immediate  
family, Union leaves of absence, qualified medically  
restricted employees and surplus employees;  
b. Laid off employees as referenced in Article 8;  
c. Employees requesting changes of job titles and/or locations;  
d. New hires.  
In applying the provisions of Sections 2.04B 1a through 2.04B Ic,  
Nevada employees will be considered for Nevada positions for  
which they are qualified before such opportunities are made  
7  
   
available to Pacific employees. Pacific employees will likewise  
receive consideration for Pacific positions before such opportu-  
nities are made available to Nevada employees.  
Employees and new hires in Section 2.04Blc through 2.04B1d  
may be considered concurrently. When two (2) or more individ-  
uals are equally qualified, seniority will determine the choice.  
Notwithstanding Sections 2.04B1 through 2.04B3, VP entities  
may reserve up to 50% of their vacancies by title for intra VP  
entity movement. Those vacancies identified for intra VP entity  
movement will be made available to qualified employees within  
the same VP entity before such opportunities are made available  
to employees from other VP entities. Intra VP entity selection will  
be determined by skills and seniority as described in Section  
2.04B1. A VP entity will not have more than 50% of its vacan-  
cies reserved on a title by title basis at any point in time during  
the life of this contract.  
The Companies reserve the right to refuse transfers and may  
initiate transfers as they deem necessary.  
C. Retreats  
D.  
1.  
A Regular employee who has accepted a new job assignment,  
which is an upgrade under this Section 2.04, may elect to retreat  
to the previous department within the first six (6) months after the  
date of transfer, except as specified in Section 2.05C and  
2.06B10. The employee will be reassigned to the previous job or  
a comparable job within the same headquarters as the previous  
job as a vacancy becomes available. If the Companies and the  
Union Local(s) agree, the affected employee may be offered  
a comparable job outside the headquarters.  
The receiving department may elect to retreat an employee within  
the first six (6) months after the date of transfer except as  
specified in Section 2.05C and 2.06B 10.  
For both employee and Company initiated retreats, the first six  
(6) months may be extended for formal classroom training,  
leaves of absence, or disability.  
Joint AUTS Review Committee  
1. The Companies and the National Union will establish a Joint  
AUTS Review Committee comprised of two (2) Union repre-  
sentatives and two (2) representatives of the Companies. The  
responsibilities of the Committee will include:  
a. Assisting the Companies in providing for an orderly and  
efficient transition to AUTS;  
b. Monitoring the ongoing operation of AUTS;  
c. Analyzing overall AUTS results;  
Addressing concerns raised as to the staffing of positions  
through AUTS.  
2. The Joint Review Committee will meet on a regular basis, but not  
less than once each quarter.  
3. The Joint Review Committee is not empowered to enter into  
agreements modifying the Contract, employees’ wages, benefits  
(or other forms of compensation), job titles or representation  
status.  
4. Agreements made by the Joint Review Committee will not prej-  
udice the position of either the Companies or the Union and will  
not be cited in any other proceeding. Such agreements will not be  
subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.  
   
5. Individual placement decisions made pursuant to the AUTS shall  
be subject to the grievance procedure. Issues not resolved in the  
grievance procedure may be presented to the Joint AUTS Review  
Committee for final and binding resolution. Neither the AUTS  
nor its administration shall be subject to arbitration.  
Mini-Transfers  
The mini-transfer procedure is completely separate from the process  
described in Section 2.04A. The mini-transfer process is administered  
by local management without the involvement of the Placement organ-  
ization. Local management will consider mini-transfer requests before  
issuing a requisition. Time-in-title and time-in-location is accrued for  
employees who change their shift, location or status due to a mini-  
transfer.  
1. Regular employees (except for Operator Services employees  
listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01A) may submit local requests  
to change their shifts (day, evening or night) within their title and  
9  
their building locations or other organizational units as  
determined by the Companies and the Union. If there are no  
written requests on file, the available qualified employees within  
the building or organizational unit as determined by the  
Companies and the Union will be offered the vacancy.  
Regular employees (including Operator Services employees  
listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01) may submit local requests  
to change their work locations within their same titles. Requests  
for change in work locations will be to different buildings, or to  
different organizational units within the same district.  
Regular employees (including Operator Services employees  
listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01) may submit local requests  
to change their status from full-time to part-time or from part-  
time to full-time. Requests for change in status will be within the  
employee’s title and their building locations or other organiza-  
tional units as determined by the Companies and the Union.  
When a vacancy occurs, the Companies will review requests  
from available qualified employees. Employees will be consid-  
ered in order of seniority. The normal sequence of search to fill  
a vacancy will be:  
a. Employees requesting change of shifts under Section  
2.04E1;  
b. Employees requesting change of locations under Section  
2.04E2;  
c. Employees requesting change of status under Section  
2.04E3;  
d. Requests will be honored within the same State before  
allowing for interstate movement.  
The qualifications and availability of employees for the purpose  
of administering this Section 2.04E will be determined by the  
Companies.  
Section 2.05 FORCE BALANCING  
Whenever any conditions, including economic or force conditions or tech-  
nological change (defined as changes in equipment or methods of opera-  
tions), are considered by the Companies to warrant relocation of existing  
10  
work and/or rearrangement of employees, Regular employees may be  
reassigned. Prior to such reassignment(s), management will inform the  
affected Union Local(s) of the proposed move(s). The parties will then  
discuss the need for such reassignment and may explore possible alterna-  
tives. If the parties do not agree, the Companies will administer the  
reassignment of Regular employees.  
If the reassignment of Regular employees is deemed necessary by the  
Companies, the following provisions will apply:  
A. Relocation of Existing Work  
iL.  
In applying the provisions of Section 2.05A, the affected work  
group will be considered to be an administrative work unit. An  
administrative work unit is defined as those employees who have  
the same title classification and who perform similar work, as  
determined by the Companies, and share a common overtime list  
and vacation schedule or, if not sharing both the same overtime  
list and vacation schedule, sharing either the same overtime list  
or vacation schedule, whichever list or schedule is smaller.  
When only a portion of the work performed within an adminis-  
trative work unit is to be relocated, employees will be offered the  
opportunity to follow the relocated work based on net credited  
service as shown by the records of the Companies.  
If the amount of work to be relocated equates to less than one (1)  
full employee’s work, the Companies, at their discretion, may  
allow an employee to follow that portion of relocated work.  
If the relocation of existing work involves a move for an  
employee which is considered commutable, the employee will  
follow the work to the new location. Commutable employees  
who refuse reassignment under the provisions of this Section  
and least senior commutable employees who refuse reassign-  
ment under Section 2.05B will be considered to have voluntarily  
resigned and will not be entitled to Separation Benefits.  
If the relocation of existing work is to a non-commutable  
location, the employee may elect to either follow the relocated  
work or be identified as surplus. In the latter case, the employee  
will be administered according to the provisions of Article 2,  
Section 2.06.  
14  
   
B. Force Rearrangements  
1.  
In an attempt to avoid the declaration of surplus, or to balance the  
force, the Companies may rearrange employees in the same title,  
consolidated headquarters (Section 2.09B) and Presidential  
entity. The Companies will determine the appropriate work  
group(s) within the title, consolidated headquarters and Presi-  
dential entity for administration of the force rearrangement(s).  
There is no requirement to use any of the force rearrangement  
procedures prior to declaring a surplus.  
Prior to a force rearrangement, the Companies will inform the  
affected Union Local(s) of the proposed move(s). Those Union  
Local(s) and the Companies will discuss the need for the force  
rearrangement(s), possible alternatives and whether any “addi-  
tional vacancies,” as described in Section 2.05B4, will be offered.  
The Union Local(s) and the Companies will meet and discuss  
these issues in a timely manner. If there is no agreement between  
the Union Local(s) and the Companies, the Companies will  
administer the force rearrangement(s).  
The least senior qualified surplus employees in the affected work  
group (“affected employees’’) will be offered the available jobs  
in their same title, consolidated headquarters and Presidential  
entity. By seniority, the affected employees may elect to take  
such vacancies or replace the least senior employee with the  
same title within the same consolidated headquarters and within  
the same VP entity who is outside the affected work group. This  
process will continue until all available vacancies in the title,  
consolidated headquarters and Presidential entity are filled.  
a. If the most senior of the affected employee(s) elects not to  
replace the least senior employee in the title, consolidated  
headquarters and VP entity, then the most senior of the  
affected employee(s) will be assigned to a vacancy.  
b. If the most senior of the affected employee(s) elects to  
replace the least senior employee in the title, consolidated  
headquarters and VP entity, then the replaced employee will  
be held out of the process until all the affected employee(s)  
who have more seniority than the replaced employee(s)  
have the opportunity to either replace the remaining least  
senior employee(s) in the title, consolidated headquarters  
12  
and VP entity or be assigned to a vacancy. If there are no  
remaining affected employees with more seniority than a  
replaced employee(s), the replaced employee(s) will be  
assigned to a vacancy, if available.  
If the Companies and the affected Union Local(s) agree during  
their advance discussions, the affected employees may also be  
offered any or all of the following types of available jobs in their  
Presidential entity (‘additional vacancies’’):  
¢ same title which are outside the consolidated headquarters;  
* same wage schedule within the consolidated headquarters;  
¢ and same wage schedule which are outside the consolidated  
headquarters.  
If any such additional vacancies are made available to the  
affected employees, the same process described in Sections  
2.05B3, 2.05B3a and 2.05B3b will be followed. That is, by sen-  
iority, the affected employees may elect to take an offered  
vacancy, including an additional vacancy, or replace the least  
senior employee with the same title within the same consoli-  
dated headquarters and within the same VP entity who is outside  
the work group. This process will continue until all offered  
vacancies, including additional vacancies, are filled.  
Employees who choose not to accept a commutable assignment  
will leave the service of the Companies. Employees who choose  
not to accept a non-commutable assignment will leave the service  
of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits.  
Employees who accept a non-commutable assignment under  
Section 2.05B will be entitled to relocation expense reimburse-  
ment. Such employees will also be entitled to submit unlimited  
requests through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System for  
six (6) months from the effective date of their assignment. If an  
employee had the option of accepting a commutable job (other  
than replacing the least senior employee with the same title  
within the same consolidated headquarters and VP entity), but  
elected a non-commutable job, the employee will not receive  
relocation expense reimbursement and will not be eligible to  
submit unlimited requests through the Automated Upgrade and  
Transfer System for the six (6)-month period.  
13  
   
7. The Companies will inform the affected Union Local(s) of the  
results of a force rearrangement no later than thirty (30) calendar  
days after the effective date. The results will include the effective  
date of the force rearrangement, involved work locations and the  
name, title and net credited service (NCS) date of each involved  
employee.  
Employees reassigned under the provisions of Section 2.05 will have  
Limited Return Rights for up to 24 months from the effective  
date of their assignment. Limited Return Rights are to the  
employee’s former title, exchange and VP entity.  
As used in this Section 2.05 and Section 2.06, the term “qualified”  
refers to employees who have met the basic requirements of the job,  
including all tests, requirements and physical classifications as stated  
in the Jobs Handbook.  
Section 2.06 FORCE MOVEMENT  
A.  
Prior to a declaration of surplus, the Companies will implement any  
or all of the following steps:  
1. Maintain overtime at a minimum level within the surplus work  
group.  
2. Terminate Temporary, Term and Occasional employees, if appro-  
priate, where the Companies determine that surplus employees  
are qualified to perform the work.  
3. Stop hiring in the surplus title within the surplus work group.  
Force Movement Process  
1. The Presidential entity (or if there is no Presidential entity, the  
highest level entity below Presidential entity) will notify the  
affected Union Local(s) and the Executive Director-Labor Rela-  
tions fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the surplus declaration  
date. The Presidential entity (or if there is no Presidential  
entity, the highest level entity below Presidential entity) will  
notify the surplus work group ten (10) calendar days prior to  
the surplus declaration date. If the Union Local(s) so choose,  
they may join in the roll-out scheduled by the Companies to  
notify the surplus work group. Labor Relations will notify the  
National Union in writing of a declaration of surplus.  
14  
a. Awork group is defined as one containing Regular employ-  
ees with the same job title in a specific consolidated head-  
quarters (see Section 2.09B) within a Company Presidential  
entity. In Company organizations without a Presidential  
level of management, a work group will consist of Regular  
employees with the same job title in a specific consolidated  
headquarters within the highest level entity below  
Presidential level.  
b. Surplus employees are the least senior employees in a  
surplus work group.  
Liaison Committees comprised of Company and Union repre-  
sentatives will be established (one (1) for Northern California and  
Nevada and one (1) for Southern California) to function in an  
oversight role regarding problems encountered during the place-  
ment of surplus employees. The membership of each Liaison  
Committee will be comprised of one (1) representative from  
CWA District 9, one (1) representative from the affected CWA  
Local(s) and one (1) each from Labor Relations, the affected  
Company department and the Placement organization. These  
committees are empowered to resolve any issues or problems  
regarding the placement of employees under the Force  
Movement process described in Sections 2.06B and 2.06C.  
a. The Liaison Committees are not empowered to enter into  
agreements modifying the Contract, with respect to  
employee’s wages, benefits (or other forms of compensa-  
tion), job titles or representation status.  
b. Agreements made by the Liaison Committees regarding the  
placement of surplus employees will not prejudice the posi-  
tion of either the Companies or the Union and will not be  
cited in any other proceeding. Such agreements will not be  
subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.  
c. Unresolved issues or problems regarding the placement of  
surplus employees will not delay or defer the Force Move-  
ment process. In the event the Liaison Committee is unable  
to resolve a problem within thirty (30) days, the issue(s)  
may then be addressed under the grievance and arbitration  
provisions of this Contract. To ensure timely resolution of  
grievances regarding the placement of surplus employees,  
15  
   
such grievances will bypass Step I and Step II of the griev-  
ance process and be forwarded to the National Union Rep-  
resentative and Labor Relations Director with a summary of  
facts and the positions of each party prepared by the  
appropriate Liaison Committee.  
d. The Liaison Committees will discuss temporary and term  
positions that would be appropriate for consideration for  
surplus work groups. These committees are empowered to  
implement placement options in the appropriate Company  
organizations in an effort to relieve the surplus.  
e. The Liaison Committees will discuss positions that are  
being made available for new hires that would be appro-  
priate for consideration for surplus work groups. These  
committees are empowered to implement placement  
options regarding these positions in the appropriate  
Company organizations in an effort to relieve the  
surplus.  
When a work group is notified of a surplus declaration, the Com-  
panies will offer Separation Benefits, as described in Section  
2.07, the Special Leave of Absence and the Transition Leave of  
Absence to employees within the surplus work group, within the  
first ten (10) calendar days of the notice period. Employees may  
elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separa-  
tion Benefits or one (1) of the above referenced leaves to the  
extent necessary to relieve the surplus.  
Declaration of surplus shall not be made more frequently than  
once every three (3) calendar months for each specific work  
group.  
Once surplus has been declared to the Union, all activities under  
Section 2.05B will cease for the surplus work group(s).  
All Regular employees within a surplus work group will be given  
priority consideration for all available lateral (same wage sched-  
ule) and downgrade jobs, except jobs that are represented by  
other unions, beginning on the surplus declaration date (see Sec-  
tion 2.06B1). However, surplus employees represented by CWA  
will not be offered jobs in the non-represented unit if a declared  
surplus condition exists in that non-represented unit and will not  
16  
be given priority consideration for those jobs if a surplus condi-  
tion exists in another bargaining unit.  
a.  
All Regular employees in the surplus work group who wish  
to volunteer for the available lateral and downgrade jobs  
may submit unlimited requests for current and future jobs  
through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System begin-  
ning on the surplus declaration date.  
Qualified employees who have submitted transfer requests  
pursuant to Section 2.06B6 will be matched to jobs by  
seniority.  
Employees will have two (2) work days to accept or decline  
a job offer. Employees in a surplus work group who choose  
not to accept an offer for a position for which they had sub-  
mitted in accordance with Section 2.06B6 will leave the  
service of the Companies.  
Employees who accept jobs outside the CWA bargaining  
unit will assume the representation status of those jobs.  
The Placement Areas for employees covered by this  
Contract are:  
1. For California employees:  
Bay Los Angeles  
North Coast Orange/Riverside  
Sacramento/North San Diego/Imperial  
Valley Central Coast  
2. For Nevada employees:  
The State of Nevada  
The Rearrangement Areas for employees covered by this  
Contract are:  
1. Southern California from the Tehachapi mountains to  
the Mexican Border for employees working in  
Southern California.  
2. Northern California from the Tehachapi mountains to  
the Oregon border for employees working in Northern  
California.  
3. Nevada for employees working in Nevada.  
17  
   
If the procedures described in Sections 2.06B3 through 2.06B6  
have not resolved a declared surplus at the conclusion of thirty  
(30) calendar days including the date of the declaration, the  
remaining least senior identified surplus employees in the work  
group will be offered the Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option  
(VSRO) as described in Section 2.07K. Employees may elect the  
VSRO or elect to be assigned to available Regular full-time posi-  
tions (i.e., lateral, downgrade, commutable, non-commutable)  
within the CWA bargaining unit. Regular employees in the sur-  
plus work group may also continue to volunteer for lateral and  
downgrade positions as described in Section 2.06B6a until the  
Companies determine that the surplus is resolved in their work  
group.  
a. The Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO) includes  
Separation Benefits as described in Section 2.07, an addi-  
tional $3,000 and eighteen (18) months unlimited access to  
AUTS with selection status the same as that of employees  
requesting changes of job titles and/or locations (see Section  
  
b. Least senior identified surplus employees will have five (5)  
calendar days within which to make their election between  
VSRO or assignment.  
c. Qualified least senior identified surplus employees who  
decline VSRO or who do not make any election within the  
five (5) calendar days will be assigned to available positions.  
d. The order of selection will be:  
1. by seniority, qualified volunteers in the surplus work  
group;  
2. qualified least senior identified surplus employees who  
remain surplus after the thirty (30) day voluntary  
phase described in Section 2.06B6.  
e. Qualified least senior identified surplus employees will be  
assigned in the following order:  
¢ lateral jobs within the Placement Area by seniority;  
¢ downgrade jobs within the Placement Area by seniority;  
¢ lateral jobs within the Rearrangement Area by inverse  
seniority;  
18  
¢ downgrade jobs within the Rearrangement Area by  
inverse seniority;  
¢ lateral jobs within California for employees of the  
Companies in California by inverse seniority;  
¢ downgrade jobs within California for employees of the  
Companies in California by inverse seniority.  
If the Companies deem appropriate, certain qualifications  
may be waived under the provisions of this Section 2.06B7.  
Employees who choose not to accept an offer for a job  
which is a commutable lateral position will leave the service  
of the Companies. Employees who choose not to accept an  
offer for a job which is a downgrade and/or non-com-  
mutable position will leave the service of the Companies  
and receive Separation Benefits and eighteen (18) months  
unlimited access to AUTS with selection status the same as  
that of employees requesting changes of job titles and/or  
locations (see Section 2.04B 1c).  
Those employees placed through the force movement process  
will have Return Rights for up to twenty-four (24) months from  
the effective date of their assignment.  
a.  
Those employees with Return Rights will have up to  
twenty-four (24) months unlimited access to AUTS for any  
regular position.  
Those employees with Return Rights will have concurrent  
consideration with candidates described in Sections 2.04B1c  
and 2.04B1d and priority selection status if equally qualified  
with the most qualified candidate of those described in  
Sections 2.04Blc and 2.04B 1d.  
Return Rights will cease when an employee is placed in a  
position through AUTS prior to the expiration of the  
twenty-four (24) month period.  
Notwithstanding any other provisions in the contract,  
employees with Return Rights who accept positions through  
AUTS will not be entitled to Relocation Expense  
reimbursement.  
19  
   
10.  
11.  
Employees who accept downgrade positions under Section 2.06  
will be entitled to Reassignment Pay Protection Plan Benefits as  
described below:  
LESS THAN 15 YEARS OF NET CREDIT SERVICE  
WEEKS WAGE REDUCTION  
1 through 52 None  
53 through 57 1/3  
58 through 62 2/3  
63 & thereafter Full  
15 OR MORE YEARS OF NET CREDITED SERVICE  
WEEKS WAGE REDUCTION  
1 through 160 None  
161 through 164 1/3  
165 through 168 2/3  
169 & thereafter Full  
There are no retreat rights for employees placed into available  
jobs under the provisions of Section 2.06. However, employees  
who fail formal training after such placement will be returned to  
their former organizations, will be placed back into the force  
movement process and will be assigned to a Regular full-time  
(lateral/downgrade) position as described in Section 2.06B7.  
The Companies may engage in selective hiring during the Force  
Movement Process.  
If no Regular jobs are available, the remaining surplus employees  
will be offered the opportunity to either replace certain commutable  
contract labor if appropriate, or to leave the service of the Companies  
and receive Separation Benefits. Surplus employees who fail to make  
a choice relative to available contract jobs will leave the service of the  
Companies and receive Separation Benefits.  
1.  
Qualified employees who replace contract labor will be entitled  
to Reassignment Pay Protection Plan Benefits as described in  
Section 2.06B9. For purposes of determining the appropriate  
wage reduction, the competitive wage rate (prevailing rate for the  
contract job minus the value of Company-paid benefits) will be  
considered the wage rate of the contract job. Assignments involv-  
ing the replacement of contract labor will be considered  
temporary until a Regular job is available.  
20  
a. Employees in temporary contract jobs will be automatically  
matched in order of seniority to Regular lateral or down-  
grade jobs as positions become available. Employees may  
express their preferences for reassignment by submitting  
transfer requests through the Automated Upgrade and  
Transfer System. They may designate any lateral or down-  
grade job titles as the job titles in which they wish to be  
placed should vacancies occur.  
b. Employees in temporary contract jobs who choose not to  
accept an offer of a Regular job will leave the service of the  
Companies.  
At any time during the force movement process, if the Companies  
determine that surplus has been resolved in a work group, the Com-  
panies may rearrange the force as described in Section 2.05B.  
In the event that no commutable contract jobs are offered to surplus  
employees, the remaining surplus will be maintained until such time  
as a Regular lateral or downgrade job may be offered, or until the  
Companies inform the National Union in writing of their intent to lay  
off Regular employees.  
1.  
Maintained surplus employees who choose not to accept a com-  
mutable lateral job offer will leave the service of the Companies.  
Maintained surplus employees who choose not to accept a down-  
grade or anon-commutable job offer will leave the service of the  
Companies and receive Separation Benefits.  
Maintained surplus employees may, at the Companies’ discretion,  
be placed into commutable part-time jobs, if such jobs are avail-  
able. Surplus employees who choose not to accept an offer of a  
commutable part-time job will leave the service of the  
Companies and receive Separation Benefits.  
Managers may be reassigned to the bargaining unit utilizing either of  
the following provisions:  
1.  
Management employees may be reassigned to the bargaining  
unit provided there are no significantly qualified employees (i.e.,  
employees who perform similar work, as determined by the  
Companies) with greater seniority available to fill the vacancy  
with a transfer request on file for the position to which the  
manager would be assigned.  
21  
   
An administrative addition may be created, whereby the man-  
agement employee may be reassigned to the work group.  
If a manager (who has been a manager for six (6) continuous  
months or more immediately prior to the reassignment) is reas-  
signed to the bargaining unit, surplus shall not be declared in that  
work group for six (6) months or until the force level is reduced  
to the level which existed in that work group prior to the reas-  
signment of the manager, whichever occurs first.  
Section 2.07 SEPARATION BENEFITS (For Pacific Bell  
Home Entertainment, see Appendix B,  
Section B2.01)  
A. If during the term of this agreement, the Companies notify the  
National Union in writing that a surplus condition exists for any reason  
that will necessitate the reassignment of Regular employees, and the  
Companies deem it appropriate, the Companies may offer Separation  
Benefits in such job titles and such work locations as the Companies  
determine to be appropriate. If the Companies elect to so offer, Regular  
employees may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the  
Companies and receive Separation Benefits subject to the following  
conditions:  
1.  
The Companies will determine the job titles and work locations  
in which the surplus exists, the number of employees in such  
titles and work locations who are considered to be surplus and the  
period during which the employee may, if he or she so elects,  
leave the service of the Companies. None of the determinations  
by the Companies nor any part of this Section 2.07 will be subject  
to arbitration.  
The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the  
Companies and receive Separation Benefits shall not exceed the  
number of employees determined by the Companies to be  
surplus.  
An employee’s election to leave the service of the Companies and  
receive Separation Benefits must be in writing and transmitted to  
the Companies within ten (10) calendar days including the date  
of the offer. The employee may designate on the election form  
that the election is to be effective and irrevocable immediately. If  
22  
the employee does not so designate, such election may not be  
revoked after the ten (10) calendar day period.  
If the Companies deem it appropriate, they may elect to offer Separa-  
tion Benefits to selected titles in a work group (see Section 2.06B 1a)  
as a force management tool. The Companies will notify the National  
Union in writing when any such offer is made. The Companies also  
will, in advance of making this offer to employees, discuss the matter  
with the affected Union Local(s). After this discussion, if the Compa-  
nies elect to so offer, Regular employees may elect, in order of  
seniority, to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation  
Benefits subject to the following conditions:  
1. The Companies will determine the job titles and the work loca-  
tions for which the offer is to be made, the number of employees  
who may accept the offer and the period during which the  
employees may, if they so elect, leave the service of the Compa-  
nies. None of the determinations of the Companies nor any part  
of this Section 2.07 will be subject to arbitration.  
2. The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the  
Companies and receive Separation Benefits shall not exceed the  
number of employees identified by the Companies on the date of  
the offer to be appropriate.  
3. Anemployee’s election to leave the service of the Companies and  
receive Separation Benefits must be in writing and transmitted to  
the Companies within ten (10) calendar days including the date  
of the offer. The employee may designate on the election form  
that the election is to be effective and irrevocable immediately. If  
the employee does not so designate, such election may not be  
revoked after the ten (10) calendar day period.  
Employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and  
receive Separation Benefits will receive payments based on the  
employee’s net credited service and basic weekly wage rate at the time  
of leaving the Companies as indicated below:  
23  
   
YEARS OF SERVICE SEPARATION PAYMENTS  
0 1 week of pay

18 39 weeks of pay  
19 41 weeks of pay  
20 43 weeks of pay  
21 45 weeks of pay  
ZZ, 47 weeks of pay  
23 49 weeks of pay  
24 51 weeks of pay  
25+ 53 weeks of pay  
D. Employees may select one of the following payment options for  
Separation Benefits:  
1. A single payment paid by the end of the month following the  
month in which the employee separates; or  
2. Asingle payment paid at the end of the first quarter of the year  
following separation; or  
3. A partial payment, in the amount determined by the employee,  
paid by the end of the month following the month in which the  
employee separates, with payment of the balance deferred until  
the end of the first quarter of the year following separation; or  
24  
4. Monthly payments beginning the month following the month in  
which the employee leaves the service of the Companies until all  
payments have been made.  
The years of net credited service will be prorated for any period during  
which an employee is employed on a part-time basis in the same man-  
ner as calculated in the Pacific Telesis Group Pension Plan.  
As used in this Section, “basic weekly wage rate (or its equivalent)”  
does not include differentials, overtime or any other extra payments.  
At the time of reemployment with the Companies, a recipient of the  
Separation Benefits must repay the entire unused portion of the pay-  
ment (the number of weeks of payment minus the number of weeks off  
the payroll). Repayment may be made in whole or by payroll deduc-  
tions in each payroll period. Deductions will be made at the rate of at  
least ten (10) percent per week of the employee’s basic weekly wage  
rate. The entire amount must be repaid within twelve (12) months of  
reemployment.  
In those cases where payment has been deferred and the employee has  
not received final payment at the time of reemployment, the employee  
will receive a single payment for the actual number of weeks off the  
payroll.  
In those cases where the recipient has elected, or is receiving, monthly  
payments of Separation Benefits, such payments will be suspended  
upon reemployment with the Companies.  
Employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and  
receive Separation Benefits will continue to receive six (6) months of  
continued Company paid medical, dental and vision coverage, begin-  
ning on the date of their separation, with eligibility for COBRA cov-  
erage beginning at the end of the continued Company paid coverage.  
Least senior identified surplus employees within a surplus work group  
that remain surplus after the thirty (30) day voluntary phase of the  
force movement process described in Section 2.06B6 will be offered  
and may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the Com-  
panies and receive the Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO)  
subject to the following conditions. VSRO includes:  
¢ Separation Benefits as described above in Section 2.07  
¢ $3,000 added to the Separation Benefits payment  
¢ Eighteen (18) months unlimited access to AUTS  
25  
   
1. The Companies will determine the period during which the  
employee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the  
Companies. None of the determinations by the Companies nor  
any part of this Section 2.07K will be subject to arbitration.  
2. The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the  
Companies and receive VSRO shall not exceed the number of  
employees determined by the Companies to be surplus.  
3. Anemployee’s election to leave the service of the Companies and  
receive VSRO must be in writing and transmitted to the Compa-  
nies within five (5) calendar days of the last day in the thirty (30)

tion may not be revoked after the five (5) calendar day period.  
4. The $3,000 will be added to and paid with Separation Benefits in  
the manner elected as a payment option under Section 2.07D.  
5. At the time of reemployment with the Companies, a recipient of  
VSRO must repay the entire unused portion of the payment (the  
number of weeks of payment minus the number of weeks off the  
payroll). The $3,000 will equate to four (4) weeks of pay and that  
four (4) weeks will be added to the number of weeks of Separa-  
tion Benefits for this purpose. Repayment may be made in whole  
or by payroll deductions as described in Section 2.07G.  
6. In those cases where payment has been deferred and the  
employee has not received final payment at the time of reem-  
ployment, the employee will receive a single payment for the  
actual number of weeks off the payroll calculated as described in  
Section 2.07K5 above.  
7. In those cases where the recipient has elected, or is receiving,  
monthly payments of VSRO (i.e., the $3,000 added to and paid  
with Separation Benefits), such payments will be suspended upon  
reemployment with the Companies.

with an employee-initiated transfer, any cost incurred by the returned  
employee will be borne by the employee.  
E. For the purposes of this Article, an assignment shall be considered  
non-commutable if the distance from the employee’s permanent resi-  
dence to the new work location is greater than that from the

ing and consistent with the Union’s status as exclusive bargaining repre-  
sentative of all employees covered by this Contract. Each party shall bring

when such meetings pertain to matters relating to employees repre-  
sented by the Communications Workers of America, subject to the

Section 3.03 TIME OFF FOR UNION ACTIVITIES  
A. GENERAL  
1.  
To the extent that the Companies determine that the requirements  
of the service permit, an employee who is an authorized repre-  
sentative of the Union and who is covered by this Contract will  
be given an excused absence without pay, or a leave of absence  
without pay, subject to the conditions stated hereafter. Such time  
off will generally not be granted in cases where an overtime or  
premium rate would have to be paid to the employee or employ-  
ees replacing the Union representatives. As used in this Article  
the terms “excused absence” and “leave of absence” are defined  
as follows:  
¢ EXCUSED ABSENCE — An unpaid absence not exceeding  
thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.  
¢ LEAVE OF ABSENCE - An unpaid absence of over thirty  
(30) consecutive calendar days covered by a written leave of  
absence.  
The period of excused absence shall be used solely for the pur-  
pose of enabling authorized representatives of the Union to carry  
on activities of the Union directly concerning its relations with  
the Companies in connection with employees of the Companies  
covered by this Contract, except that the period of absence may  
be used to attend, for short periods of time, national or regional  
conventions or meetings of the Union.  
36  
The period of leave of absence shall be used for the purpose of  
enabling authorized representatives of the Union to carry on  
activities of the Union concerning its relations with the Compa-  
nies in connection with employees of the Companies represented  
by the Union, within the States or portions of States served by the  
Companies, except that,  
a. the period of absence may be used to attend national or  
regional conventions or meetings of the Union, and  
b. the period of absence may be used by not more than  
seventy- five (75) employees at any one time in serving as  
officers or representatives of the Union outside the territory  
described in 3 above, and  
c. the period of absence may be used by not more than forty  
(40) employees at any one time to carry on activities of the  
Union concerning employees of other telephone companies  
represented by the Union or not represented by any Union,  
within the States or portions of States served by the Com-  
panies.  
A maximum of thirty (30) authorized representatives of the  
Union at any one time may use periods of excused time off or  
leave of absence for such other activities as may be agreed to by  
the Companies.  
Requests for leaves of absence for Union activities shall be made  
in writing by the appropriate Officer of the National Union direct-  
ing District 9 of the Union or the Union’s authorized representa-  
tive, specifying the reasons for such leaves.  
It is agreed that the Companies have the right to terminate a  
leave of absence at any time if it is used for purposes other than  
those specified in the written application.  
Requests for excused absence shall be made by the Union repre-  
sentatives authorized for such purpose in writing to the appro-  
priate Labor Relations Director, by the appropriate Officer of the  
National Union directing District 9 of the Union. Such requests  
may also be made by any of the three (3) principal Officers of a  
Local. The Secretary or Secretary-Treasurer of each Local shall  
furnish a list of such Local Officers to the appropriate Labor  
37  
   
10.  
Relations Director and shall furnish amendments to such lists as  
changes are made.  
The Union shall make all requests for excused absences or leaves  
of absence as far in advance as possible, ordinarily not less than  
forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the time the employee is to  
be off on excused absence and ordinarily not less than two (2)  
weeks in advance of the start of a leave of absence or renewal of  
same; the Companies shall act promptly on each request.  
No payment shall be made to an authorized Union representative  
for time spent in meetings with the Companies’ representatives  
while the Union representative is on an excused absence or leave  
of absence.  
No employee shall take time off for Union activities unless  
excused in advance by supervision.  
EXCUSED ABSENCES  
I,  
The total of all excused absences granted to an authorized Union  
representative in each calendar year shall not exceed ninety (90)  
scheduled working days, or the equivalent thereof, in full days  
and/or fractional days. However, not more than one hundred fifty  
(150) authorized representatives of the Union may be granted  
excused absences not to exceed one hundred fifty (150) sched-  
uled working days, or the equivalent thereof, in full days and/or  
fractional days.  
A single period of excused absence shall not exceed thirty (30)  
consecutive calendar days.  
Meeting with the Companies’ representatives during a period of  
excused absence shall not be considered as breaking a continu-  
ous period of absence.  
Excused absences under this Section will be considered as time-  
worked for purposes of FMLA eligibility.  
NOTE: The provisions of this Section 3.03B will not apply to an  
employee who accepts a Staff position with the  
Communications Workers of America (CWA).  
LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
1.  
A leave of absence will be required:  
38  
a. If acontinuous period of absence for Union activity exceeds  
thirty (30) consecutive calendar days.  
b. If an employee who is an authorized representative of the  
Union is to have time off for Union activities in excess of  
ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) scheduled working  
days computed as specified in Section 3.03B.  
c. As of April 1, 2001, if an employee, who is an authorized  
representative of the Union, accepts a Staff position with the  
Communications Workers of America.  
If a leave of absence is granted because an employee’s excused  
absences have exceeded ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150)  
days computed as specified in Section 3.03B, the leave of  
absence shall be for a period beginning with the first scheduled  
working day after the last day worked and shall be for a period  
of not less than thirty-one (31) days.  
If the leave of absence is granted because an employee accepts a  
Staff position with the CWA, other than for a short-term tempo-  
rary backfill, the leave of absence will be for a period beginning  
with the first scheduled working day after the effective date of the  
CWA employment and will not be for a period of less than thirty-  
one (31) calendar days. The employee must remain on the leave  
of absence until one of the following occurs:  
a. The employee’s Staff position with the CWA is concluded  
and the employee notifies the Companies, in accordance  
with Section 3.03D, of his/her intent to return to work within  
the time allowed under Section 3.03C7 of this agreement.  
b. The employee would exceed the Union Leave of Absence  
time allowed under Section 3.03C7 of this agreement, at  
which time the employee would notify the Companies, in  
accordance with 3.03D, of his/her intent to return to work or  
terminate his/her employment with the Companies.  
The general rules of the Companies governing leaves of absence  
for personal reasons shall apply except as changed herein.  
At no time shall more than one hundred (100) employees be on  
leave of absence under this Article.  
39  
   
10.  
A leave of absence for Union activities or an extension of sucha  
leave shall be for a period of not more than one (1) year each.  
The total cumulative period of leave-of-absence for Union busi-  
ness shall not exceed twenty-one (21) years, all of which shall be  
counted as service credit in terms of employment. The payment  
of premiums for continuation of standard fringe benefits during  
a leave of absence for Union business shall be as follows:  
Medical/Dental/Vision Companies pay  
Group Insurance Companies pay  
Pension Band Will be determined by the  
employee’s last title and wage  
area prior to the start of the most  
recent leave of absence for  
Union business updated to  
current comparable title and  
wage area.  
In computing an employee’s net credited service for all purposes  
except wage progression, full credit shall be allowed for periods  
of leaves of absence for Union activities not exceeding twenty-  
one (21) years in the aggregate during the employee’s total ser-  
vice life. No credit for any purpose shall be allowed for such  
leaves in excess of twenty-one (21) years, nor shall credit be  
allowed for wage progression purposes for any period covered by  
leaves of absence granted pursuant to Section 3.03.  
When the period of a leave of absence for Union activities is to  
be included in computing an employee’s net credited service,  
the employee shall retain eligibility, if any, according to term of  
service, to:  
a. Death Benefits, and  
b. Short-Term Disability Benefits.  
In determining such employee’s eligibility to sickness  
disability benefits, the first day following termination of the  
leave of absence shall be considered as the first day of  
absence because of sickness.  
A leave of absence granted under this Article shall automatically  
terminate if at any time the employee on leave engages in any  
40  
gainful occupation other than as a representative of the Union or  
if the employee ceases to function as an authorized representative  
of the Union.  
D. REINSTATEMENT OF EMPLOYEE UPON RETURN FROM  
ABSENCE  
1.  
Authorized Union representatives upon return from excused  
absences or leaves of absence shall be reinstated at work gener-  
ally similar to that which they were engaged last prior to their  
absence, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 2.04B la.  
Employees shall be placed on the payroll at the rate then in effect  
for their assignment and for the period of service which was  
credited to them for wage purposes at the start of their absence.  
After receipt of notice from an employee to the Companies stat-  
ing the desire to terminate an excused absence or leave of  
absence prior to the specified termination date, the leave will be  
terminated upon the employee’s return to work as instructed by  
the Companies. However, a leave shall be terminated at the  
request of the employee prior to its stated expiration date as pro-  
vided in this Paragraph only in case the employee is able on the  
day of return to perform, on a full-time basis, the duties required  
of such an employee.  
Section 3.04 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MEETINGS  
BETWEEN UNION AND MANAGEMENT  
REPRESENTATIVES  
A. The Companies will compensate up to four (4) authorized represen-  
tatives of the Union, who are active employees covered by this  
Contract, for attending meetings with Management for the purpose of  
negotiating a written Contract. This compensation will be at the  
employee’s basic straight time wage rate for scheduled workdays only  
and will not include any differential payments. The total days paid by  
the Companies for each employee will not exceed forty-five (45). The  
expenses of all Union representatives will be borne by the Union.  
Time spent in attending meetings with Management under this Section  
will not be considered time worked, except for the purpose of FMLA  
eligibility.

Section 3.05 UNION ACTIVITIES ON THE  
A.  
COMPANIES’ PREMISES  
Authorized representatives of the Union may be granted access to the  
Companies’ premises where employees covered by this Contract are  
located upon application to the appropriate Company supervisor at the  
location in question, subject to the Companies’ practices and the  
requirements of Government regulations.  
The Union or its members shall not carry on any type of Union activ-  
ities on the Companies’ premises, except as provided in Section 3.05C,  
unless advance approval has been given by appropriate Company  
supervision for such activities. The Companies reserve the right to cur-  
tail or prohibit any Union activity on any premises of the Companies  
when, in their judgment, such activity is not in accordance with the  
approval granted by appropriate Company supervision as provided in  
this Section 3.05B.  
Union activities involving the solicitation of members on the Compa-  
nies’ premises shall be carried on only in accordance with the  
following:  
1. Union representatives may solicit members among employees of  
the Companies in the Areas now represented by this Union.  
2. Such solicitation shall only be made during periods when neither  
the Union members nor the employees being solicited are on  
Company time, excluding paid rest and meal periods.  
3. Such solicitation shall not be carried on in space where the Com-  
panies’ operations or administrative work is being performed.  
4. Such solicitation shall be limited to small groups of employees  
(not to exceed four (4)).  
5. Such solicitation shall not interfere with the operations of the  
Companies or the use of the space for the purposes for which the  
space is intended.  
Authorized representatives of the Union may attend Union-Manage-  
ment meetings for the purposes of collective bargaining and discussing  
grievances presented to the Union by employees covered by this Con-  
tract when such meetings have been suitably arranged for in advance.  
42  
Section 3.06 BULLETIN BOARDS  
A.  
Upon written request from the Union, the Companies agree to install  
or to move bulletin boards for the exclusive use of the Union. Bulletin  
boards and their designations shall be provided by the Union and shall  
be in accordance with the Companies’ specifications. The size of the  
bulletin boards shall be approximately 18" x 36", 24" x 36" or  
12" x 24" in dimensions. The number and location of bulletin boards  
shall be determined jointly by the Companies and the Union with due  
regard to visibility and accessibility to employees for whom the Union  
is the recognized representative. Each bulletin board shall be  
designated specifically as follows:  
UNION BULLETIN BOARD  
Local (Number), Communications Workers of America  
Letters in such designation shall not be over 1-1/2" high. The overall  
size of the designation shall not extend beyond the bulletin board  
itself, or be more than 24" long by 2" high, and shall be in a horizontal  
position within 3" of the top of the bulletin board.  
Unless otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Companies, the  
Union agrees not to post or distribute Union material any place on the  
Companies’ premises other than on Union bulletin boards. Unless  
otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Companies, the Union also  
agrees that Union bulletin boards shall be used solely for notices and  
announcements concerning Union meetings, elections, appointments  
to office, social, educational, or recreational affairs and agreements  
concluded between the Union and the Companies. Posted notices and  
announcements shall be appropriately identified as Union material  
intended for posting and shall ordinarily bear the signature of an  
authorized representative of the Union. Should the Union desire to  
post subject matter other than the material specified above, it shall  
obtain advance approval from the Companies before such subject  
matter is posted.  
Material posted shall not contain anything controversial or anything  
derogatory to the Companies or any of their employees. The Union  
assumes responsibility for complete compliance with the provisions  
herein contained. Should the Union post material which, in the judg-  
ment of the Companies, is at variance with the spirit and intent of this  
43  
   
Section, such material shall be immediately removed by the Union  
upon notification by the Companies.  
If the Union violates any provision of Section 3.06B or Section 3.06C,  
the Companies, after giving due notice of such violation, may deny the  
right of the Union to use any or all bulletin boards on the Companies’  
premises, and may remove any or all such bulletin boards.  
Section 3.07 UNION SECURITY  
A.  
Each employee who is a member of the Union or who is obligated to  
tender to the Union amounts equal to periodic dues on the effective  
date of this Contract, or who later becomes a member, and all employ-  
ees entering into the bargaining unit on or after the effective date of  
this Contract shall, as a condition of employment, pay or tender to the  
Union amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable to members for  
the period from such effective date or, in the case of employees enter-  
ing into the bargaining unit after the effective date, on or after the  
thirtieth day after such entrance, whichever of these dates is later,  
until the termination of this Contract. For purpose of this Section,  
“employee” shall mean any person entering into the bargaining unit,  
except an Occasional employee.  
Each employee who is a member of the bargaining unit on or before  
the effective date of this Agreement and who on the effective date of  
this Agreement was not required as a condition of employment to pay  
or tender to the Union amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable  
to members shall, as a condition of employment, pay or tender to the  
Union amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable to members for  
the period beginning thirty (30) days after the effective date of this  
Agreement, until the termination of this Agreement.  
The condition of employment specified above shall not apply during  
periods of formal separation from the bargaining unit by any such  
employee but shall reapply to such employee on the thirtieth day  
following the employee’s return to the bargaining unit. The term  
“formal separation” includes transfers out of the bargaining unit,  
removal from the payroll of the Companies and leaves of absence of  
more than one month duration.  
The Companies may inform employees and applicants for employ-  
ment of their rights and obligations under the provisions of this  
Section.  
44  
This Section shall apply only in the State of California on the effec-  
tive date of this Contract. If during the term of this Contract the Union  
shall become duly authorized under the laws of the State of Nevada to  
enter into this type of union security agreement, the effective date of  
this Section as to employees in Nevada shall be the date upon which  
the Companies receive proper written evidence from the Union that it  
is fully qualified to enter into such an agreement in Nevada. Upon  
proper written notification that the Union is qualified to enter into a  
union security agreement, this entire Section will become applicable  
to employees in Nevada.  
Section 3.08 PAYROLL DEDUCTION OF UNION DUES  
A.  
The Companies agree that, upon receipt of an individual written  
request on a form approved by the Companies and signed by an  
employee covered by this Contract, they will deduct monthly from  
such employee’s wages the amount of Union dues specified in such  
request and forward the full amount thus deducted to the Secretary-  
Treasurer of the Union or the Union’s authorized agent as directed.  
1. For all employees of the Companies in California, the request  
may be revoked at any time upon the employee’s written request  
to the Company and such request should be directed to the Labor  
Relations Director, San Ramon, as appropriate. For employees of  
the Companies in Nevada who currently have executed dues  
deduction cards on file, the dues deduction request may be  
revoked at any time upon the employee’s written request to the  
Company and such request should be directed to the Labor Rela-  
tions Director, San Ramon. For employees of the Companies in  
Nevada who execute dues deduction cards as described in Sec-  
tion 3.08E after the effective date of this bargaining agreement,  
cancellation of payroll deduction authorizations will be made as  
specified in Section 3.08E.  
2. In general, dues deductions will be made in a designated pay-  
period in the current month for properly executed dues deduction  
authorizations received in the appropriate Accounting Center on  
or before the fifth day of the preceding month. However, the  
Companies assume no responsibility either to the employee or to  
the Union for any failure to make or for any errors made in  
45  
   
making such deductions, but will make such efforts as they deem  
appropriate in correcting any such errors or omissions.  
Authorizations for dues deductions shall be “open-ended” to provide  
for the deduction of dues in an amount which is certified to the Com-  
panies in writing by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union as being the  
regular monthly membership dues of the particular Local involved.  
The form of such individual authorization card shall be as approved by  
the Companies.  
The written certification changing the amount of dues to be deducted  
must be delivered to the Executive Director - Labor Relations on or  
before the fifth work day of the month preceding the month in which  
the first deduction at the new rate is to be made effective, together with  
a list of the work locations and Union Local affected by the change.  
The Companies agree to furnish the Union at the time of remitting the  
dues deducted, a list, on magnetic tape, of the names of those employ-  
ees represented by the Union and the amount of dues deducted. The  
content and form of other employee information to be furnished to the  
Union on magnetic tape shall be such as agreed upon by the parties  
from time to time.  
The following Section applies only to employees in Nevada. Autho-  
rizations for dues deductions executed pursuant to Article 3.08A after  
August 6, 1989 shall specify that dues deductions may be revoked  
only within the fourteen (14) day period immediately prior to each  
anniversary of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement or during  
the fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the termination date of the  
Collective Bargaining Agreement.  
Cancellations by employees of such written payroll deduction author-  
izations must be in writing and such cancellation requests must be sent  
individually by certified mail to the Labor Relations Director, San  
Ramon, postmarked or received during the fourteen (14) day period  
described in 3.08E. After receipt of such cancellation the Company  
will discontinue the payroll deduction in the month following that in  
which the cancellation is received and will notify the Union of the  
action taken.  
Cancellation of dues deduction authorizations will be made by the  
Companies on the permanent transfer or promotion of an employee to  
an ineligible position effective the first payroll period following the  
46  
transfer or promotion and the Companies will notify the Union of  
such cancellation.  
It is agreed that the payroll deduction of Union dues shall be in lieu of  
Union collection of dues, assessments and contributions on the  
Companies’ premises where work operations are being performed and  
while Union representatives and/or the employees involved are on  
Company time.  
The Union shall indemnify and hold the Companies harmless against  
any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that may  
arise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Compa-  
nies for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Article,  
or in reliance on any dues deduction card furnished under the  
provisions of this Article or on any certification by the Union.  
Section 3.09 NON-DISCRIMINATION  
A.  
In a desire to restate their respective policies, neither the Companies  
nor the Union shall unlawfully discriminate against any employee  
because of such employee’s race, color, religion, sex, age, marital sta-  
tus, sexual orientation, or national origin or because the person is dis-  
abled, a special disabled veteran, a disabled veteran or a veteran of the  
Vietnam era.  
The Companies and the Union recognize that potential conflicts may  
arise between obligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act  
(ADA) and the terms of the Contract. In order to minimize disputes  
between the Companies and the Union due to any such potential con-  
flicts and to ensure timely resolution, the parties agree that all issues  
regarding actions which the Companies believe to be consistent with  
the ADA and the Union believes to be in conflict with the Contract will  
be referred to and addressed by a National Union Representative, a  
representative from the affected Union Local, the Labor Relations  
Director (or authorized representative) and a representative from the  
affected Company department (“ADA Liaison  
1. The ADA Liaison Committee is empowered to resolve any issues  
or problems regarding a potential conflict between obligations  
under the ADA and the terms of this Contract.  
2. Agreements made by the ADA Liaison Committee will not prej-  
udice the position of either party and will not be cited in any other  
47  
   
proceeding. Such agreements will not be subject to the grievance  
and arbitration process.  
3. Unresolved issues or problems regarding potential conflicts will  
not delay or defer the Companies’ actions. If the ADA Liaison  
Committee is unable to resolve a dispute, the issue(s) regarding  
appropriate actions under the ADA and the Contract may then be  
addressed under the arbitration provisions of the Contract. To  
ensure timely resolution of such disputes, the grievance proce-  
dure shall be bypassed and the matter may be submitted directly  
to arbitration.  
C. It is mutually agreed that neither party shall interfere with, restrain,  
coerce, or otherwise discriminate against employees in their right to  
join or assist, or refrain from joining or assisting, any labor organiza-  
tion.  
D. The Companies shall not interfere with, restrain, coerce, intimidate or  
otherwise discriminate against any employee because of membership  
or lawful activity in forwarding the interests or purposes of the Union.  
Section 3.10 FEDERAL OR STATE LAWS  
In the event any Federal or State law or regulation or governmental order,  
or the final decision of any court or board of competent jurisdiction affects  
any one or more provisions of this Contract, the provision or provisions so  
affected shall be made to comply with the requirements of such law, regu-  
lation, governmental order, or decision for the localities within the juris-  
diction and otherwise the Contract shall continue in full force and effect.

### ARTICLE 4  
### JOB TITLES AND CLASSIFICATIONS  
### Section 4.01 NEW JOB TITLES AND JOB  
### 
A.  
CLASSIFICATIONS  
Whenever the Companies determine it appropriate to create a new job  
(1.e., a new title or use of a current job title for a new position being  
established in a fifth level organization or next lower level organiza-  
tion if no fifth level organization exists), in the bargaining unit, during  
the life of the contract, they shall proceed as follows:  
1.  
The Companies will notify the Union before an Occupational Job  
Evaluation (OJE) is conducted, including the reason for the OJE,  
the rationale behind the request, the number of incumbents (pro-  
posed) and work location(s) (proposed). Following such notice to  
the Union, the Companies may proceed to complete the OJE and  
establish a provisional job title and wage schedule.  
The Companies will notify the Union of the provisional job title  
and wage schedule that is established. Following such notice to  
the Union, the Companies may proceed to staff such job title at  
the determined wage schedule. The Companies will conduct a  
follow-up review to assess whether the provisional rating remains  
appropriate. The follow-up review will occur no less than six (6)  
months after staffing. After the Companies’ follow-up review is  
completed, the Union will be notified. Notification will include  
the specific justifications for the recommended title(s) and/or  
wage schedule(s).  
Whenever the Companies, during the life of the Contract, determine  
it appropriate to reclassify a job title or wage schedule because the job  
content of an existing job has changed due to new technology or func-  
tionalization they shall proceed as follows:  
1.  
The Companies will notify the Union before an Occupational Job  
Evaluation (OJE) is conducted, including the reason for the OJE,  
the rationale behind the request, the number of incumbents (exist-  
ing) and work location(s) (existing). Following such notice to the  
Union, the Companies may proceed to complete the OJE and  
reclassify the job title or wage schedule.  
49  
   
2. The Companies will notify the Union of any reclassification of  
the title or the wage schedule including the specific justifications  
used to make the determination leading to such reclassifica-  
tion(s). Following such notice to the Union, the Companies may  
proceed to staff such job title or classification. Wage Adminis-  
trative practices in Appendix C, Section(s) C8.02 and C8.04,  
respectively, will be applied for upgraded or lateral reclassifica-  
tions, however, step down from maximum referenced in  
C8.02C and D will not apply to upgrades. The Job Evaluation  
Transition Pay Plan (JETPP) Memorandum of Agreement will be  
applied for reclassifications resulting in a downgrade. Any title or  
wage schedule change will be effective with the next payroll  
period following notification to the Department.  
NOTE: No other reclassification of existing jobs will occur  
during the life of this Contract; rather any such reclassi-  
fications will normally be negotiated during bargaining.  
The Companies agree to meet with the Union upon the Union’s  
request to discuss any aspect of the job evaluation process which led  
to the Companies’ decision regarding the recommended title and/or  
wage schedule, including the rationale used by the Companies to  
arrive at the Companies’ recommended title and/or wage schedule.  
Within thirty (30) calendar days from the Union’s receipt of the Sec-  
tion 4.01B2 reclassification notice or no later than thirty (30) calendar  
days from the Union’s receipt of the Section follow-up notice,  
the Union shall have the right to initiate negotiations concerning the  
wage rates or schedules established or changed by the Companies.  
If negotiations are not so initiated within the thirty (30) calendar day  
periods described in Section 4.01D or if agreement is reached between  
the parties concerning the wage rates and schedules within sixty (60)  
calendar days following receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up  
notice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the wage rates and  
schedules set by the Companies or agreed to by the Parties, shall  
remain in effect.  
If negotiations are so initiated pursuant to Section 4.01D and if the par-  
ties are unable to reach agreement on the schedule of wage rates  
within sixty (60) calendar days following the Union’s receipt of the  
Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification  
notice, the Union must notify the Companies in writing of its intention  
50  
to submit the issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates to a Neu-  
tral Third Party for resolution, to be selected as set forth in Section  
4.01G.  
NOTE: The Union’s written notice shall specify the wage schedule  
the Union believes should be assigned to the job in question  
and the reasons why.  
If such notification is not received by the Companies within sixty (60)  
days of the Union’s receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice or  
the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the matter shall be consid-  
ered settled in the Companies’ favor and shall not be subject to further  
handling under this procedure, nor may the issue be submitted to the  
problem resolution, grievance and arbitration procedures.  
The Neutral Third Party previously referred to shall be selected by  
mutual agreement of the parties from a panel of six (6) arbitrators  
selected for their expertise in the field of job evaluation.  
The members of the panel may be changed by mutual agreement of the  
parties. Though the panel members will normally receive first con-  
sideration, the parties reserve the right to jointly select a Neutral Third  
Party outside of the panel to serve on an ad hoc basis.  
1. The Neutral Third Party will render a written decision within  
fifteen (15) working days after the hearing.  
2. The Neutral Third Party is empowered to decide only whether the  
wage schedule assigned by the Companies or the wage schedule  
requested by the Union is the appropriate wage schedule.  
3. The Neutral Third Party is not empowered to assign a wage  
schedule and title classification that is not currently contained in  
the collective bargaining agreement or to render a decision on any  
other issues.  
4. The Neutral Third Party shall have no authority to add to, subtract  
from, or modify any provisions of the collective bargaining  
agreement.  
The procedures set forth in Section 4.01 shall be the exclusive means  
by which the Union may dispute the schedule of wage rates which the  
Companies set for any new, restructured or redefined job title or clas-  
sification established by Section(s) 4.01A and B. Disputes regarding  
job classifications which are not governed by this Section 4.01 may be  
51  
   
pursued under the Problem Resolution Procedures set forth in  
Article 7.  
Section 4.02 ASSIGNING TITLES  
A.  
The assignment of particular titles to employees with titles listed in  
Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01, A3.01 and A4.01 and Appendix  
B, does not mean that they shall perform only the kind of work com-  
ing under their title classification, nor that certain kinds of work shall  
be performed exclusively by certain classifications of employees.  
Except as provided for in Appendix A, Sections A3.05B and C an  
employee assigned to work falling in a higher wage group (other than  
work incidental to the lower classification) shall, during the period the  
employee is assigned to work falling in a higher wage group, be  
assigned a title in the wage group in which the employee works a  
greater part of the normal workweek for a period of one week or  
more.  
Employees who are regularly assigned to work coming under more  
than one (1) title classification listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01  
and A2.01, or Appendix B, which carry identical wages and working  
conditions, shall be classified under the title which covers the work on  
which they are engaged for the greater part of the time.  
Section 4.03 PART-TIME, TERM, TEMPORARY AND  
A.  
OCCASIONAL EMPLOYEES  
PART-TIME EMPLOYEES  
A part-time employee is one who is employed and normally scheduled  
to work less hours per average month than a comparable full-time  
employee in the same job title, classification and work group working  
the same normal daily tour. Treatment of a part-time employee under  
the Companies’ benefit plans and payment programs is dependent on  
the employee’s “average workweek” and whether the employee is  
“grandfathered.”  
1. “GRANDFATHERED” PART-TIME EMPLOYEES  
a. Certain part-time employees shall be “grandfathered” as  
follows:  
1. Regular part-time employees who were on the active  
payroll of the Companies as of December 31, 1980  
52  
and who were classified as part-time on August 9, 1992  
shall be “grandfathered” so long as they continue to be  
classified as part-time; and  
2. Regular employees who were on the active payroll of  
the Companies as of December 31, 1980, who were  
classified as full-time on August 9, 1992, and who  
become classified as part-time as a result of surplus in  
which there are no Regular commutable full-time jobs  
available for which they are qualified, shall be “grand-  
fathered” so long as they continue to be classified as  
part-time, unless and until such time as they have been  
offered, and have rejected, the opportunity to be placed  
in a commutable Regular full-time job.  
“Grandfathered” employees shall, during the applicable  
term of part-time employment, receive payments under ben-  
efit plans and payment programs on the same basis as was  
applicable to part-time employees on December 31, 1980.  
ALL OTHER PART-TIME EMPLOYEES  
All part-time employees who are not “grandfathered” shall  
receive payments under the Companies’ benefit plans and  
payment programs as described in this section.  
a.  
Part-time employees who are not “grandfathered” include,  
but are not limited to:  
1. Employees who were on the active payroll of the Com-  
panies as of December 31, 1980 and who were not  
classified as part-time on August 9, 1992; and  
2. Regular part-time employees who were hired or  
rehired on or after January 1, 1981.  
When an employee begins working part-time the “average  
workweek” will be determined in advance by dividing the  
employee’s normally expected scheduled hours per month  
by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole  
number. (For example: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35  
equals 15.6, rounded to an average workweek of 16 hours).  
This “average workweek” will apply until an employee has  
worked a full calendar quarter as a part-time employee.  
93  
   
After an employee has worked a full calendar quarter as a  
part-time employee, the “average workweek” will be rede-  
termined as of the end of each calendar quarter during which  
the employee was classified as a part-time employee for the  
entire quarter. The “average workweek” for the following  
quarter will be determined by averaging all hours worked  
during the prior quarter. This average includes:  
(1) Hours worked up to a maximum of eight (8) per day or  
forty (40) per week; and  
(2) Hours scheduled or assigned to be worked but excused,  
paid or unpaid.  
(3) The total of (1) & (2) above will be limited to a maxi-  
mum of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) per week.  
For periods of service as a part-time employee after January  
1, 1993, proration calculations for wages or service for each  
of the following benefit plans and payment programs will be  
based on the relationship of the individual part-time  
employee’s “average workweek” to a forty (40) hour  
workweek:  
Pension Plan  
Comprehensive Disability Benefit Plan  
Life Insurance Plans  
Savings Plan  
Severance Plans  
Vacation, Holiday and Paid Personal Days Off  
Sickness Absence Payments  
Team Performance Award  
The revised calculation method will not apply retroactively,  
and employees receiving disability benefits under the Com-  
prehensive Disability Benefits Plan, sickness absence pay-  
ments, or vacation payments on January 1, 1993 will  
continue to receive the same level of benefits until their  
eligibility for such benefits or payments expires.  
Monthly contributions to the Medical, Dental and Vision  
Plans will be prorated using the same percentage calculated  
in Section 4.03A2b or 4.03A2c as applicable. The Compa-  
nies will pay that percent of the cost of coverage for  
54  
Medical, Dental and Vision care. The part-time employee  
will pay the difference between the Company contributions  
and the cost of the plan.  
3. A part-time employee shall not be paid Sickness Absence pay-  
ments under Section 5.01F unless such absence due to sickness  
occurs on a day of the week on which the employee is normally  
scheduled to work and a full-time employee in the same circum-  
stance would be paid.  
TERM EMPLOYEES:  
Term employees are those engaged for a specific project or limited  
period with the definite understanding that their employment is to ter-  
minate upon completion of the project or at the end of the period.  
Employment is expected to continue for more than one (1) year, but  
no more than three (3) years. Term employees are covered by all  
provisions of this Contract except where otherwise provided.  
Term employees are not to be assigned work which would directly  
result in the surplus or layoff of Regular employees in the same title  
and administrative unit to which they are assigned.  
TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES  
1. Temporary employees are those engaged for a specific project or  
a limited period, with the definite understanding that their  
employment is to terminate upon completion of the project or at  
the end of the period, and whose employment is expected to con-  
tinue for more than three consecutive weeks but not for more than  
one year.  
2. All Temporary employees shall be advised of their employment  
status and all pertinent information related thereto at the time of  
hiring.  
3. All provisions of this Contract shall apply to Temporary  
employees, except where otherwise provided.  
4. Should the term of employment of a Temporary employee exceed  
one year, then the employee will be reclassified to a Term  
employee effective with the first day following the completion of  
one year.  
a. The maximum term of employment for a Temporary  
employee who is reclassified to Term under the provisions  
95  
   
of this Section 4.03C4 will be three (3) years from the date  
of hiring as a Temporary employee.  
b. A Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under  
the provisions of this Section 4.03C4 will be eligible for  
Term employee benefits as described in Section 4.03E from  
the time of reclassification.  
c. A Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under  
the provisions of this Section 4.03C4 will be eligible for  
vacation and Personal Days Off in accordance with the pro-  
visions of Article 6, Sections 6.02A1 and 6.04 applicable to  
Term employees, from the date of reclassification. How-  
ever, nothing in this Section will cause such a reclassified  
employee to receive more vacation or Personal Days Off  
than they would have received had they been classified as a  
Term employee from the date of hiring as a Temporary  
employee.  
OCCASIONAL EMPLOYEES  
An Occasional employee is one who is engaged on a daily basis for a  
period of not more than three (3) consecutive weeks, or for a cumula-  
tive total of not more than thirty (30) days, in any calendar year,  
regardless of the length of the daily or weekly assignments. An Occa-  
sional employee who actually works or is engaged to work in excess  
of three (3) consecutive weeks or thirty (30) days in a calendar year  
shall be reclassified as a Regular or Temporary, full-time or part-time  
employee as appropriate.

### ARTICLE 5  
### WORK ADMINISTRATION, COMPENSATION AND  
### SPECIAL PAYMENTS  
### Section 5.01 WAGE SCHEDULES AND PAYMENTS  
### 
A. Employees in titles listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01,  
A4.01 or Appendix B shall be paid at their weekly basic rate of pay for  
forty (40) hours of work. Employees in titles listed in Appendix A,  
Section A3.01 shall be paid at the basic rate per week as established  
for their respective title classifications. The wage schedules and top  
rates of pay shall be as stated in Appendix C3 of this Contract.  
In any case where a Company building is located upon property which  
lies within two (2) exchanges, and if such exchanges are classified dif-  
ferently for wage rate purposes, any employee who is regularly  
assigned to report for work in such a Company building shall be paid  
at the wage rate that pertains to the higher exchange classification.  
B. Except as provided in Section 5.01D, wage increases in the amounts  
shown in the schedules shall be granted automatically on completion  
of the time intervals specified.  
1. No wage increase shall become effective during a period of  
absence in excess of seven (7) calendar days, paid vacations  
excepted.  
a. Aperiod of absence of seven (7) calendar days or less shall  
have no effect on the establishment of the effective date of  
increase.  
b. If the effective date for a scheduled increase occurs during  
a period of absence in excess of seven (7) calendar days, but  
not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, the increase will  
become effective on the day the employee returns to work.  
Such adjustment in the effective date of this increase shall  
not change the date from which the time interval for the next  
increase would otherwise be computed.  
c. If the effective date for a scheduled increase occurs during  
a period of absence of over thirty (30) calendar days, the first  
thirty (30) calendar days of such absence shall be credited  
to the employee’s previously accrued time on the wage  
59  
   
2s  
progression schedule and the increase shall become effec-  
tive either on the day the employee returns to work if the  
employee has been credited with the necessary time interval  
for the next increase, or after the employee has worked the  
remainder of the applicable wage progression time interval.  
In no case shall the application of the provisions of this Section  
5.01B operate to make an increase effective on a date earlier  
than would have resulted had no absence occurred.  
When an employee is absent for more than thirty (30) consecutive cal-  
endar days, only the first thirty (30) calendar days of such absence  
shall be credited to the employee’s previously accrued total schedule  
time on the wage schedule.  
FLEXIBLE STARTING RATES  
1.  
When, in the judgment of the Companies, an increase becomes  
desirable in starting rates for any or all title classifications in a  
particular exchange listed in Appendix C4 of this Contract, the  
Companies will so notify the Union and will discuss with the  
Union both the starting rate and method of progression from the  
new starting rate to the particular existing schedule.  
If the Union and the Companies reach an agreement thereon, the  
schedule for such title classification or title classifications  
between the points where the old schedule is reached and the  
maximum rate, as well as the overall schedule length, will remain  
unchanged; and the employees to whom such altered schedule  
applies will be placed on the altered schedule with the same total  
schedule time they had on the previous schedule.  
If the Companies and the Union fail to reach agreement within  
fifteen (15) days after the above date of notification of said pro-  
posal, such schedule shall remain unchanged.  
The Companies may discontinue or reduce the amount of such  
increased starting rates at any time but such discontinuance or  
reduction shall not cause a decrease in the wage rate of any  
employee whose wage rate was increased under Subparagraph 1  
or 2 of this Section 5.01D. The application of this Subparagraph  
4 shall not result in starting rates lower than those on the old  
schedule.  
60  
An employee hired with previous wage experience credit, military  
service, technical training, typing or key punch skills useful to the  
Companies shall be granted wage credit in accordance with the wage  
credit practice agreement.  
All employees with at least one (1) year of service shall be paid for  
sickness absence beginning with the first scheduled working day of  
absence. Sickness absence payments shall be limited to a maximum of  
five (5) days in the seven (7) day period.  
1. The scheduled working days referred to in this Section 5.01F  
shall be computed in accordance with the pattern of scheduled  
days of the workweek in which the sickness absence first  
occurred regardless of the number of scheduled workdays in that  
week. This pattern shall be deemed to continue into all subse-  
quent workweeks of such absence for determining work time  
lost and days for which sickness absence should be paid.  
2. Sickness absence shall not be deemed to continue into the second  
workweek unless such absence includes the first scheduled day  
of the original work schedule for the second week.  
When employees report on the job for duty on a scheduled day and  
subsequently become sick and are excused by the supervisor before  
completion of their tour of duty, they will be paid at straight time for  
the remainder of the full tour of duty for which scheduled.  
Sickness absence payments referred to in Sections 5.01F and 5.01G  
above shall include any shift or job differentials which the employee  
would have received had the employee worked, but shall not include  
any extra payments which would have been received had the  
employee worked, such as Sunday, holiday, or overtime extra  
payments.  
The supervisor shall decide whether employees with titles listed in  
Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01 or Appendix B, shall work or be  
excused from duty because of bad weather conditions. If the supervi-  
sor decides that the employees cannot work, they shall be paid for the  
balance of the half-tour that they were excused from duty. If the  
employees are notified at or before noon, no payment will be made for  
the afternoon. Employees who do not report for duty shall not be paid  
under the provisions of this Section.  
61  
   
When an employee in titles listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01, is  
transferred from night work to day or evening work at management’s  
request and loses a day’s work opportunity because of the transfer,  
wage payment shall be made for the day lost at straight-time at the  
employee’s normal rate of pay.  
Employees shall be paid bi-weekly, payment of wages due for the two-  
week pay-period to be made when practicable not later than the Friday  
following the last day of the pay-period. When practicable, paychecks  
shall be distributed in sufficient time to permit employees to cash  
their checks within normal banking hours on the regular pay day.  
Section 5.02 RELIEF DIFFERENTIALS  
A.  
A fixed relief differential of eight dollars ($8.00) a day will be paid to  
any employee in any title who, in addition to normal duties or in the  
performance of a new assignment, temporarily relieves or assists a  
manager for a half tour or more. These assignments may involve plan-  
ning, distributing, directing, coordinating and training responsibilities  
other than induction or orientation. The assignment specifically  
excludes disciplining.  
A three dollar ($3.00) daily differential will be paid when an Opera-  
tor relieves a Service Assistant, Service Assistant—Bilingual or a  
Central Office Associate for a half tour or more.  
Section 5.03 SHIFT DIFFERENTIALS (For Pacific Bell  
Home Entertainment, see Appendix B,  
Section B2.07)  
An employee specified in Sections 5.03A1 or 5.03A2 who works a  
regular shift, any part of which falls after 7:00 P.M. or prior to  
6:00 A.M., shall receive a shift differential in accordance with the  
following:  
1. Anemployee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01 or  
A2.01 shall receive a shift differential in the amount of ten (10)  
percent of the employee’s weekly basic rate of pay, except that  
when premium payments are paid for a temporary change of  
shift in accordance with Appendix A, Section A1.05D, or A2.03F  
as appropriate, a shift differential will not be paid.  
62  
Note: An employee who works a scheduled shift on a Sunday or  
Holiday, any part of which falls after 7:00 P.M. or prior to  
6:00 A.M., shall receive a shift differential without regard  
to his/her regular shift.  
a. The shift differential shall be added to the basic rate of pay  
and the combined rate shall be used in computing vacation  
payments, overtime payments, holiday payments and  
Sunday payments, except that the differential shall not be  
added in computing the vacation pay of a regular day shift  
employee who, at the start of vacation, had been working a  
tour for which a differential is paid but who, upon return  
from vacation, is scheduled to work a day shift for a period  
of one (1) week or more.  
b. When only a part of the week is involved, the differential  
shall be prorated on the basis of a five (5) day week, that is,  
one (1) day’s differential is one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly  
differential.  
c. An employee receiving a differential who is temporarily  
assigned to a day shift in connection with training assign-  
ments, vacation reliefs or training reliefs for a period of one  
(1) week or more but less than two (2) weeks shall retain the  
shift differential but shall not receive premium pay for the  
change of shift. Such vacation relief shall be deemed to  
include any additional days which the employee on vacation  
may take immediately preceding or following the  
employee’s vacation.  
An employee who is temporarily assigned to an evening or  
night shift for purposes of training assignments, vacation  
reliefs or training reliefs for a period of one (1) week or  
more shall receive the appropriate shift differential, but shall  
not receive premium pay for a change of shift. Such vaca-  
tion relief shall be deemed to include any additional days  
which the evening or night shift employee may take imme-  
diately preceding or following the employee’s vacation.  
An employee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A3.01B or  
A4.01 shall receive a shift differential in the amount of ten (10)  
percent of the employee’s weekly basic rate of pay, including  
relief differential, if any.  
63  
   
a. The shift differential paid under the provisions of Section  
5.03A2 shall be added to the basic rate of pay in computing  
vacation, overtime, holiday and Sunday payments.  
b. The shift differential shall be for a full-time week of five (5)  
shifts. When an employee works less than a full-time week  
of five (5) shifts to which a differential is applicable, the  
shift differential will be prorated; that is, one-fifth (1/5) of  
the weekly differential will be paid for each full shift  
worked for which the differential is provided in Section  
5.03A2.  
B. An employee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A3.01A or  
A3.01C who works an early morning, evening or night tour of duty  
shall receive a wage differential in an amount specified in Appendix  
C, for the appropriate unit, applying as shown in Appendix A, Section  
A3.05. The wage differential specified is for one (1) full tour of duty.  
The differential will be added to the basic wage rate in computing  
vacation, overtime, holiday and Sunday payments.  
C. An employee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A3.01A or  
A3.01C who works at least part of both sessions of a morning-evening  
tour (split-tour) shall receive a differential of four dollars ($4.00). The  
differential will be added to the basic wage rate in computing vacation,  
overtime, holiday, Sunday and Personal Days Off.

Section B2.05)  
A. The provisions of this Section apply to all employees unless otherwise  
specified. Refer to Appendix A for additional overtime and premium

their tour/shift when immediate services are not required,  
will receive pay treatment as provided in Appendix A,  
Sections Al.05B, and A2.03A.  
If a call-out as specified in Section 5.04H above results in an employee

hour worked, such time may be considered in lieu of a regular  
tour/shift, and, at management’s discretion, the employee may be  
relieved from duty.  
When employees are called for work which requires their immediate

Section 5.05 EXPENSE ALLOWANCE  
A.  
PER DIEM ALLOWANCE AND LODGING  
1. When an employee is temporarily assigned to a work location  
other than the employee’s assigned headquarters and, as deter-  
mined by the Companies, daily travel by the employee would be  
impractical, the Companies may establish a temporary head-  
quarters at a place where suitable board and lodging may be  
obtained or provided, in which case the employee shall be eligi-  
ble to receive an allowance of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per  
diem and lodging at the Companies’ expense.  
2. An employee entitled to receive the per diem allowance and  
lodging at the Companies’ expense under Section 5.05A1 may,  
upon proper management approval and in lieu of the per diem  
allowance and lodging at the Companies’ expense, be granted  
home board and lodging allowance at the rate of thirty-five dol-  
lars ($35.00) per day when the nature of the work will permit and  
the employee establishes a bona fide home at the location of the  
work. When such home board and lodging is authorized, it shall  
67  
   
also be paid for periods not worked on Sundays, holidays, days  
absent due to weather conditions and other authorized absence  
not including vacations.  
An employee entitled to receive the per diem allowance and  
lodging at the Companies’ expense under Section 5.05A1 may,  
upon proper management approval, be granted an allowance at  
the rate of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per day for each day  
worked in lieu of the per diem allowance and lodging at the  
Companies’ expense when the location of the work permits travel  
on the employee’s own time and expense, between the  
employee’s bona fide home and the location of the job. In such  
cases, the thirty-five dollar ($35.00) allowance will only be paid  
for the days actually worked.  
On personal trips over weekends and holidays, an employee who  
is being provided the per diem allowance and lodging at the  
expense of the Companies may, upon proper approval and in the  
event Company transportation is not available, be granted the  
lesser of the following two allowances, but in no case shall pay-  
ment be made for travel time:  
a. Anallowance equivalent to commercial transportation costs  
to the appropriate, as determined by the Companies, com-  
mercial transportation terminal at the employee’s home  
location and return. In addition, the employee will be paid  
the mileage allowance at the agreed upon rate for use of an  
employee’s personal vehicle on Company business for the  
distance between the work location and the commercial  
transportation terminal at the temporary work location and  
return and for the distance from the commercial transporta-  
tion terminal at the employee’s home location to the  
employee’s home and return, or  
b. The actual savings to the Companies due to the employee’s  
absence from the established boarding place.  
The establishment or discontinuance of a temporary headquarters  
as provided for in Section 5.05A1 shall not be considered as a  
change in an employee’s regularly assigned headquarters as  
defined in Appendix A, Sections A1.04E, A2.04 and A4.04C.  
68  
OCCASIONAL MEALS  
Employees shall be granted meal allowances only in accordance with  
the following:  
L.  
Nine dollars ($9.00) when a full-time employee works two (2) or  
more consecutive hours in addition to working his or her regular  
tour/shift or a part-time employee works two (2) or more hours  
in addition to working the equivalent of a full-time tour/shift.  
An additional nine dollars ($9.00) will be paid when a full-time  
employee works six (6) or more consecutive hours in addition to  
working his or her regular tour/shift or a part-time employee  
works six (6) or more consecutive hours in addition to working  
the equivalent of a full-time tour/shift.  
Meals for which an allowance is granted under this Section shall  
be eaten on the employee’s own time, except where the supervi-  
sor determines that the employee cannot be released for a definite  
meal period. In such case, the employee shall be granted a  
reasonable amount of time to eat on Company time.  
There shall be no allowance granted for noonday luncheon  
expense.  
A meal allowance will not be paid to an employee receiving per  
diem or an allowance in lieu of per diem.  
TRANSPORTATION  
1.  
The Companies will either furnish all means of transportation or  
specify what transportation shall be used for Company business  
and advance or refund the necessary fares.  
Local carfare or mileage, as determined by the Companies, to and  
from work in excess of that required by an employee for the  
employee’s normal assignment, will be refunded. Travel time  
will be computed on the same basis except as provided for in  
Section 5.05A3.  
When local carfare during working hours is deemed necessary by  
the Companies, such carfare will be advanced or refunded to  
employees. Carfare in excess of the local fare will be advanced.  
A personal automobile may be used for Company business or to  
facilitate transportation provided that:  
69  
   
a. Such use is authorized by a supervisor.  
The employee agrees to such use of the employee’s personal  
automobile.  
c. Such usage shall be reimbursed at the Internal Revenue  
Service (IRS) reimbursement rate for mileage. In the event  
the IRS increases the re1mbursement rate for mileage, the  
Company will adjust the mileage reimbursement rate to the  
maximum allowable rate as soon as practical, not to exceed  
sixty (60) days from the effective date of the increase.

1.  
2.  
Standby is that time during which an off duty employee is  
scheduled to be available for call-outs.  
Part-time employees are not eligible for Standby pay.  
B. ASSIGNMENT AND EMPLOYEE REQUIREMENTS  
1.  
The Companies will determine the need to establish Standby in  
a work group.

a call-out from the duty supervisor and will be available for con-  
tact via telephone or pager at all times during the period of duty.  
Assigned Standby employees who cannot be reached or who fail  
to respond to a pager, or other agreed upon method of commu-  
nication, within a fifteen (15) minute time period, will not be eli-  
gible to receive payment for the period of Standby coverage.  
If, during a Standby period, an employee becomes ill, or for  
some other reason cannot perform the scheduled Standby duty,  
the employee is responsible for notification of management as  
soon as possible. The employee will not receive Standby pay for  
that period.  
The Companies will follow the established overtime call-out pro-  
cedures when the scheduled Standby employee is not available  
for a call-out or when a special requirement to satisfy a customer  
need exists.  
Employees who transfer or return into the work group or any  
employee who subsequently wants to be added into the Standby  
group, upon notification to the supervisor, will be placed at the  
bottom of the list and be eligible for normal rotation assignment  
effective with the next posted Standby schedule.  
Employees who desire to be removed from the Standby volun-  
teers list shall give written notice fourteen (14) days prior to  
being removed from the list.  
COMPENSATION  
1.  
In addition to normal compensation for time worked during non-  
scheduled hours as a result of a call-out, those employees on  
Standby will receive a payment equal to one and one-half (1-1/2)  
hours pay at the regular hourly rate for each day on Standby.  
Time spent on Standby, exclusive of call-outs, will not be con-  
sidered hours worked, and pay received for Standby will be  
excluded from the regular rate of pay for purposes of calculating  
overtime.  
Standby pay amounts will not enter into computations of any  
payments under the Pacific Telesis Group Plan for Pensions, Dis-  
ability Benefits, Savings and Death Benefits or any other benefits  
or differentials.

Section 5.07 PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES’ PENSIONS,  
A.  
DISABILITY BENEFITS AND DEATH BENEFITS  
In the event, during the life of this Contract, the Companies desire to  
make a change in the Pacific Telesis Group Plans for Employees’ Pen-  
sions, Disability Benefits and Death Benefits which would affect the  
pensions, disability benefits and death benefits of employees within the  
bargaining units, they will, before making a change, notify the Union  
and afford the Union a period of sixty (60) calendar days for bargain-  
ing, provided, however, that no change may be made in the Plans  
which would reduce or diminish the pensions, disability benefits and  
death benefits provided thereunder, as they may apply to employees  
within the bargaining units, without consent of the Union.  
Any claim that Section 5.07A of this Article has been violated may be  
presented as a grievance and, if not resolved by the parties under their  
Problem Resolution Procedures, may be submitted to arbitration pur-  
suant to the provisions of Article 7, but in such case any decision or  
action of the Companies shall be controlling unless shown to have  
been discriminatory or in bad faith, and only the question of discrim-  
ination or bad faith shall be subject to the grievance procedure and  
arbitration. However, nothing in this Contract shall be construed to  
subject the Plan or its administration to arbitration.

uled week immediately preceding the first day of a vacation week.  
VACATION PAY — FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES  
Full-time employees will be paid their basic weekly wage rate for each  
full week of vacation. Pay for individual vacation days will be one-  
fifth (1/5) of the weekly rate.

when the employee would normally be scheduled to work.  
See Section 6.04D for pay treatment of employees who are temporar-  
ily shift-changed for vacation relief.  
An employee who is absent for more than six (6) consecutive months  
due to leave of absence or layoff will be eligible for vacation in any  
subsequent vacation year after returning to work and completing six  
(6) consecutive months of service.  
When the Companies deem it necessary, the Companies may, in sen-  
iority order, offer employees with scheduled vacation on the posted  
work schedule the opportunity to sell a full week(s) or individual  
vacation day(s) of his/her vacation back to the Companies.  
NOTE: The offer of pay in lieu of vacation shall be effective only if  
agreed to by the employee. The employee will receive pay-  
ment for the vacation time sold back to the Companies with  
the employee’s next regular paycheck for the pay period in  
which the vacation time was originally scheduled. A vacancy  
or open slot on the vacation schedule will not be created  
when an employee elects to sell his/her vacation under the  
circumstances described above.

ner’s mother, domestic partner’s father, as well as any other  
persons living generally in the same household.  
Unpaid time off will include approved leaves of absence. A leave of  
absence for personal reasons is a privilege which may be granted to  
employees rather than a right to which they are entitled. Granting a  
leave of absence for a period of over thirty (30) days does not guar-  
antee the employee will be given a position when the leave expires  
unless agreed to in writing at the time the leave is granted.  
Section 6.06 PLANNED TIME OFF  
The scheduling of planned time off will be in seniority order within indi-  
vidual work groups. It is the intent of the parties that employees’ selections  
will be granted to the extent practicable consistent with force requirements  
and the needs of the service.  
A.  
Scheduling of planned time off will be administered by seniority as  
follows:  
1. Vacation — full week  
2.  Vacation/Personal Day Off — day-at-a-time  
3. Personal Day Off — two (2) hour increments  
Vacation schedules will be prepared by the Companies for each occu-  
pational and administrative unit except as provided in Section 6.06B1.  
The selection of vacation dates within each schedule will be on the  
basis of net credited service as shown by the records of the Companies,  
except as provided elsewhere in this Section or unless otherwise  
agreed to.  
79  
   
1. Prior to the preparation of vacation schedules for any vacation  
year, the district level representative of the Companies will meet  
with the President and his or her designated representative of the  
Union Local involved to discuss the appropriate employee  
groups, comprising the employees within the district level’s juris-  
diction, for which such schedules shall be prepared. In the event  
of failure to reach agreement, final determination of the appro-  
priate employee groups shall be made by the Department Head  
or the Department Head’s authorized representative.  
2. Each employee in the bargaining unit defined in Appendix A,  
Section A2.01, except Operations Administrator, Data Adminis-  
trator, Nevada employees and in other bargaining units as agreed  
to by the parties, will have a first choice before anyone who  
splits their vacation makes a second choice. Employees detailed  
to work away from headquarters will at their request be returned  
to their headquarters at the Companies’ expense for one vacation  
period only, during each vacation year.  
3. An employee transferred at management direction will retain  
any vacation period(s) previously scheduled and approved.  
4. When an employee-initiated transfer occurs, management will  
endeavor to accommodate previously scheduled vacation periods  
within the vacation schedule of the employee’s new work group,  
due regard being given to the needs of the service and the indi-  
vidual circumstances of each case.  
Vacation relief assignments for employees listed in Appendix A, Sec-  
tions A1.01, A2.01 and Appendix B, will be posted at the time work  
schedules are posted. This procedure will not apply to relief assign-  
ments for day-at-a-time vacations.  
Prior to the beginning of the vacation year, management will canvass  
the work group to allow the employees to select vacation and Personal  
Days off from available dates. The period during which vacation and  
Personal Days Off can be chosen by seniority rights will cover the 15  
months from December 31st of the current year through March of the  
subsequent vacation year.  
Requests to reschedule Personal Days Off will be made with normally  
not less than 48 hours’ notice. The rescheduling is subject to manage-  
ment approval.  
80  
Requests for a Personal Day Off in two (2) hour increments may be  
requested by the employee, as needed, and will be granted to the  
extent practicable consistent with force requirements and needs of the  
service.  
It is recommended that all employees take at least 10 days off (vaca-  
tion/Personal Days Off) in the vacation year earned for the sake of  
their well being.  
No work will be scheduled on a vacation day or Personal Day Off. A  
vacation week is a calendar week, Sunday through Saturday. When an  
employee’s vacation period spans a full week, no work will be sched-  
uled the Saturday prior to, or Sunday following, the vacation week.  
All vacation may be taken in increments of less than a full week.  
A vacation week of the new year may begin on Sunday of the same  
week in which December 31 falls on or before Wednesday.  
Vacation weeks and Personal Days Off carried over from the previous  
vacation year through March 31 of the subsequent vacation year have  
precedence over selection of current year Time Off only in the first  
three (3) months of the vacation year. Any Time Off carried over from  
one vacation year to the next and not taken by the last day of March  
will be secondary in terms of scheduling to the selection of time off for  
the current vacation year.  
Payment will be made in lieu of all vacation and Personal Days Off  
carried over from the previous vacation year which are not taken by  
December 30 of the following vacation year.  
The Companies will not pay any expenses including per diem and  
lodging incurred by employees when they take individual vacation  
days or Personal Days Off while working at a non-commutable tem-  
porary work location.  
When employees return to work from sickness or accident disability,  
and they have not taken all vacation and/or Personal Days Off for  
which eligible for the vacation year, they may take whatever can be  
accommodated within the remainder of the current vacation year  
through the end of the next vacation year. Time off carried over from  
the previous vacation year, and taken during the first quarter of the  
next vacation year under this provision will take precedence over  
vacation selection for the current vacation year, but will be secondary  
to vacation carried over under the provisions of Section 6.06K.  
81  
   
Employees going on a leave of absence may receive pay in lieu of  
vacation they are eligible to receive or take the vacation upon their  
return. Should the employee return during the same 24 month period  
in which time off can be taken, he or she will receive whatever vaca-  
tion and Personal Days Off that can be accommodated during the  
remainder of the period. Payment will be made in lieu of any time off  
not used.  
Individuals leaving the employ of the Company shall receive payment  
in lieu of vacation and Personal Days Off to which they are eligible  
provided they have worked during the vacation year and have not had  
all of the vacation and Personal Days Off to which they are eligible  
during such period. This includes pro-rata payment of earned vacation  
for those employees who terminate with less than one year of service.  
For purposes of tracking or making payment in lieu of vacation or  
Personal Days Off, all time off earned in the previous vacation year  
must be taken before any time off for the current vacation year can be  
taken. For scheduling purposes, all other Paragraphs in this Section,  
6.06, shall apply.  
82  

### ARTICLE 7  
### PROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCEDURES  
### 
Section 7.01 The Companies and the Union agree that timely interac-  
tion on issues can eliminate the cause for most grievances. While manage-  
ment maintains the right and responsibility to make decisions which affect  
the business, the parties will endeavor to jointly evaluate and plan proposed  
actions that affect the employees, the Union and the Companies.  
Section 7.02 REQUEST FOR UNION REPRESENTATION  
The Companies shall release the appropriate Union representatives who are  
required by the Problem Resolution Procedures.  
A. At any meeting between a management representative and an  
employee in which a formal level of discipline is to be announced, or  
an investigatory interview where the employee may have a reasonable  
basis to expect that disciplinary action may result, a Union represen-  
tative shall be present, if the employee requests.  
1. The employee shall be informed of the subject of the meeting at  
any formal level of discipline or investigatory interview prior to  
the meeting.  
2. The Union representative and the employee shall be allowed a  
reasonable period of time to consult prior to the meeting, if  
requested.  
Section 7.03 COMMUNICATION AND PROBLEM SOLVING  
We must initiate communication to prevent problems as most problems can  
be prevented through timely, open and honest communication.  
A. When operational changes are being considered in a work area that  
will significantly affect the working conditions of one or more employ-  
ees, the manager will communicate these anticipated changes and the  
reasons for them to the appropriate Union representative and solicit  
any input to improve the effectiveness for all concerned. This com-  
munication will generally occur not less than ten (10) calendar days in  
advance of the effective date of such anticipated changes. In matters  
requiring immediate implementation, the minimum time frame shall  
not apply. In these cases, communication and solicitation for input  
from the Union will be conducted at the earliest practical opportunity.  
83

a  
=~  
   
Subsequently, where agreement is reached, communication to the  
employees will be conducted jointly by the manager and the Union  
representative. In all cases, communication to the affected employees  
will not occur prior to a discussion with the appropriate Union  
representative.  
B. When is trending toward disciplinary action for job per-  
formance, for example attendance, quality, quantity, etc., manage-  
ment will normally involve the Union and solicit its input and  
assistance. The manager and the Union representative will work  
jointly to identify and eliminate the cause of the employee’s problem  
to prevent it from recurring.  
C. Union representative identifies an issue or dispute in the work  
area, he or she will interact with the appropriate manager in the work  
area. An effort should be made by both parties to resolve the problem.  
Section 7.04 UNION PRESENTATION  
The grievance procedure is designed to provide a timely, energy effective  
way of insuring equality and fairness in resolving disputes which have not  
been resolved through informal efforts. The Companies and the Union  
agree that it is their objective to resolve all grievances at the lowest level.

within thirty (30) calendar days from the occurrence that an employee  
is affected by the change, whichever date is later.  
B. All other grievances must be presented within thirty (30) calendar  
days from the first occurrence of the action or within thirty (30)  
calendar days from the date of discovery.

dance with the time limits stated in Section 7.04.  
Management will provide the Union with any information  
and/or reasons used as a basis for the grieved action no later  
than ten (10) calendar days following presentation of the  
grievance. This requirement to share information and/or  
reasons for the grieved action applies whether or not a Step  
I meeting is held.  
2. Holding the Step I Meeting  
a.  
b.  
Management will hold the meeting within fifteen (15)  
calendar days following presentation of a grievance.  
Both parties should make every effort to ensure that a Step  
I meeting is held. However, in those circumstances where a  
Step I meeting is not held within fifteen (15) calendar days,  
as stated in Section 7.05C2a and no mutual agreement to  
extend the time limit is reached, or where there is mutual  
agreement to omit the Step I meeting, the grievance shall be  
considered denied by management and will then be  
escalated to Step II of the Grievance Procedure.  
NOTE: If the Step I meeting is not held, management is  
required to provide the information specified in  
Section 7.05C1b.  
3. Following the Step I Meeting  
a.  
Management will inform the Union of the Company’s posi-  
tion and rationale at the conclusion of the Step I meeting.  
86  
D. Step II grievances will be processed according to the following  
method:  
1. Prior to the Step II Meeting  
a. The Union will notify the Company in writing of its intent  
to escalate the grievance to Step I within thirty (30) calen-  
dar days following the Step I meeting, or the date when the  
Step I meeting should have been held as stated in Section  
7.05C2a.  
b. The Union’s failure to notify the Company, of its intent to  
escalate the grievance, within the time limit stated in Section  
7.05D 1a, will result in the grievance being considered with-  
drawn from the Grievance Procedure.

awarded under Sections 7.12 and 7.14.  
3. Following the Step I Meeting  
a. Management will send the Step II Company position to the  
Union and the appropriate Labor Relations Director, in  
accordance with Section 7.07, at the final disposition of the  
Step II meeting for grievances involving issues other than

b. Management will inform the Union of the Company’s posi-  
tion and rationale at the conclusion of all Step II meetings  
involving dismissal grievances.  
E. Step HI grievances (DISMISSAL GRIEVANCES ONLY) will be

1. Prior to the Step IT Meeting  
87  
a. The Union will notify the Company in writing of its intent  
to escalate the grievance to Step II within thirty (30) cal-  
endar days following the final disposition of the Step I  
meeting or the date it was mutually agreed to omit the  
Step II meeting.  
b. The Union’s failure to notify the Company of its intent to  
escalate the grievance, within the time limits stated in Sec-  
tion 7.05Ela, will result in the grievance being considered  
withdrawn from the Grievance Procedure.  
2. Holding the Step III Meeting  
a. Management will hold the Step III grievance meeting within  
thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Union’s written  
intent to escalate the grievance.  
b. Failure to hold the Step HI meeting within the time limit  
stated in Section 7.05E2a or when no mutual agreement to

being deemed as settled in favor of the Union. However, the  
settlement cannot exceed what an arbitrator would have  
awarded under Sections 7.12 and 7.14.  
3. Following the Step II Meeting  
Management will send the Step III Company position to the  
Union and the appropriate Labor Relations Director in accor-  
dance with Section 7.07.  
Pending final settlement of the grievance, the Companies shall not  
thereafter deal directly with the employee concerning said grievance  
without Union concurrence, but shall deal directly with the Union  
representative.  
Section 7.06 SHARING INFORMATION  
A.  
During the Step I meeting, the Companies and the Union will identify  
appropriate areas of concern. During Step I and Step II meetings, the  
Companies and the Union will share facts deemed relevant to the  
grievance by either party.  
Disputes over relevancy of information and photocopies will be  
resolved as follows:  
88  
1. The request should be presented in writing to the manager. If the  
dispute is not resolved at this level within seven (7) calendar

tor level. If not resolved at this level within seven (7) calendar  
days, the Union may elect to:  
4. Arbitrate the issue under the provision of Section 7.10.  
C. The Companies reserve the right to charge the Union for the cost of the  
photocopies including the wages of the operator of the copying equip-  
ment in the event the volume of requests become substantial.  
Section 7.07 COMPANY POSITION  
The Step II or Step III Company position (as described in 7.05D3 and  
7.05E3) shall be sent by certified mail to the National and Local Union in  
writing within five (5) calendar days of the final Step II or Step III griev-  
ance meeting. A copy will also be sent to the appropriate Labor Relations  
Director.  
Section 7.08 UNRESOLVED UNION PRESENTED

occurrence, and to other successive levels of management up to and  
including the Department Manager (or authorized representative) as  
may be required to resolve the grievance without Union intervention.  
B. The resolution of an employee grievance may not be inconsistent with

Section 7.10 ARBITRATION PROCEDURES  
Arbitration cases should be minimal due to effective use of the Problem  
Resolution Procedures. Arbitration should result in timely awards.  
A.  
If the Union is not satisfied with the Companies’ decision at the final  
meeting in the grievance procedure, the Union may request that the  
grievance be arbitrated.  
Any Regular or Term employee dismissed for just cause may have his  
or her case considered under the Arbitration Procedures. However, the  
question as to whether a Regular or Term employee with less than  
twelve (12) months’ net credited service was dismissed without just  
cause will not be eligible for arbitration.  
The National Union will notify the Labor Relations Director, in writ-  
ing, of its desire to meet on the grievance within thirty-five (35) cal-  
endar days of receipt of the Step II or Step III Company position letter  
as described in Section 7.07 above. The meeting between Labor Rela-  
tions and the National Union will be held within fifteen (15) calendar  
days of receipt of the written notice. The National Union may elect to  
waive this meeting and, within the same thirty-five (35) calendar day  
time limit, notify the Companies of its intention to arbitrate the griev-  
ance as specified in 7.10D below. If the Union fails to send either writ-  
ten notice within the time limit stated (35 calendar days), and no  
mutual agreement to extend the time limit has been reached, the  
grievance will be considered withdrawn from the grievance process.  
The Labor Relations Director, or designated representative, will send  
the final Company position letter to the National Union within five (5)  
calendar days of the National Union/Labor Relations meeting. Within  
thirty (30) calendar days following the National Union’s receipt of the  
Companies’ final position letter, as described in this Section 7.10D, the  
Union will notify the Companies in writing of its intention to arbitrate  
the grievance. This notice will specify the issues involved in the griev-  
ance and remedy requested. Specifically it will clarify the Union’s  
original written presentation of the grievance to management. This  
clarification will define the nature of the grievance; the date of the  
occurrence; the contractual article/section alleged to have been vio-  
lated, if applicable, or if not applicable, the source of the alleged  
violation (e.g., MOA name or number, discipline, documentation);  
90  
the name of the grievant; and the remedy sought for the purposes of  
arbitration, expedited arbitration and mediation.  
If the Union does not notify the Companies in writing of its intention  
to arbitrate the grievance within the time limit stated (30 calendar  
days), and no mutual agreement to extend the time limit has been  
reached, the grievance will be considered withdrawn from the griev-  
ance process.  
The first day of the arbitration hearing will be held within six (6)  
months from the date of the Union’s notification in writing of its intent  
to arbitrate the grievance. If the arbitration request involves an  
employee’s dismissal and the six (6) month time limit is exceeded, the  
period used for computation of any back pay liability for the Company  
shall not exceed a date six (6) months from the date of the Union’s  
notification of intent to arbitrate the dismissal issue, except when the  
time limit has been extended by mutual agreement.  
Section 7.11 ARBITRATOR  
A.  
A panel of arbitrators shall be established by the parties for hearing  
expedited and regular arbitration cases. Upon receipt of the Union’s  
intent to arbitrate, each case will be automatically assigned to an avail-  
able arbitrator. The first case so heard under this procedure shall be  
assigned to the arbitrator appearing first on the panel. Subsequent  
arbitration requests shall be assigned to other arbitrators in the order  
of their sequential assignment to the panel. If an arbitrator notifies the  
parties that he or she is unable to accept a case, it will be referred to  
the next arbitrator on the panel.  
Whenever any arbitrator’s pending arbitration requests exceed three,  
additional requests which would otherwise be assigned to him or her  
in the order of rotation shall be referred to the next arbitrator on the  
panel.  
All eligible grievances shall be handled as follows:  
1. Request from the arbitrator, at the time of appointment, two or  
three proposed alternative hearing dates for hearing days within  
six (6) months from the date of the Union’s notification of its  
intent to arbitrate. If the arbitrator cannot provide a hearing date  
within the six (6) month time frame, the parties shall proceed  
through the remaining arbitrators, in order of appearance, until a  
91  
|  
  
iw}  
=  
a  
=~  
   
hearing date can be scheduled in accordance with the time lim-  
its of this Section.  
2. The designated representatives of the Companies and of the  
Union shall promptly agree on a hearing date, secure a firm com-  
mitment on the hearing date from the arbitrator and schedule the  
hearing in accordance with regular procedures.  
3. If the parties can’t agree on a proposed date, then the arbitrator  
shall schedule a hearing date within the six (6) month time frame.  
Grievances involving the suspension of an individual employee or a  
grievance involving the dismissal of a Regular or Term employee  
may be handled in accordance with the Expedited Arbitration provi-  
sions of Section 7.15 by mutual agreement of the Labor Relations  
Director and the designated representative of the National Union,  
except for those which also involve an issue of arbitrability, Contract  
interpretation, or work stoppage (strike) activity and those which are  
also the subject of an administrative charge or court actions.  
Section 7.12 POWER OF THE ARBITRATOR  
A.  
B.  
The Arbitrator has no authority to add to, subtract from, or otherwise  
modify the provisions of the Contract.  
If the Arbitrator finds that a dismissal was made without just cause, the  
Arbitrator will either:  
1. Reinstate the employee with back pay computed in accordance  
with Section 7.14 as limited by Section 7.10E; or  
2. Reduce the dismissal to a suspension and reinstate the employee  
without back pay for the period of suspension set by the  
Arbitrator as limited by Section 7.10E.  
Section 7.13. ARBITRATOR’S DECISION  
A.  
Except as provided in Expedited Arbitration, Section 7.15, the Arbi-  
trator will render a decision within thirty (30) calendar days from the  
date the matter is submitted.  
All decisions within the power of the Arbitrator will be final and  
binding on all parties.  
Decisions rendered under the provisions of Expedited Arbitration,  
Section 7.15, will not constitute a precedent for other cases or  
92  
grievances and may not be cited or used as a precedent in other arbi-  
tration matters between the parties.  
Section 7.14 EFFECT OF RESOLUTION  
A.  
Where employees are reinstated with back pay, the employees will  
receive their regular rate of pay for the time lost, but not for suspen-  
sion time under Section 7.12B2 as limited by Section 7.10E. They will  
also receive reimbursement for any actual expenses incurred and paid  
by the employees during the period of dismissal which would have  
normally been paid by the Companies’ Medical, Dental, or Vision  
Plans. Amounts paid to employees will be reduced by an amount  
equal to the total of the termination or layoff allowance received from  
the Companies at the time of dismissal, and any wages earned in other  
employment. Pacific Bell employees will be liable to the State of Cali-  
fornia, Employment Development Department for overpayment of  
unemployment benefits received since date of dismissal. Nevada Bell  
employees will likewise be liable to the State of Nevada, Employment  
Security Department for such overpayments.  
In the event a grievance is arbitrated under the provisions of Expedited  
Arbitration, Section 7.15, any awarded back pay liability shall be  
computed in accordance with the provisions as expressed in Sections  
7.12B1 and 7.12B2, as limited by Section 7.10E.  
Section 7.15 EXPEDITED ARBITRATION PROCEDURE  
The procedure for Expedited Arbitration will be as follows:  
A.  
B.  
A written stipulation of all facts not in dispute may be submitted to the  
Arbitrator prior to the hearing.  
The hearing will be informal without rules of evidence and without a  
transcript. However, the Arbitrator will satisfy himself or herself that  
the evidence submitted is of a type on which he or she can rely, that  
the hearing is fair in all respects and that all facts necessary to a fair  
settlement and reasonably obtainable are brought before the Arbitrator.  
Each party may submit a brief written summary of the issues raised at  
the hearing and arguments supporting its position within five (5)  
working days after the hearing.  
93  
|  
  
iw}  
=  
a  
=~  
   
D. The Arbitrator will render his or her decision within five (5) working  
days after receiving the briefs. He or she will provide the parties a brief  
written statement of the reasons supporting the decision.  
Section 7.16 ARBITRATION EXPENSES  
The compensation and expenses of the Arbitrator and the general expenses  
of the arbitration will be borne by the Companies and the Union in equal  
parts. Each party will bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses.  
Section 7.17 TIME LIMITS  
The time periods specified in the grievance and arbitration procedures will  
be calendar days except for Section 7.15 and may be extended by mutual  
agreement.  
Section 7.18 MEDIATION  
A. A grievance that has been appealed to arbitration in accordance with  
Section 7.10 may be presented at a mediation conference before it is  
scheduled for arbitration, except when either party requests that medi-  
ation be bypassed.  
B. Within six (6) months of the Union’s request for arbitration, the par-  
ties will schedule a mediation conference to be held at the earliest  
available date of a mediator mutually agreeable to both parties. The  
mediation conference will normally be held in either a Company or  
Union facility. Should the availability of a mediator unnecessarily  
delay the processing of the grievance in the opinion of either party,  
either party may request that the mediation step be bypassed and the  
grievance be scheduled for arbitration.  
C. The spokesperson for the Company will normally be a Staff Man-  
ager—Labor Relations. An Area Representative-Communications  
Workers of America will normally represent the Union. An attorney  
will not be used by either party at the mediation conference. The num-  
ber of employees who shall suffer no loss in pay under Article 3,  
Section 3.02 of the Contract shall be no more than two (2). Should  
additional employees be necessary for the complete discovery of facts  
at the conference, the parties will agree in advance on the number of  
additional employees who will attend the conference and suffer no loss  
in pay under Section 3.02.  
94  
The representatives of the parties are encouraged, but not required to  
present the mediator with a brief written statement of the facts, the  
issue and the arguments in support of their respective positions. If such  
statement is not presented in written form, it shall be presented orally  
at the beginning of the mediation conference.  
The mediation conference will normally be attended by the grievant,  
the Local President, the grievant’s supervisor and District Level  
Manager. Attendance at the mediation conference shall be limited to  
those people actually involved in the mediation conference.  
All written material that is presented to the mediator or to the other  
party shall be returned to the party presenting the material at the ter-  
mination of the mediation conference. The mediator may, however,  
retain one copy of the written grievance, to be used solely for purposes  
of statistical analysis.  
Proceedings before the mediator shall be informal in nature. The pres-  
entation of evidence is not limited to that which has been presented in  
the grievance proceedings. However, the issue mediated will be the  
same as the issue the parties have tried to resolve through the griev-  
ance process. The rules of evidence will not apply, and no record of the  
mediation conference shall be made.  
The mediator will have the authority to meet separately with Company  
or Union representatives, but will not have the authority to compel the  
resolution of a grievance.  
The Company and Union spokespersons at the mediation conference  
may accept the resolution proposed by the mediator and such settle-  
ment or any other settlement resulting from the conference shall not  
be precedent-setting for other cases or grievances and may not be  
cited in any other proceeding between the parties. If no settlement is  
reached during the mediation conference, the mediator shall provide  
the parties with an immediate oral advisory opinion, unless both  
parties agree that no opinion shall be provided. The mediator shall  
state the grounds of his or her advisory opinion.  
If no settlement is reached at the mediation conference, the grievance  
will be heard in arbitration in accordance with provisions expressed in  
Section 7.10. Such hearing will be held within six (6) months of the  
date of the mediation hearing. In the event that a grievance which has  
been mediated subsequently is arbitrated, no person serving as a  
95  
|  
  
iw}  
=  
a  
=~  
   
mediator between these parties may serve as arbitrator. Nothing said  
or done by the mediator may be referred to at arbitration. Any settle-  
ment proposal made by either party at the mediation conference shall  
not be referred to at the arbitration hearing.  
The mediator shall conduct no more than three (3) mediation confer-  
ences per day. The fee and reasonable expenses of the mediator will  
be shared equally by the parties.  
In the event that the mediation of a grievance is scheduled, and then  
postponed or canceled, the parties shall remain liable for the fee spec-  
ified in Section 7.18K, unless another grievance is substituted for that  
grievance postponed or canceled.  
Section 7.19 DISMISSALS  
A.  
The Companies agree that no employee will be dismissed without a  
full and complete investigation by department supervision. The Com-  
panies recognize the right of the Union to assist an employee who has  
been suspended pending investigation, or who has been given notice  
of dismissal, or who has been dismissed, in presenting and/or  
appealing the employee’s case to the Companies.  
When it is necessary to dismiss an employee, the employee must be  
paid in full immediately for all time due. Every employee who is  
dismissed will be paid at the place of dismissal.

### LAYOFFS  
### 
Section 8.01 LAYOFFS (For Pacific Bell Home  
Entertainment, see Appendix B,  
Section B2.01)  
A. The National Union will be notified in writing in the event that any of  
the Companies deems it necessary to lay off Regular employees due  
to a change that will materially alter that Company’s Business Plan  
achievement, as described in Article 2, Employment Security, Section  
2.01.  
B. Employees who are still surplus after having been given the opportu-  
nity to accept reassignment as described in the Force Movement  
process will be laid off in inverse seniority order of net credited  
service.

C. Regular employees who are laid off will be paid a layoff allowance  
determined as to amount by their net credited service and basic weekly  
wage rate at the time of leaving the service, in accordance with the  
   
table below:

97  
For employees with twenty-one (21) or more years of net credited service,  
an additional four (4) weeks’ pay at the current wage rate will be made for  
each additional completed year of service.  
1. For Regular part-time employees, the amount of layoff allowance  
is determined by reducing the employee’s basic weekly wage  
rate in proportion to the average number of hours worked to the  
average number of full-time hours applicable to the tours within  
which the hours were worked during the twenty-six (26) weeks  
immediately preceding the layoff.  
2. Any vacation payment to which the employee is eligible will be  
made in addition to the layoff allowance.  
D. If anemployee who has received a layoff allowance is recalled or reen-  
gaged, and the number of weeks since the effective date of leaving is  
less than the number of weeks’ pay upon which the layoff allowance  
was based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount  
paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks will be consid-  
ered as an advance to the employee by the Companies. Repayment of  
this amount will be made at the time of reemployment, or through pay-  
roll deductions in each payroll period at the rate of at least ten (10) per-  
cent per week of the employee’s basic weekly wage rate, with the  
entire amount to be repaid within twelve (12) months of the date  
reemployed.  
E. who has been laid off and given a layoff allowance is  
subsequently recalled or reengaged and again laid off, the layoff  
allowance in the case of the second layoff or of any subsequent layoff  
will be based on the employee’s net credited service, less any prior  
layoff allowance received and not refunded to the Companies. How-  
ever, no deduction will be made from the second or subsequent layoff  
allowance if the employee has been back at work for at least twenty-  
four (24) months since the date of reemployment.  
F. Employees specifically designated as surplus and laid off will retain  
certain recall rights for twenty-four (24) months following the date  
they left the work group. Recall rights will be administered as follows:  
1. Surplus employees who are laid off must submit a form pro-  
vided by the Companies if they wish to be recalled from layoff.  
On this form, employees may express their preferences for reas-  
signment or placement after recall. They may designate any job  
98  
titles for which they are qualified as the job titles in which they  
wish to be placed should vacancies occur. Employees may also  
designate as many work locations as they wish for placement  
consideration. These location designations may be as specific  
(e.g., a building) or as general (e.g., a city or an entire geograph-  
ical area) as the employees desire. The employees’ preferences  
may be modified by the submission of a revised form as often as  
they wish during the twenty-four (24) month period that the  
employees retain their individual recall rights. Employees laid off  
under the terms of this Section must keep the Companies  
informed of the address where they can be reached.  
Laid off employees will receive placement priority as described  
in Section 2.04B 1b.  
A given employee shall receive only one (1) job offer for a posi-  
tion in the employee’s previous work group. The employee will  
receive only one (1) job offer for a position in the same job title  
in one (1) work location within a headquarters which the  
employee requested. The employee will receive a maximum of  
two (2) job offers in any other job titles for which the employee  
is qualified. If an employee refuses to accept the one (1) job offer  
made in either of the first two (2) cases described above or refuses  
to accept two (2) offers made in the last case, the employee will  
receive no other job offers.  
IF THE EMPLOYEE IS OFFERED THEN  
1. A job in his/her previous work group no other job offers will be made.  
2. A job in the same title in one (1)  
work location which he/she requested no other job offers will be made.  
3. A job in any other title(s) (than the the employee will be entitled  
one held by the employee at the time to one (1) more job offer from either  
he/she was displaced) and declines 1,2, or 3.  
Whenever an employee receives a job offer as described in Sec-  
tion 8.01F3, the employee has three (3) calendar days from the  
date of the offer in which to accept or reject the job offer. If the  
employee accepts a job offer, the employee has fifteen (15) cal-  
endar days from the date of acceptance to report to work. Failure  
to report to work within this period will result in the termination  
of the job offer and the employee will forfeit all recall rights.

### ARTICLE 9  
### OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH  
### 
Section 9.01 Safety is a mutual concern to the Companies and the  
Union. The Companies and the Union recognize and appreciate that a  
healthy and safe work environment is in the best interests of the parties and  
encourage the involvement and participation of employees/Union members  
in safety and health activities. In order to accomplish this goal, the parties  
agree to the following:  
A. Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell will each establish with the Union a sep-  
arate Joint Committee on Occupational Safety and Health (JCOSH).  
Each JCOSH shall consist of three (3) Union appointed representatives  
and three (3) Company appointed representatives. The JCOSHs shall  
be established within thirty (30) days after the ratification of this  
Contract. Each JCOSH shall:  
1. Consider and examine appropriate suggestions from the Union  
and/or Company which would enhance ongoing health and safety  
programs.  
2. Make recommendations on health and safety issues to the  
Company/Union Bargainers, including recommendations on such  
subjects as surveys and studies. The JCOSH does not have the  
authority to formulate policy nor enter into agreements on sub-  
jects which require collective bargaining. The JCOSH is, how-  
ever, encouraged to make recommendations to Company officials  
responsible for health and safety matters, who may in turn author-  
ize the JCOSH to implement recommendations, if appropriate.  
   
3. Facilitate management and union discussion on local and  
statewide safety issues by encouraging open and forthright dis-  
cussions at the Business Unit level. Local and statewide health  
and safety committees shall keep the JCOSH informed and work  
with the JCOSH on issues of mutual concern.  
4. Meet at least quarterly; however, more frequent meetings may be  
held by mutual consent of the members of the JCOSH. Minutes  
of each JCOSH meeting shall be prepared and distributed as  
determined by the Company and Union bargaining  
spokespersons.  
101  
B. Employees of the Companies who are members of the JCOSHs will  
be paid for all meetings in accordance with the provisions of Section  
3.02 of this Contract.

Section A1.02 HOURS OF WORK  
A.

the Company within a shift and which the employee normally  
works.  
2. Ascheduled tour is the eight-hour work period within a shift an  
employee is scheduled to work on a particular day as provided in  
Section A1.03.  
3. All tours or half-tours will be considered as falling within the  
calendar day on which the tour or half-tour commences.  
A regular shift (day, evening or night) is one assigned to an employee  
for a period of two (2) weeks or more, except that training assign-  
ments, vacation reliefs or training reliefs of one (1) week or more are  
regular shifts. Vacation reliefs shall include any additional days which  
the employee being relieved may take immediately preceding or fol-  
lowing the vacation allowed under Article 6, Section 6.02. A scheduled  
shift is the one within which an employee’s scheduled tour falls.  
The day shift includes tours starting at or after 6:00 A.M. and prior to  
12:00 noon. Normal working hours shall be eight (8) consecutive  
hours, starting at 8:00 A.M., exclusive of meal period intermission.  
The evening shift includes tours starting at or after 12:00 noon and not  
later than 7:00 P.M.  
A night shift includes tours starting after 7:00 P.M. and prior to  
6:00 A.M. No tour shall be scheduled for a period of two (2) weeks or  
more, which starts later than 12:00 midnight or before 5:00 A.M.

employees’ specified limits, their working hours shall start and  
finish:  
a. At designated job locations for non-motorized splicing  
Crews.  
106  
b. At Company-owned or rented premises or at customers’  
premises (P.B.X. locations, sub-storerooms, etc.) for all

5.05C2.  
3. are away from headquarters and the location is

start and finish at the camp, hotel or garage designated by the  
supervisor.  
4. The specified limits referred to in this Section are defined in  
Section A1.04.  
When an employee is being transferred at the direction of the Com-  
pany to anew headquarters or moved from one job location to another,  
travel time excluding regular meal periods, shall be considered as  
time worked, except that when sleeping accommodations on com-  
mercial transportation are furnished, travel time falling outside the  
employee’s scheduled tour, or if not scheduled, the employee’s regular  
tour, shall not be paid for.  
Meal period intermission shall normally be one (1) hour. Generally,  
meal period intermissions of less than one (1) hour shall be on the  
basis of an entire work group in the same title classification at a par-  
ticular work location as determined by the Company and the Local  
Union. Where the Company deems it desirable to implement meal  
periods of different lengths, the change will be negotiated with the  
Local Union.  
Meal period intermission may be reduced by mutual agreement  
between the employee and the supervisor.  
1. In those cases where an employee’s scheduled meal period is  
reduced, the employee shall be compensated at the rate of time  
and one-half (1-1/2) for the portion of the scheduled meal period  
the employee works. If the employee prefers, his or her schedule  
shall be adjusted to reflect the reduced meal period and earlier  
quitting time.  
2. In those cases where the employee requests the change, no  
premium payments will be involved.

of the Company, shall be granted a reasonable meal period on Com-  
pany time. Employees must not leave their work without approval of  
their supervisors.

of this Contract, unless an employee is given at least forty-eight (48)  
hours’ notice of a change in the days or hours the employee is sched-  
uled to work, the employee will be permitted to work the days or  
hours originally scheduled and any other time which the employee is  
required to work shall be in addition to that originally scheduled.

shall be paid at the premium rate from the starting time of such period  
of work until relieved from duty.  
All time worked for a period beginning three (3) hours or more before  
the employee’s scheduled tour, or if not scheduled, the employee’s reg-  
ular tour, and continuing until relieved from duty shall be paid for at  
the premium rate.

ing time when the notification to the employee of such a change is  
made after 11:00 P.M. and prior to 6:00 A.M., unless such notification  
is given the employee while at work.  
When an employee is scheduled for a period of less than two (2)  
weeks to a shift other than the employee’s regular shift, all hours  
worked shall be paid for at the premium rate, except as follows:  
1. When the employee requests a change for personal reasons, the  
straight-time rate, including any applicable differential, will be  
paid.

tial but shall not receive premium pay for the change of shift.

days which the employee on vacation may take immediately  
preceding or following the employee’s vacation.

connection with training assignments, vacation reliefs or training  
reliefs for a period of one (1) week or more, shall receive the

E. The Company shall distribute the opportunity to work time which  
requires payment at premium rates as equitably as the needs of the  
service will permit. Representatives of the Company and the Union  
shall endeavor to determine the employee groups which are appropri-  
ate for this purpose. In the event of failure to reach agreement, final  
determination of the appropriate employee groups will be made by the  
Highest Level below Officer or an authorized representative. The  
provisions of this Section shall not be subject to arbitration.  
iL.  
Lists shall be maintained on an accumulative basis for each  
appropriate employee group showing the distribution in terms of  
equivalent hours separately for (1) scheduled Sunday and holiday  
work and other scheduled work paid for at the premium rate; (2)  
all non-scheduled work. When time worked during an  
employee’s normal workweek results in premium payments for  
a scheduled day, only the premium portion shall be included in

employees for training. Nothing in this provision shall limit the Com-  
pany’s right to select employees for training who, in its judgment, are  
best qualified to receive such training. Neither the provisions of this  
Section nor their application shall be subject to arbitration.  
Seniority shall be considered in the assignment of hours within a shift  
among those qualified employees regularly assigned to the shift.  
Whenever two (2) or more shifts which carry the same premium pay-  
ments are scheduled for the same day, employees scheduled to work  
such shifts by the Company may exercise a choice of shifts, at the time  
work schedules are prepared, in the order of their seniority provided

sidered the basic period for determining an employee’s regular  
shift. Each succeeding two-week period shall become the basic  
period forty-eight (48) hours prior to the start of such two-week  
period.  
The posted work schedule for any such two-week period shall not

particular two-week period, except as hereinafter provided in  
this Contract.  
Work schedules will not be posted for employees who normally

Temporary changes on a scheduled day between day, evening or  
night shifts, that is, a change from a day shift to a night shift, a

change in schedule.  
A day shift is a shift starting at or after 6:00 A.M. and prior to 12:00

Assigned shifts on Sundays and holidays shall be such hours as the  
service may require and shall not be for less than four (4) hours.  
Employees working evening and night shifts, and employees working

The workweek shall normally consist of five (5) full shifts within a  
calendar week. When necessary, the workweek may consist of full  
shifts on certain days and half-shifts on the other days. Not more than  
two (2) half-shifts per employee shall be scheduled in any one work-  
week. Employees scheduled to work on Sunday shall be scheduled  
four (4) additional consecutive days.  
Holidays paid for which fall on an employee’s scheduled workday  
shall be considered a part of the normal workweek described above  
whether worked or not.  
Meal period intermission shall normally be one (1) hour. Generally,  
meal period intermissions of less than one (1) hour shall be on the  
basis of an entire work group in the same title classification at a par-  
ticular work location as determined by the Company and the Local  
Union. Where the Company deems it desirable to implement meal  
periods of different lengths, the change will be negotiated with the  
Local Union.  
Meal period intermission may be reduced by mutual agreement  
between the employee and the supervisor.  
1. In those cases where an employee’s scheduled meal period is  
reduced, the employee shall be compensated at the rate of time  
and one-half (1-1/2) for the portion of the scheduled meal period

The specified limits referred to in this Section shall generally be the  
base rate area boundary of an exchange.  
1. Employees working within specified limits shall report on the job  
or at the garage, in accordance with their supervisor’s instruc-  
tions, at the beginning of their regular shift and leave the job or

ular shift at the garage or other location within the specified  
limits in accordance with their supervisor’s instructions.  
2. When the location of the work is such that there are no specified  
limits the Company will provide transportation from the hotel,  
camp or garage to the work and return, to be used at the option  
of the employee. Shifts shall start and end at the hotel, camp or

D. Overtime will apply to all time consumed in traveling when employ-  
ees are being transferred to new headquarters or moved from one job  
location to another when such traveling follows and is a continuation  
of a regular shift, provided that when sleeping accommodations are  
furnished, no overtime will be allowed.  
E. Except as provided for in Article 5, Section 5.011 and Section 5.04H  
of this Contract unless an employee is given at least forty-eight (48)  
hours’ notice of a change in the days or hours the employee is sched-  
uled to work, the employee will be permitted to work the days or  
hours originally scheduled and any other time which the employee is  
required to work shall be in addition to that originally scheduled.  
The foregoing paragraph will not apply under the following  
conditions:  
1. When changes in days to be worked are made at the employee’s  
request, with the approval of supervision.  
2. When changes are made between day, evening or night shifts for  
which a premium is paid.  
3. When an employee is scheduled to work and is excused with pay.  
F. Changes from the regular shift will be paid for at the rate of one and  
one-half (1-1/2) hours’ pay for each hour worked off shift and the pre-  
mium payment will cease when the employee’s regular shift resumes.  
A change of shift is interpreted to mean a change between day, evening  
or night shift. When an employee requests a change in shift for  
personal reasons, straight-time will be paid.  
G. The Company will endeavor to distribute the opportunity to work  
extra time which requires payment at premium rates as equitably as the  
needs of the service will permit. The Company will determine the  
employee groups which are appropriate for this purpose. No grievance  
arising from the application or interpretation of this Section shall be  
subject to arbitration.

Section A3.04 SENIORITY  
A.  
The establishment of employees’ seniority dates is governed by such  
rules of procedure as are agreed upon from time to time by the Union  
and the Company. For this purpose, net credited service, as shown by  
the records of the Company, shall be used unless changed by mutual  
agreement.  
Equitable assignment of hours of work and vacation periods shall be  
made by allowing employees precedence in selection of assignments  
from the schedules in accordance with the order of their established  
seniority dates.  
In making assignments in higher-rated non-management title classifi-  
cations specified in Section A3.01, the Company will select the  
employee who, in its judgment, is best qualified for the assignment.  
When two or more employees are judged by management to be  
equally qualified, seniority shall determine the choice. The provisions  
of this Section may be referred to the grievance procedure set forth in  
Article 7, Section 7.05 but neither the provisions of this Section nor  
their application shall be subject to arbitration.  
All seniority considerations are subject to the needs of the service,  
which include any and all requirements necessary to protect the serv-  
ice, to meet satisfactory adjustments and scheduling of the force, to  
care for training needs and to determine the qualifications of an  
employee for an assignment. Determination of the “needs of the  
service” rests solely with management.  
For employees temporarily transferred between exchanges within the  
territorial limits of this bargaining unit, or into the territory covered by  
this bargaining unit, seniority in regard to selection of hours at the  
exchange to which they are transferred will start with the date of  
temporary transfer.  
Section A3.05 DIFFERENTIALS  
A.  
An employee having a title listed in Section A3.01A who works an  
early morning tour beginning before 6:00 A.M., or an evening or night  
tour of duty shall receive the wage differential applying as shown  
below. The amount of wage differentials as specified in Appendix C,  
is for one (1) full tour of duty. The differential will be added to the  
122  
basic wage rate in computing vacation, overtime, holiday and Sunday  
payments.  
1.  
If a tour to which a differential is applicable is worked as  
assigned, the full differential is payable.  
If a tour to which a differential is applicable is not completed due  
to an employee’s being excused, the full differential is payable if  
the remainder of the tour is paid for.  
If a tour to which a differential is applicable is not completed due  
to an employee’s being absent, whether excused or unexcused,  
and the remainder of the tour is not paid for, the differential  
payable will be the differential, if any, applicable at the end of the  
time paid for, except as provided herein:  
a. When an employee assigned to work a seven and one-half  
hour evening tour leaves the job and is paid to a time when  
an eight-hour differential is in effect, or when an employee  
assigned to work a seven-hour evening tour leaves the job  
and is paid to a time when a seven and one-half or eight-  
hour differential is in effect, or when an employee assigned  
to work a six-hour evening tour leaves the job and is paid to  
a time when a seven-hour, seven and one-half hour or eight-  
hour differential is in effect, the differential shall be the  
lowest differential applicable to the type of tour (seven and  
one-half, seven or six-hour) originally assigned.  
b. employee will receive the full night differential  
when absent part of the tour.  
A full differential is payable for a part-time evening tour, and an  
uncompleted part-time assignment is subject to the same treat-  
ment accorded full-time assignments in Section A3.05A3.  
For each day of paid vacation or each day of excused time paid  
for and of each paid holiday not worked, an employee will  
receive the normal daily differential as shown in Appendix C.  
Where an employee’s assignments are such as to vary in the  
frequency and amount of differential paid, the assignments for  
the days on which the employee was absent will determine the  
differential to be paid, or, if no assignment has been made, the  
differential applying shall be determined as follows:  
123  
>  
a]  
a)  
mi  
  
=  
p=  
  
   
a. The differential, if any, for paid days of a vacation week  
shall be that applicable to the first five (5) assigned work-  
days or paid days of the week preceding the start of vaca-  
tion.  
b. The differential for a day of excused time paid for or a paid  
holiday not worked shall be that applicable to the assign-  
ment on the corresponding day of the preceding calendar  
week. If the corresponding day of the preceding week was  
not an assigned workday, then the differential applicable to  
the last assigned workday, preceding the absent day or  
holiday, shall apply.  
Relief of an employee in a higher-rated title, other than as specified in  
Section A3.05B4 shall be compensated for by a daily differential, if  
such period of relief is half a tour or more and provided the relieving  
employee is qualified by training or experience, as determined by the  
Company, as follows:  
1.  
Three dollars ($3.00) when an Operator relieves a Service Assistant,  
Service Assistant — Bilingual or Central Office Associate.  
Eight dollars ($8.00) when a central office employee relieves an  
employee with any management title.  
Eight dollars ($8.00) when an employee with a title listed in  
A3.01B relieves a management employee provided the relieving  
employee assumes all the duties of the relieved employee. Three  
dollars ($3.00) when an employee with a title listed in A3.01B  
relieves a higher-rated employee also listed in A3.01B provided  
the relieving employees assumes all the duties of the relieved  
employee.  
The appropriate higher-rated title shall be assigned effective with  
the first day of duty relieving an employee having a higher-rated  
title when the relief assignment 1s:  
a. Ona full-time basis for at least five (5) full tours within a  
period of seven (7) consecutive days, or  
b. planned to continue for four (4) consecutive weeks or longer  
and is for at least two and one-half (2-1/2) days per week,  
or  
124  
c. has been worked at least two and one-half (2-1/2) days per  
week for a period of four (4) consecutive weeks or more.  
C. An Operator who, for half a tour or more, operates the control position  
of a switchboard designed for Operator training shall be paid a daily  
differential in the amount of forty cents ($.40) above the employee’s  
basic wage rate.  
D. The differential specified in Section A3.05B and Section A3.05C will  
be added to the basic wage rate in computing payments for overtime  
work and time worked on holidays and Sundays. Such differentials  
shall not be added to the basic wage rate in computing payments for  
vacations, holidays not worked and other excused paid time.  
E. Services Specialists shall be paid in accordance with the applicable  
wage schedules included in Appendix C. Services Specialists who  
relieve employees carrying a higher job title will be paid in accordance  
with Article 4, Section 4.02 or Service Specialists who relieve a  
manager will be paid in accordance with Article 5, Section 5.02.  
The relief differential specified above will be added to the basic wage

Work schedules shall be posted to show the normal week, scheduled  
Sundays, shift (day, evening or night) and hours. Such schedules shall  
cover not less than a two-week period and shall be posted at least  
forty-eight (48) hours prior to the start of such period. When work  
schedules are posted to cover periods of more than two (2) weeks, the  
first two-week period shall be considered the basic period for deter-  
mining an employee’s regular shift. Each succeeding two-week period  
shall become the basic period forty-eight (48) hours prior to the start  
of such two-week period.  
1. The posted work schedule for any such two-week period shall not  
be changed less than forty-eight (48) hours before the start of the  
particular two-week period, except as hereinafter provided.  
2. Temporary changes on a scheduled day between day, evening or  
night shifts, that is, a change from a day shift to a night shift, a  
night shift to an evening shift, etc., shall not be construed as a  
change in schedule.  
3. Work schedules will not be posted for employees who normally  
work the same hours within a day shift, Monday to Friday,  
inclusive.  
4. Temporary changes from a regular shift for periods of one (1)

ticular work location as determined by the Company and the Local  
Union. Where the Company deems it desirable to implement meal  
periods of different lengths, the change will be negotiated with the  
Local Union.

1. In those cases where an employee’s scheduled meal period is  
reduced, the employee shall be compensated at the rate of time  
and one-half (1-1/2) for the portion of the scheduled meal period  
the employee works. If the employee prefers, his or her schedule  
shall be adjusted to reflect the reduced meal period and earlier  
quitting time.  
2. In those cases where the employee requests the change, no  
premium payments will be involved.  
Employees working evening and night shifts, and employees working  
on day shifts where the needs of the service require it in the judgment  
of the Company, shall be granted a reasonable meal period on Com-  
pany time. Employees must not leave their work without approval of  
their supervisor.

service will permit. Representatives of the Company and the Union

determination of the appropriate employee groups will be made by the  
highest level below Officer or an authorized representative. The  
provisions of this Section shall not be subject to arbitration.  
1. Lists shall be maintained on an accumulative basis for each  
appropriate employee group showing the distribution in terms of  
equivalent hours separately for 1) scheduled Sunday and Holiday  
work and other scheduled work paid for at the premium rate; 2)  
all non-scheduled work. When time worked during an  
employee’s normal workweek results in premium payments for  
a scheduled day, only the premium portion shall be included in  
the list. Such lists shall be made available in a place mutually  
agreeable for ready inspection by any employee in the group.  
Except as provided for in Article 5, Section 5.04H of this Contract
