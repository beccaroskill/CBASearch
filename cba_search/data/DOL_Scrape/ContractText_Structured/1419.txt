### SAFETY CLAUSE  
### 
SECTION 1. It shall be a condition of this Agreement that all employ-  
ees and Contractors shall comply with the safety provisions set down in  
OSHA, the Construction Safety Act of 1969, and the Safety Code of Ohio,  
including revisions. It shall be a condition of employment that all employ-  
ees use and wear the safety equipment provided by the Contractor and  
practice the safety procedures specified by the Contractor, the State Safety  
Code and the Federal Safety Laws. Refusal to comply will subject em-  
ployees to immediate dismissal without recourse.  
SECTION 2. Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy. The Employer and  
Union are committed to a policy that promotes safety in the work place  
and employee health and well-being. In consideration of this policy, the  
Union and the Employer agree that any employee found to be under the  
influence of, or engaged in the distribution of drugs or alcohol on the job  
site, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate  
discharge.  
Within two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new Carpenter  
may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a prescription drug  
which may impair mental or motor function, shall inform their supervisor in  
writing of such drug use.  
Employee involvement with drugs and alcohol can adversely affect  
job performance and employee moral. In the construction industry, the  
consequence of drug or alcohol use while on the job can be disastrous.  
ine Empioyer and Union, therefore agree to the foliowing poticy to insure  
all employees of a safe and efficient job site, free from the effects of drug  
and alcohol use or influence.  
Any job site is subject to massive drug screening. Any employee who  
is involved in an on-the-job accident resulting in an injury to a person or  
property, or whose behavior raises reasonable suspicion of probable cause  
of illegal drug or alcohol use impairment while on the job site, may be  
required, as a condition of continued employment, to submit to a test for  
alcohol and/or illegal drug use which impaired the employee's ability to  
safely perform his/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a  
sampling of the employee’s blood, urine or breath. Any employee who is  
asked to submit to such a test will be required to sign a consent form. If an  
employee, who is asked to submit to a test, refuses to do so or refuses to  
sign the necessary consent form, that employee will be subject to disci-  
plinary action up to and including discharge.  
-16-  
All testing will be done by a reliable, established laboratory. If this  
initial test screen result indicates a positive finding, further testing of the  
same sample must be done to confirm the original findings before the  
laboratory can report a positive finding. The confirmation test will be con-  
ducted by an Accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of  
American Pathology Laboratory and will utilize the more scientific Gas  
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry examination (GC/MS). The results  
of all tests will be kept confidential between the employee, the Employer,  
and the Union. The employee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wage  
and fringes for the time required for drug testing provided the results are  
negative.  
lf the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee shall be granted  
a leave of absence for up to thirty (30) days for the purpose of drug and  
alcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible, such rehabilitation pro-  
grams may be covered under the Ohio Carpenters Health and Welfare  
program providing the employee confines him/her self to a twenty-four  
(24) hour licensed rehabilitation facility.  
Until the employee presents certification of Successful completion of  
the rehabilitation program he/she shall be removed from the Employer's  
job site; and shall not be dispatched to work. Upon presentation of certi-  
fication of the employee’s successful completion of the drug/alcohol reha-  
bilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her original job  
with the Employer. The employee shall, for the next twelve (12) month  
period, present to the District Council representative, drug/alcohol tests  
results, failure to do so will result in the employee, if working, to be re-  
moved from work.
