To these ends the  \nEmployer and the Union agree as follows:  \n1. The Employer shall give the Union twenty-  \nfour (24) hours\u2019 notice of its need for workers,  \nand within such 24 hour period shall not hire  \npersons not referred by the Union. If, however,  \nthe Union fails to refer workers within such 24  \nhour period after having been notified to do so,  \nthe Employer shall have the right to hire per-  \nsons not referred by the Union.  \n2. In notifying the Union of its need for work-  \ners, the Employer shall specify to the Union {a)  \nthe number of workers required, (b) the location  \nof the project, (c) the nature and type of con-  \nstruction involved, (d} the work to be performed,  \nand (e) such other information as may be\u2019nec-  \nessary to enable the Union to make proper re-  \nferral of applicants.  \n3. The Employer shall have the right to de-  \ntermine the competency and qualifications of the  \nempioyee referred by the Union, and the right to  \nhire or not hire accordingly.  \n4. The selection of applicants for referral to  \njobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and  \n10  \nshall not be based on, or in any way affected by  \nUnion membership, bylaws, rules, regulations,  \nconstitutional provisions or any other aspect or  \nobligation of union membership, policies or re-  \nquirements.  \n5. The Union shall register and refer all ap-  \nplicants for employment on the basis of the pri-  \nority groups listed below. Each applicant shall  \nbe registered in the highest priority group for  \nwhich he or she qualifies.  \nGROUP A  \nAll applicants who have worked as Operat-  \ning Engineers for the past four (4) years; have  \nbeen employed for an aggregate time of at least  \none (1) year during the last four (4) years by  \nemployers who are parties to the Collective Bar-  \ngaining Agreements with the Union, not contain-  \ning discriminatory referral provisions; and who  \nhave maintained residence for the past year  \nwithin the geographical area constituting the  \nnormal construction labor market as hereinafter  \ndefined.  \nGROUP B  \nAll applicants for employment who have  \nworked as Operating Engineers for the past four  \n11  \n(4) years and have been employed for an ag-  \ngregate time of at least six (6) months during  \nthe last four (4) years by employers who are  \nparties to Collective Bargaining Agreements with  \nthe union, not containing discriminatory referral  \nprovisions.  \nGROUP C  \nAll applicants for employment who have  \nworked as Operating Engineers for the past two  \n(2) years and who have maintained residence  \nfor the past year within the geographical area  \nconstituting the normal construction labor mar-  \nket, hereinafter defined.  \nGROUP D  \nAll applicants for employment who have  \nworked as Operating Engineers for one (1) year.  \nGROUP E  \nAlt other applicants for employment.  \n6. The Union shall maintain a separate list  \nfor each of the five Groups set forth above, and  \nshall tist the applicants within each Group in the  \norder in which they register as available for em-  \nployment.  \n12  \n7. In referring applicants to the Employer,  \nthe Union shall first refer applicants in Group A  \nin the order of their places on the list, and then  \nrefer applicants in the same manner succes-  \nsively from the lists for Groups B, C, etc. Any  \napplicant who is rejected by the Employer shall  \nbe restored to his place on the list for his Group.  \nWhen a registrant is referred for employment and  \nis actually employed on a job for more than five  \n(5) days, such name shall be re-  \nmoved from the list. When his employment ter-  \nminates he shall be registered at the bottom of  \nthe appropriate Group list on which he is en-  \ntitled to be registered. If a registrant, upon being  \nreferred for employment in regular order, refuses  \nto accept the employment, such  \nname shall be placed at the bottom of the Group  \nlist on which he is registered.  \n8. Re-registrations for referral shall be ac-  \ncepted by the Union at any time during its cus-  \ntomary office hours. New registrations shall be  \naccepted by the Union at least once each week  \nduring office hours. Reasonable notice of new  \nregistration periods shall be posted by the Union  \nin the union office and in any other place where  \nnotices to employees and applicants for employ-  \nment are customarily posted.  \n13  \n9. The Union will use its best efforts to no-  \ntify an applicant for referral when such applicant  \nis to be referred to a job pursuant to the request  \nof the employer but assumes no obligation or  \nresponsibility for failure to locate such applicant.  \n10. The priorities of referral set forth in para-  \ngraph 5 above shall be followed except that in  \ncases where the Employer requires and calls  \nfor employees possessing special skills and  \nabilities, the Union shall pass over any appli-  \ncants on the register not possessing such spe-  \ncials skills and abilities.  \n*The Employer shall request only men who  \nare registered out of work in Group A only, and  \nthey shall have been a former employee who has  \nworked for the requesting Employer in the past  \nyear in the geographical area. All requests shail  \nbe in writing. Applicant must have been on the  \nreferral register at least five (5) days before em-  \noloyee can be requested by the Employer. If an  \nemployee is called back to the same Employer  \nwithin five (5) working days, such employment shali  \nbe considered continuous and shall  \nbe counted as such. In cases where the union does  \nnot have twenty-four (24) or more hours to fill an  \norder for referral for a few-day job (5 or less days)  \nthe Union may pass over applicants on the regis-  \nter in order to promptly fill the order.  \n14  \n11. The Union shall require all job applicants  \nwho have not previously registered to submit a  \nresume of experience and qualifications.  \n12. In the event any job applicant is ag-  \ngrieved with respect to the functioning of this  \nhiring agreement, he may, within ten (10) days  \nfollowing the occurrence of the event which con-  \nstitutes the basis for the grievance, file with the  \nperson in charge of registration and referral a  \nwritten statement of the grievance clearly and  \nspecifically setting forth the wrong or violation  \ncharged. An Appellate Tribunal consisting of an  \nEmployer-Representative, a Union-Representa-  \ntive and an impartial Chairman appointed jointly  \nby the Employer and Union, shall consider such  \ngrievance and render decisions which shall be  \nbinding. The Appellate Tribunal is authorized to  \nissue procedural rules for the conduct of its busi-  \nness, but is not authorized to add to, subtract  \nfrom, or modify any of the provisions of this  \nAgreement and its decision shall be in accord  \nwith the Agreement.  \n13. The Union and the Employer shai! post  \nin places, where notices to employees and ap-  \nplicants for employment are customarily posted,  \nall provisions of this hiring hail Agreement.  \n15  \nDEFINITIONS  \n14.
