understanding, etc. the event the Union enters into, renews,  
or amends any agreement, ora! or written, with any Employer(s)  
or affecting any Employer(s), doing work in the geographical  
area covered by this Agreement, which agreement contains,  
allows or permits any terms and conditions that are different in  
any manner from those terms and conditions expressed herein,  
then, in that event, any Employer signatory to this Agreement  
(either individually or as a member of a multi-employer group)  
shall have the option of adopting such different agreement by  
written notification to the Union. From the date of said notifica-  
tion, this Agreement shall be deemed amended accordingly.  
The Union further agrees that if it should enter into, amend or  
renew any agreement referred to in this Article it will notify, with-  
in ten (10) working days, the Chairman, AGC/C Collective  
Bargaining Committee. The failure to provide such notice will be  
a breach of this Agreement. The Union will allow any qualifying  
Employer to sign this full agreement.  
It is understood that the Union may negotiate agreements  
with specialty subcontractors containing terms and conditions  
which are different from those terms and conditions set forth in  
this Agreement (notice to be provided to AGC/C within ten (10)  
days}. To the extent any Employer signatory to this Agreement  
performs any of the types of work specifically covered by any  
different agreement, then such Employer may exercise its  
option to adopt the different terms and conditions, provided the  
requesting Employer becomes signatory to said agreement.

agreement with the Union during the term of the preceding  
2001-2004 Agreement. Any Employer that enters into this

Agreement after one year after signing this Agreement. If the  
Agreement is not terminated within one year, this “trial agree-  
ment” shall become a full term Agreement or may be extended

fringe benefit rates set forth in the pre-determined wage are Jess  
than the contract rate, the Employer will pay the contract rate  
and reduce the wage rate accordingly. If, through the exercise  
of this Article, a different term or condition should result, the  
Employer will only be allowed to use such different term or con-  
dition on the specific government project.  

### ARTICLE 22  
### ECONOMIC RELIEE  
###

ects, thus creating more work opportunities for bargaining unit  
employees.  
The Employer agrees to have thoroughly considered the  
competitive provisions already established in this Agreement  
such as full use of apprentices and provisional Carpenters and  
the availability of skilled employees provided by the hir-  
ing hall before requesting any economic relief.  
The Union agrees to address the requests in the spirit of  
maintaining or recovering work opportunities for its members.

Secretary/Treasurer of the Mountain West Regional Council of  
Carpenters will address Employer requests for economic relief.

— 53 —  
working days after the request is received. The Union may  
grant, modify or deny the request.  
The Union will notify every Employer signatory to this  
Agreement bidding the project of any relief granted or denied.

every effort will be made to perform work covered by this  
Agreement using bargaining unit employees.

purposes of renegotiating this Agreement generally, shall not be  
abused by the Employer, and shall only be requested by the  
Employer when the circumstances warrant. The Union is obli-  
gated to abide by the spirit and letter of this provision.  
This Article shall not be utilized by the Employer in the  
administration of Article 20, Equal Treatment, and Article 21,  
Government Work.  

### ARTICLE 23  
### SELF-PERFORMED WORK  
### 
It is recognized by both parties to this Agreement that self-  
performance of work covered herein is beneficial for training,  
trust fund viability and promotion of the carpentry craft and the  
construction industry. Therefore, the Employer agrees to give  
due consideration to seif-perform or sub-contract to signatory  
Employers.  
—54~-

tion of the work covered herein, the Employer will not exclude  
any Subcontractors, on the basis of Union affiliation, from bid-  
ding or negotiating the work. Notwithstanding, the Employer is  
not restricted in any manner from subcontracting to any  
Subcontractor of choice, any or all of the work covered under  
this Agreement.  

### ARTICLE 24  
### AN LAUSE  
### 
It is not the intention of either party signatory hereto to vio-  
late any federal or state laws governing the employment of  
employees covered by this Agreement. Both parties agree that  
if any portion or part of this document is determined to be illegal  
under prevailing laws or regulations, the remainder, not so  
affected, shall remain in full force and effect, if it is possible to  
separate such illegal portion or part. In any event, an immediate  
conference of the parties involved will be called to assure a uni-  
form understanding of the issue.  

### ARTICLE 25  
### ENTIRE AGREEMENT  
###

understandings between the Employer and the Union. Nothing  
outside of this Agreement shall modify, change or add to its  
terms and provisions except for amendments agreed to in writ-  
ing by both parties. The parties to this Agreement assume full  
responsibility for their actions insofar as the terms of this
