Any  \npayment which is not made in full or any  \nreport which is not completed in full will not  \ncomply with the requirements hereunder. If an  \nEmployer has no covered employees during a  \nreposting period, he shall still file a remittance  \nreport duly noting there were no covered  \nemployees during the period.  \nSection 6. The Employer agrees to abide by  \nthe terms and conditions of the Agreement and  \nDeclaration of Trust of each of the Funds list-  \ned in Sections 1 through 5 of this Article XVI,  \nas heretofore and hereafter adopted by the  \nTrustees pursuant to such Agreements, as  \namended. The Employer accepts the  \n42,  \n\u201cEmployer Trustees\u201d heretofore or hereafter  \n' designated pursuant to such Trust Agreements  \nas his representatives to administer such  \nFunds. The Employer hereby ratifies all action  \nalready taken or to be taken by the Trustees of  \neach of the Funds within the scope of their  \nauthority.  \nSection 7. Notwithstanding anything in this  \nAgreement to the contrary, if the Employer  \nfail to properly and timely report and/or  \npay on all employees covered by this  \nAgreement the Union may, at its option, strike  \nand/or picket said Employer on the day fol-  \nlowing the day on which such payments  \nand/or reports are due or at any time there-  \nafter, and said strike and/or picketing may be  \ncontinued unti} such time as the Employer  \nproperly reports and/or makes the required  \npayments plus any liquidated damages and  \ninterest which may have accrued thereon.  \nSection 8. The Employer and the Union rec-  \nognize and acknowledge that the regular and  \nprompt payment of the payments required to  \nbe made under Sections 1 through 5 of this  \nArticle are essential and that it would be  \nextremely difficult to fix the actual expense  \nand damage to the Funds, to the Union and to  \nthe employees which would result from the  \nfailure of the Employer to make such pay-  \nments within the time provided by Section 6  \n43  \nhereof. Accordingly, the amount of damage  \nresulting from each such failure shall be pre-  \nsumed to be the sum of Fifty Dollars ($50.00)  \nper delinquency or twenty percent (20%) of  \nthe amount due, whichever is greater, which  \namount shall become due and payable to the  \nFund as liquidated damages and not as a  \npenalty, upon the day immediately following  \nthe date on which such payment became delin-  \nquent, and shall be in addition to the delin-  \nquent payment. In addition, interest at the rate  \nof 18% per annum of each monthly delinquen-  \ncy shall be paid from the date of delinquency.  \nSection 9. The Employer agrees to send  \nwith its required payments under this Article a  \nremittance report form in the format prepared  \nby the Funds setting forth for each employee  \nwho worked during the month for which the  \npayments are made his name, social security  \nnumber, the hours worked during the month  \nand such other pertinent information as may  \nbe required. If the Employer should fail to  \nsubmit a remittance report setting forth the  \ninformation required to be stated thereon, the  \nstatute of limitations with respect to such fail-  \nure on any amount which should have been  \nremitted to the Funds therewith shall not begin  \nto run until the Employer complies with its  \nduty to report on all employees. The Employer  \n44  \nhereby waives the defense of the statute of  \nlimitations on suits to collect payments due  \nbut not reported to the Funds.  \nSection 10, Any Employer required to make  \npayments under this Article shall, upon  \ndemand of the Trustees, deposit with any of  \nthe Funds listed in Sections 1 through 4 of this  \nArticle the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars  \n($10,000.00) per fund, or a bond in a form  \nacceptable to the Trustees of the Fund for the  \nSame amount. At the termination of this  \nAgreement, any sum or bond on deposit and  \nnot applied to unpaid payments shall be  \nreturned to the Employer or its successor with-  \nout interest. The Union agrees that the Labor  \nRelations Division of the Maryland Chapter of  \nthe Associated General Contractors of  \nAmerica, Inc. may make the payments or post  \nthe bond required by this Section for its mem-  \nbers who have given it written authorization to  \nnegotiate with the Union and further agrees  \nthat the maximum payments or bond to collec-  \ntively cover all such members shall be limited  \nto Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). -  \nSection 11. The Employer hereby acknowl-  \nedges that the Trustees of the Funds listed in  \nSections | through 4 of this Article have a  \nsubstantial interest in the enforcement of the  \nprovisions of this Article for the benefit of the  \n45  \nemployees covered by this Agreement. \u00a9  \nAccordingly, the Employer agrees that the  \nTrustees shall have the right, through their  \ndesignated representative, to inspect, audit and  \ncopy the payroll records of the Employer with  \nrespect to employees covered by this  \nAgreement, to sue for the collection of any  \nsums due under this Article without the neces-  \nsity of joining the Union or any employee or  \nany other party in such action, and generally  \nto enforce the provisions of this Article as ful-  \nly as if they were parties hereto. Upon request  \nof the Trustees of the Construction Workers\u2019  \nTrust Fund, the Employer agrees to execute a  \nstandard Health and Welfare Agreement used  \nby the Fund.  \nSection 12.

Such sum  \nshall be withheld until the subcontractor pre-  \nsents proof that it has paid the delinquent  \n46  \namount and the payment for the current  \nreporting period. It is understood and agreed  \nthat the Employer shal] only be obligated to  \nwithhold that amount of said delinquency that  \nwas incurred by said subcontractor as a sub-  \ncontractor of the Employer.
