### Trustees  
### 
The Board of Trustees is the sponsor of any Plan established pursuant to this Trust. The individual Trustees listed  
above, their successors, and any Administrator designated by the Trustees shall be, for purposes of ERISA, the named  
fiduciaries with respect to any such Plan.  
The Board of Trustees shall consist of six Trustees. The Contributing Employers, through the Painting and  
Decorating Contractors of America, Chapter No. 2, and the Union shall each designate three Trustees. The individual  
Trustees so designated shall collectively constitute the Board of Trustees.  
The Trustees are authorized to hire an Administrator and delegate to such Administrator such authority and  
responsibility as they determine to delegate and which may lawfully be delegated. The Trustees are further authorized  
to appoint one from their number to serve as Managing Trustee and to delegate to such Managing Trustee such  
authority and responsibility as they determine to delegate and which may lawfully be delegated. The Trustees may  
also establish committees or subcommittees composed of one or more Trustees to carry out any of their duties under  
this Trust, including the collection of employer contributions or other amounts due to the Trust.  
The Trustees shal! designate one Trustee as Chairman to serve for a term of one year, commencing with the date  
of election and until a successor Chairman is thereafter selected, for the purpose of presiding at the meetings of the  
Trustees. The Chairman shall initially be selected from the Trustees representing the Union, the following year from  
the Trustees representing the Employers, and thereafter similarly alternately selected.  
A quorum for the transaction of business shall consist of the presence at the meeting of at least four Trustees, two  
of whom represent the Employers and two of whom represent the Union. Decisions of the Trustees shall be made by  
majority vote. If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attends a meeting, the voting power of the group  
with fewer Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with more Trustees present so that there  
shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting.  
A deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever either of the following situations arises: (1) a proposal, nomination,  
motion, resolution, or other matter is voted upon, and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly divided;  
or (2) aquorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to  
—3—  
the inability to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the  
Union Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agreeing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by  
casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the inability  
of the Employer Trustees and Union Trustees to agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then an impartial  
umpire shall, on the petition of either the Employer Trustees or Union Trustees, be appointed by the Chief Judge of  
the United States District Court for the district wherein the principal office of the Trust is located. The decision of any  
such impartial umpire shal] be final and binding on the Trustees and all concermed.  
Either the Chairman or the Managing Trustee or any two Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees or direct the  
Administrator to call such a meeting at any time by giving at least five days’ written notice of the time and place thereof  
to each Trustee. Any meeting socalled may be postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee  
upon showing of justifiable cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice  
if all of the Trustees consent thereto or if all attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any  
proposition, no formal meeting thereon need be held by the Trustees. The Managing Trustee, in the written notice,  
shall notify the Trustees of the subjects to be discussed, but this shal! not be construed to limit any other subjects of  
discussion properly placed before the meeting.  
The Trustees may receive reimbursement for expenses property and actually incurred in the performance of their  
duties as Trustees when approved by the majority of the Trustees. Reasonable compensation may be paid to the  
Trustees for services rendered in the performance of their duties as Trustees, provided such payments are made in  
accordance with the Federal and State laws and regulations then in effect governing trusts. Additionally, the Trustees  
may receive reimbursement for expenses incurred in attending educational conferences, seminars, and meetings,  
provided that the Trustees determine in each case that the subject matter of the conference, seminar, or meeting is  
relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are reasonable.  
Any Trustee may resign by giving 30 days’ notice in the United States Mail to the other Trustees and to the Board  
of his intent to so resign. The Union may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by it by giving 30 days’ notice in  
the United States Mail to that Trustee, to the other Trustees, and to the Board of such intent to discharge. The Employers  
may discharge any Trustee appointed by them by giving 30 days’ notice in the United States Mail to that Trustee, to  
the other Trustees, and to the Board of such intent to discharge. The resignation or removal of a Trustee shall be  
automatic at the end of the 30-day period of notification either by che Trustee or by the Union or the Employers, as  
described above, of resignation or removal. In the event that any of the Trustees selected by the Union shall die, be  
incapable of acting hereunder, resign, or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Union  
and duly certified by the Board. In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Employers shall die, become incapable  
of acting hereunder, resign, or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Employers and  
duly certified by the Board. Failure of the Union or the Employers to select a successor Trustee promptly shall not  
prevent the remaining Trustees from carrying on the affairs of this Trust.  
The Unity Hall Corporation, the Union, and the Trustees of the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare, Pension,  
Group Insurance, Vacation, and Apprenticeship and Journeyman Training Trusts shall have no role whatsoever in the  
selection or removal of Employer Trustees.

2. Birth of a child of the Participant;  
3. Placement of a child with the Participant in connection with the adoption of such child by the  
Participant, or  
4. Caring for such child by the Participant.  
The amount of hours to be credited for the period of absence shall be the number of hours that normally  
would have been credited to the Participant, but for the absence from covered employment, if such an  
amount can be ascertained. If this amount is not able to be ascertained, the Participant shall be credited  
with eight hours of service for each working day during the leave. The hours for service shall be credited  
in the vesting computation year in which they occur, if the leave occurs totally within one vesting  
computation year. If the leave takes place in more than one vesting computation year, the hours of service  
shall be credited in the vesting year during which the absence begins, if the crediting is necessary to prevent  
a break in service; otherwise the hours of service shall be credited in the following vesting computation  
year.  
Hours of service under this subparagraph shall be computed only for purposes of determining whether a  
one-year break in service has occurred. Such hours will not be counted toward credited service nor will  
they be counted toward determining whether the Participant has completed a year of service for vesting  
purposes.  
The Participant is required to furnish, upon request by the Plan Administrator or an authorized  
representative thereof, such timely information as the Plan may reasonably require to establish that the  
absence was for one of the reasons stated in this subparagraph and/or to establish the number of days for  
which there was such an absence.  
E. Effective January 1, 1994, an hour of service for purposes of determining whether a Participant has  
completed a year of service for vesting purposes will include hours of service the Participant would have  
earned but for his having taken approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Such hours will  
not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual.  
Hours of Service shall be computed and credited in accordance with Department of Labor Regulations 2530.200b.

5.1 General Rules. This Article sets forth the rules for determining and computing the amount of a  
Participant’s accrued benefit under the Plan. The accumulation and retention of accrued benefit credits are subject  
to the requirements concerning Years of Vesting Service. The Benefit Amounts are subject to reduction on account  
of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VIII) and modification if the Participant retires with an annuity  
Starting date other than hts normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the normal form of benefits.  
Eligibility depends on meeting the conditions for benefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning  
Years of Vesting service and permanent break in service.  
5.2 Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of this Plan the norma} form of benefits is a life annuity, with a  
60 month guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting  
Date and continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his  
Annuity Starting Date, but before aJ] sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining  
payments shall be made to the named beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such beneficiary is not then surviving, to the  
contingent beneficiary, ifthen surviving. Ifno designated beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participant’s death,  
the remaining payments shall be made to the Participant’s estate. If a beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed  
payments dies before all guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the contingent beneficiary, if one  
is then surviving. If no contingent beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate  
of the beneficiary who last received a payment, until ali guaranteed payments have been made.  
The amount of benefit stated in the Plan (Section 5.3) is the amount which the Participant would receive each  
month, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, commencing at normal retirement date.  
In the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, or  
in the event the Participant begins to receive benefits at a time other than his normal retirement date, the monthly  
amount which the Participant will be entitled to receive will be different from the amount stated in this section. The  
amount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the  
—_§6 —  
   
actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month  
guarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.  
5.3 Amount of Benefit Stated in the Normal Benefit Form. The amount of benefit that a Participant accrues  
stated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement  
Date, is the sum of the amount determined under subsection 5.3A and the amount determined under Section 5.3B.  
A. The amount determined under this subsection (“accredited past service benefit”) is $2.50 for each year of  
accredited past service for any Participant who participated on and after July 1, 1964, but who commenced  
participation prior to July 1, 1965. An eligible Participant receives a year of accredited past service for  
each continuous year of service prior to July 1, 1965. No Participant who first participated in the Plan after  
July 1, 1965 shall be entitled to past service credits. The amount determined under this subsection is subject  
to the rules concerning permanent breaks in service.  
B. The amount determined under this subsection future service benefit’) is the sum of the  
amounts earned by the Participant under all applicable tables. Accredited future service benefit will be  
accrued under this subsection for each 12 consecutive month period commencing with July 1, 1964, and  
subsequent anniversaries thereof (“benefit accrual year”), based on the number of “hours of service”  
completed by the Participant during the particular benefit accrual year, subject to the following rules:  
1. Noaccredited future service benefit will be accrued by a Participant for any benefit accrual year during  
which the Participant fails to complete at least 400 hours of service.

In order to be entitled to receive benefits under this Plan, a Participant or Beneficiary must meet the requirements  
for one of the types of benefits described in this Article VI.  
6.1 Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while still an active  
Participant in the Plan (i.e. prior to his Participation ceasing within the meaning of Article III), the Participant shall  
be entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while not an active  
Participant, but has met one of the requirements of Article VII such that he has become vested in his accrued benefit,  
the Participant shall be entitled to a Normal] Retirement Benefit upon reaching his Normal Retirement Date.  
A Normal Retirement Benefit is paid in the form provided under Article VIII and is based on the Participant’s  
accrued benefit as computed under Article V, without reduction for early retirement.  
A Participant who has met the requirements for a Normal Retirement Benefit is entitled to begin to receive benefits  
as of his Normal Retirement Date without regard to whether he continues to work in covered employment and without  
regard to whether he is entitled to Social Security Benefits.  
In the event a Participant accrues additional accredited future service benefits for service after his Normal  
Retirement Annuity Starting Date, he shall be credited with such service. However, any Such additional accredited  
future service shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the actuarial value of any normal retirement benefits paid to  
the Participant subsequent to his Normal Retirement Date. Notwithstanding the reduction set forth in the previous  
sentence, a Participant who completes 1,200 or more hours of service in any Pian Year after his annuity Starting Date,  
shall accrue at least the benefit set forth in the following table:

Retirement Date, shall become payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of that benefit accrual  
year; the first payment shall include retroactive payments to and including the first payment due July 1. The  
Participant’s post normal retirement age election as to the form of benefits will apply to the additional accredited  
service accrued after his Normal Retirement Date.  
6.2 oned Retir Date. Subject to the requirements of subsection 9.4, a Participant who has met the  
requirements for a Normai Retirement Benefit may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date of his choice

his Annuity Starting Date and, if he knows, of his postponed Annuity Starting Date. The Participant shall, within a  
reasonable time of said notification, receive the notification described in subsection 8.4. The Participant’s election  
period for purposes of subsection 8.3, shall be the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the Participant’s  
elected Postponed Annuity Starting Date. In the event of a Postponed Annuity Starting Date, the amount of  
Participant’s monthly benefit shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the later commencement date. The actuarial  
adjustment for any additional accredited service which accrues for service after the Participant’s Normal Retirement  
Date shall run from the date that the benefits would have first been payable (i.e., September i following the end of  
the benefit accrual year in which the benefits accrued). In no event shall the Participant be permitted to postpone his  
Annuity Starting Date to a date after his “Required Beginning Date,” as defined in Section 9.4A.

Pictorial Painters Local Union 774 (the early retirement eligibility and benefit amount of these excluded  
Participants are to continue to be determined under subsection 6.3A).

b. Completion of ten (10) years of vesting service under the Plan, and  
c. Accrual of twenty-five (25) years of credited service, as defined herein. For purpose of this

purposes of this Section 6.3B2 includes any year of service within the geographic jurisdiction  
of Painters District Council No. 2, as it was constituted on July 1, 1988, under a collective  
bargaining agreement to which a union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Painters  
was a party.  
C. Except as specified in Section 8.2 below, the Early Retirement Benefit shal] be paid in the Normal Form  
of Benefits under the Plan (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee). The Participant may elect any  
Annuity Starting Date after the date of his election and after meeting the applicable eligibility requirements.  
. Retirement Benefit which the Participant will be entitled to receive each month, stated  
in the form of a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee will be the Participant’s Normal Benefit  
Amount, computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, reduced by of one percent  
(1/2 of 1%) for each full month that the Participant is younger than age 65 as of his Early Retirement  
Annuity Starting Date.  
For any such additional accredited future service, the Participant is entitled to elect Annuity Starting  
Date(s), and for each such election, the Participant will receive the notices and election options set forth  
in Article VIII. Likewise, the spousal consent requirements of Article VIIT will continue to apply to any  
such election. Notwithstanding the above, the first valid election of an Annuity Starting Date and Form  
of Benefits which the Participant makes after his Normal Retirement Age will govern all additional  
benefits accrued thereafter.  
Total and Permanent Disability Benefit.  
. A Participant who becomes totally and permanently disabled, while still a Participant in the Plan, and after  
the Participant has earned ten (10) years of vesting credit, may elect to receive the Total and Permanent  
Disability Benefits described in this Section.  
For purposes of this Article, participation ceases on the first day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year  
during which a Participant experiences a one year break in service as defined in Section 7.3A.  
For purposes of this Article, effective March 1, 1986, a Participant shall be deemed to be totally and  
permanently disabled only if he is determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Social Security  
Administration.  
The Benefit provided by this Article is not available to a former Participant whose participation ceased  
within the meaning of this Section, prior to his becoming disabled. The Benefit provided by this Article  
is not available to a Participant who the Trustees determine has become disabled while engaged in the  
commission of a felony or as a result of willful intention to injure himself or to induce an illness that could  
result in disability.  
B. Such Participant who shall be so certified as totally and permanently disabled shall be entitled to receive  
a monthly disability pension based on his accrued benefits (but in no event less than Twenty-five Dollars  
($25.00) per month), commencing with the month in which he is eligible to receive his first disability  
payment from the Social Security Administration and he shall continue to receive such disability pension  
until the earliest of death, recovery trom his total and permanent disability, the election of an Early  
Retirement Benefit, or attainment of Normal Retirement Age.  
Upon attaining Normal Retirement Age (or at Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date, if elected by the  
Participant), the Participant's Benefits shall convert to one of the forms of benefit payable for the Normal  
Retirement Benefit (or Early Retirement Benefit) and the Total and Permanent Disability Benefit shall  
cease. At that time the Participant shall receive the notices and elections that a Participant would receive  
at Normal Retirement Age. The monthly benefit after converting to Early or Normal  
Retirement Benefit will in no event be less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month.  
C. Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of a Participant who is otherwise eligible for any benefit under  
this Plan. Nor shall the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of retirement  
or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his beneficiary under other provisions of this Plan.  
A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the same retirement benefits  
(Preretirement Survivor Annuity, Early Retirement Benefit and Normal Retirement Benefit) in the same  
form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and election procedures as he would  
otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability benefits.  
6.5 Death Benefit. Effective March [, (986, in addition to the benefits otherwise provided by this Plan and  
Trust, the Plan and Trust shall pay a death benefit in the amount of $3,000 to the designated beneficiary of any  
Participant who has retired under this Plan on July 1, 1982 or thereafter, provided that the Participant was an active  
Participant at the time of his Annuity Starting Date. For purposes of this paragraph, the term retirement means that  
the Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Total and Permanent Disability  
Payment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not  
ceased under Article III.  
Effective with respect to Participants who die September ], 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the  
requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall  
not apply to any Participant who was employed by an employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and  
Pictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an hour of  
Service.  
Effective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the  
requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for Death Benefit only if the Participant  
was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan), acovered Participant for the Death Benefit under  
the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or on Waiver of Premium for Disability under the Painters District  
Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust.  
6.6 Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.  
A. General Rule. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to the  
surviving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22, 1984 but before his Annuity Starting Date,  
who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the date of  
death, and who had met one of the requirements of Article VII and was therefore vested as of the date of  
his death.  
B. Definition. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse  
of a Participant who meets the requirement of Section 6.6A, computed under Section 6.6C.  
lified Preretiremen rvivor Annuity.  
1. Ifa Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant,  
the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse 1s the  
amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant  
had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the Participant’s Death.  
—~13—  
2.  
If a Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant,  
the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the  
amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity, if the Participant  
had:  
a. Separated from service on the day he last worked in covered employment;  
b. Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant.  
c. Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and  
d. Died on the next day.  
Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse shall  
commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:  
a. The date of the Participant’s death, or  
b. The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;  
and shall] continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse dies.  
No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant’s spouse fails to survive to the date on  
which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under  
Section 6.7.  
Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to any  
date on or before the later of:  
a. The Participant’s Normal Retirement Date; or  
b. The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant’s 62nd birthday.  
In the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the  
amount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor  
annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before the  
deferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant’s spouse elects to defer the  
Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting Date, no  
survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section  
6.7.  
The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to the  
annuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed $3,500.  
For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan is  
required to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  
Corporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.  
6.7 Beneficiary Annuity.  
A. A Beneficiary Annuity, as defined in Section 6.7B shall be paid to the beneficiary determined under  
Section 6.7C of any Participant who meets either of the following eligibility requirements:  
1.  
Ds  
A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date but has not met the requirements for  
a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity; or  
A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified  
Preretirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse’s  
Annuity Starting Date under the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.  
—14—  
B. The Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable under the Normal Form |  
C.  
D.  
  
of Benefits (a life annuity with a60 month guarantee) commencing at the Participant’s Normal Retirement  
Date, provided, however, that this amount is payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries determined under  
Section 6.7C only for 60 months. Benefit payments to the beneficiary will commence with the first day  
of the first month following the month in which the Participant would have reached age 60 or if later, the  
first day of the month following the month in which the Participant dies.  
The beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same  
manner as the beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2.  
This Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or after January  
19, 1995,  

### ARTICLE VII  
### Vesting Requirement  
### 
General Ruje. A Participant meets the requirements of Article VH, and is therefore “vested” for purposes  
of eligibility for plan benefits, if he meets one of the following requircments:  
A.  
O  
7.2  
A Participant who has completed ten years of vesting service as defined in Section 7,2 (excluding years  
of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service) is vested;  
A Participant who has completed five years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years  
of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service) and whose participation ceases within the meaning  
of Article III after the Participant has reached the age of forty-five (45) is vested.  
A Participant whose termination of participation within the meaning of Article III occurs after the  
Participant has reached the age of sixty (60) is vested.  
For any Participant who has one hour of service on or after July 1, 1989 and who is not a Participant as  
a result of being covered under a collective bargaining agreement, that Participant is vested if he has  
completed five (5) years of vesting service (excluding years of vesting service prior to a permanent break  
in service).  
ear of Vesti rvice.  
The vesting computation period is the twelve month period commencing July | of each year and ending  
June 30 of the following year.  
A Participant whose Participation ceased (within the meaning of Article ITI) on or after January J, 1976,  
earns a year of vesting service for any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting  
computation period which ended June 30, 1992, during which the Participant one hour of  
service, as defined in Section 1.19.  
For each vesting computation period commencing with the vesting computation period that begins July  
1, 1992, a Participantearms a year of vesting service foreach such vesting computation period during which  
the Participant completed 400 or more hours of service as defined in Section 1.19.  
Years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service (as defined in Section 7.3D) are forfeited  
and do not count toward years of vesting service,  
A Participant who ceased participation prior to December 1, 1974, will be deemed to have completed 10  
years of vesting service (or 5 years of vesting service if applicable) only if the Participant completes said  
years of vesting service in accordance with the rules contained in this Section 7.2 and if the date of the  
—15—  
7.3  
8.1  
cessation of participation is after the tenth anniversary (or if applicable, the fifth anniversary)  
of the date that the Participant first participated.  
For purposes of computing years of service for vesting only, hours of service with a Contributing Employer  
for which the Employer is not obligated to contribute to this Trust shall be counted provided that such  
noncovered service is contiguous with the Participant's service for which contributions were required.  
Noncovered service shail be considered as contiguous with covered service if there is no intervening quit,  
discharge or other termination. No benefits are accrued for contiguous noncovered service.  
A one year break in service occurs when, during any vesting computation period up to and including the  
vesting computation period that ended on June 30, 1992, a Participant has no hours of service. For vesting  
computation period beginning with the vesting computation period that begins on July 1, 1992 and  
thereafter, a one year break in service occurs when, during any such vesting computation period, a  
Participant or former Participant completes less than 400 hours of service.  
A Participant who experiences a one year break in service after he has become vested within the méaning  
of 7.1, is entitled to have his pre-break service counted for vesting and benefit accrual purposes.  
A Participant who experiences a one year break in service prior to becoming vested and who subsequently  
becomes a Participant in the Plan shall be entitled to have his years of vesting service and his years of  
accredited service for purposes of benefit computation prior to that one year break in service counted  
unless the break in service is a “permanent break in service” within the meaning of the following Section  
7.3D. Conversely, years of service prior to a permanent break in service will not be counted.  
A Permanent Break in Service occurs if a nonvested Participant experiences consecutive one year breaks  
in service which equal or exceed, the greater of:  
1. five years of service;  
2. the number of the Participant’s years of service before the break in service.  

### ARTICLE VIII  
### Forms of Benefit Payments  
### 
Definjtions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this Article VIEL.  
The term “Annuity Starting Date” shall have the meaning set out in Section 1.24.  
A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who has been married to his spouse for at least  
one year immediately prior to his Annuity Starting Date is a form of annuity which pays a lifetime monthly  
pension payment to the Participant and upon the Participant’s death, pays one-half of that amount in  
monthly payments to the Participant’s “surviving spouse” for the life of the surviving spouse. The  
Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for a married Participant will be the actuarial equivalent of the  
amount which the Participant would receive under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan. The  
monthly amount of the Participant’s pension is reduced in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used  
by the Plan and the ages of the Participant and his spouse.  
A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who has not been married for one year  
immediately prior to his Annuity Starting Date is a life annuity. This annuity shall be the actuarial  
equivalent of the benefit which the Participant would have received under the Normal Form of Benefits  
under this Plan.  
— 16—  
C. The “surviving spouse” for purposes of this Article is the spouse to whom the Participant was lawfully  
8.2  
married as of the Annuity Starting Date. If the “surviving spouse” predeceases the Participant, no  
survivorship annuity will be payable, even if the Participant remarries. The death of the surviving spouse  
prior to the Participant’s death will not affect the amount of the monthly payment to the Participant.  
General Rule Concerning Form of Benefits. Effective for any Participant whose Annuity Starting Date  
is July 1, 1976, or thereafter, benefits shall be paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity unless the  
Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3.  
A Participant who was married as of his Annuity Starting Date, but has been married less than a year, will have his  
benefits converted to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for a married Participant on the one year anniversary  
of his marriage, if his spouse and the Participant are still surviving, unless the Participant validly waives the Qualified  
Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3.  
8.3  
A,  
Waiver of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.  
A Participant who is otherwise required to receive his benefits in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor  
Annuity may waive said form of benefits by filing with the Fund Office a valid waiver during the election  
period. The election period is the ninety (90) day period prior to the Annuity Starting Date. Any valid  
election made during an election period prior to an Annuity Starting Date which is on or after the  
Participant’s Normal! Retirement Age will govern all payments of benefits earned thereafter. Any election  
may be revoked at any time during the election period.  
In order to be valid, an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity must meet the following  
requirements:  
t. It must be in writing.  
2. It must be filed no less than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days after the Participant  
receives the Notice and Explanation described in Section 8.4. The Notice and Explanation is  
presumed to be received on the third day after the date it is mailed.  
3. Inthe case of a Participant who has had one or more hours of service after August 23, 1984, the waiver  
must be consented to in writing by the Participant’s spouse (unless such consent is not required under  
subsection 8.3B4). Said consent must also acknowledge in writing the effect of the election. The  
consent and acknowledgment required by this subsection must be witnessed by a notary public or a  
plan representative.  
Effective for any election filed with regard to an Annuity Starting Date on or after July 1, 1987, the  
waiver and consent must name the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, who will receive  
survivorship benefits under the Plan and must name the form of benefits to be paid under the Plan,  
(subject to the following paragraph). If a consent names a designated beneficiary and/or a specific  
form of benefits, then any subsequent change to said designated beneficiary and/or form of benefits  
is invalid unless a new consent is obtained from the spouse, which meets the requirements of this  
Section 8.3.  
If the consent does not name a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries or a specific form of benefits, or  
if the Participant and spouse desire that future changes in the beneficiary and/or form of benefits may  
be made without spousal consent. the consent must acknowledge that the spouse has the right to limit  
consent to a Specific beneficiary and a specific form of benefits and the consent must voluntarily waive  
whichever (or both) of said rights, in accordance with the desires of the Participant and his spouse.  
4, Theconsent described in this Section 8.3 is not required if it is established to the satisfaction of a plan  
representative that the consent otherwise required cannot be obtained because:  
a. there is no spouse:  
b. the spouse cannot be located; or 7  
c. such exist as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury as sufficient  
to obviate the requirement of the spousal consent.  
   
A. Within a reasonable time prior to the Annuity Starting Date, the Plan must provide the Participant with a  
notice in writing explaining the terms of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the right to waive  
that Annuity Form of Benefit. This Notice will be provided within a reasonable period of time before the  
Normal Retirement Age and a reasonable penod of time before any Early Retirement Date  
or Postponed Retirement Date. A Participant may not elect an Annuity Starting Date at any time before  
the 31st day after he has received the Notice.  
B. The Notice and Explanation must contain a written explanation of the following:  
1. The terms and conditions of the Qualifted Joint and Survivor Annuity;  
2. The Participant’s night to make an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the  
procedure for making the election;  
3. The effect of an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor form of benefit;  
4, The rights of the Participant’s spouse, including the right to withhold consent; and  
5. The right to revoke an election to waive Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the effect of such  
or revocation.  
8.5 Optional Forms of Retirement Benefits.  
A. Inthe event a Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, he may elect to receive  
his benefits in any of the following optional forms:  
1. Life Annuity with a 60 month guarantee (described in Section 5.2 of this Plan).  
2. ALife Annuity with 120 month guarantee, whichis the same form of payments as the life annuity with  
60 month guarantee as described in Section 5.2, but the number of guaranteed payments is 120. This  
option may only be selected if the 120 monthly payments will not extend payments beyond the life  
expectancy of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.  
3. ALife Only Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant for his lifetime with  
no further payments after the monthly payment for the month in which the Participant dies.  
4. A Joint and Full Survivor Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant  
throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments in the same amount to the  
“surviving spouse”.  
5. A Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity, which provides monthly benefit payments to the  
Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payment equal to 66-2/3%  
of the amount that the Participant was receiving, to the “surviving spouse”.  
B. All optional forms of benefits (including the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity) shall be adjusted so  
that the actuarial value of the benefit is the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’s accrued benefit stated  
in the Normal Form of Benefit (Section 5.2). Under this Plan, actuarial equivalent means that whenever  
it is necessary to convert one form of annuity to another form of annuity or to a lump sum, the result wil!  
be benefits substantially equal in value as determined by application of the 1971 Male Group Annuity  
Monthly tables and a 6-1/2% interest rate.  
—  
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustees shall distribute the Participant’s benefits or the Beneficiary's  
benefits in the form of a lump sum payment on or prior to the annuity starting date if the present value of  
the benefits does not exceed $3,500. For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the  
date of distribution, the Plan shall use the interest rate established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  
Corporation as of the beginning of the Plan Year for valuing a lump sum distribution upon plan termination  
or individual termination. This section shall not apply after the Annuity Starting Date unless the  
Participant or Beneficiary consents in writing to the single sum distribution.  

### ARTICLE IX  
### Application for Timing of Benefit Distribution  
### 
9.1 Applications. A Participant or Beneficiary must apply in writing for any benefit payable under this Plan  
in a timely manner, in advance of the Annuity Starting Date. To be timely for this purpose, an application must be  
sufficient to give notice to the Trustees of the applicant’s request to commence receipt of benefits under this Plan.  
Every Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner shal] furnish, at the request of the Trustees, any information or proof  
reasonably required to determine his benefit nghts. If a person makes a willfully false statement material to an  
apphcation or furnishes fraudulent information or proof, benefits not vested under this Plan (as defined in Article VII)  
may be denied, suspended or discontinued as determined by the Trustees. The Trustees shall have the right to recover  
any benefit payments made in reliance on any false or fraudulent statement, information or proof submitted by a  
Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner.  
9.2 Trustees. The Trustees shal}, subject to the requirements of the Jaw, be the sole judges of the standard of  
proof required in any case and the application and interpretation of the Plan including decisions concerning the  
eligibility of a Participant or Beneficiary to participate or his entitlement to benefits, and decisions of the Trustees shall  
be final and binding on all parties. In the event an application for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the Participant  
or Beneficiary must follow the Benefit Claim Procedure set forth in Article X. Wherever in the Plan the Trustees are  
given discretionary powers, the Trustees shail exercise such powers in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.

April { of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Participant attains  
age 70-1/2 or the calendar year in which he ceases working in covered employment. If a Participant  
owns 5% or more of the stock of a Contributing Employer, the benefit must begin no later than April

the “required beginning date.”  
Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to the contrary, benefit payment must meet the requirements  
of either of the following subsections:

Participant and the Participant’s spouse). Distributions (as described in this subsection) may be  
made to a Participant and a nonspouse Beneficiary provided the period used to determine the “life  
expectancies” remains as that of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse.  
If distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with the provisions of subsection 9.4B 2a, and  
if the Participant dies before his or her entire interest is distnbuted, the remaining portion of the  
Participant’s interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution method being

designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of  
such beneficiary); and  
(c) such distributions begin not later than one year after the Participant’s death or such  
later date as may be prescribed by regulations.  
(2) If the designated beneficiary referred to in paragraph 9.4B2c(1) is the surviving spouse of  
the Participant, then:  
(a) the date on which distributions are required to begin under 9.4B2c(1)(c) shal! not be  
earlier than the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70-1/2; and ,

will be provided upon request to the Fund Office. The Plan Administrator shall furnish the claimant with a written  
notice of his decision within ninety (90) days after receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances require an  
extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension of time for processing the claim is required, written  
notice of the extension shall be furnished to the claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 90 day period. In no event  
shall such an extension exceed a period of 90 days after the expiration of the initial 90 day period.

the limitations set forth in subsections B1 and 2 of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the  
numerator of which is the number of the Participant’s such years of service and the denominator of which  
is 10.  
D. The following additional rules apply for plan years beginning July I, 1983 to July 1, 1986, inclusive: in  
the case of a Participant whose benefits hereunder commence prior to his attainment of age 62, the  
limitation set forth in subsection A] of this section shall, in accordance with the regulations issued by the

E. Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection A of this section, if a Participant was covered by the Plan  
before the first day of the Limitation Year beginning in 1983, he may receive an annual retirement benefit  
which is not less than the amount of his current accrued benefit as of the close of the last Limitation Year  
beginning before 1983, as determined under the terms of the Plan as then in effect disregarding any  
amendments or cost of living adjustments after July 1, 1982. For purposes of this Section, the term  
“Limitation Year” shall mean the Plan Credit Year.

Starting Date ts after Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000 limitation contained in Section 11.1A1  
shall be actuarially increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of $90,000  
commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age.  
If a Participant covered by this Plan participates in both Defined Benefit and Defined Contributions Plans  
maintained by the Employer, the sum of 1 and 2 below may. not exceed 1.0:  
I,

the Employer determined as of the close of the Limitation Year, divided by the lesser of:  
a. The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of  
the Internal Revenue Code for such year, or  
b. The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Section  
415(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to such Employee for such year.  
The sum of the annual additions to the Employee’s account under all defined contributions plans of  
the Employer as of the close of the Limitation Year and for all prior Calendar Years divided by the  
sum of the lesser of a or b for such year and foreach prior year of service with the Employer (regardless  
of whether any such defined contribution plan was in existence during those years), where;  
a. Is the product of !.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(c)(1)(A) of  
the Internal Revenue Code for such year (without regard to Section 415 (c)(6) of such Code); and  
b. Is the product of 1.4 multiplied by the same amount which may be taken into account under  
Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Interna] Revenue Code (or Section 415(c)(7) of such Code, if  
applicable) with respect to such individual under such plan for such year; provided however, that  
the Board of Trustees may elect that the amount taken into account for each Employee for all  
years ending before January I, 1983, under a and b above shall be determined pursuant to the  
special transition rule in such Section 415(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.  
If this Plan is aggregated with another Plan that was in existence on July 1, 1982, and the above  
limitations are not met, each Participant for whom the limits are violated will not receive any annual  
additions or accruals in this Plan. In the event that at the earlier to occur of each December 31 or the  
date of an Employee retirement or termination, the sum of 1 and 2 above exceeds 1.0 and the benefit  
of such Employee under such other Plan or Plans 1s not reduced to bring such sum to 1.0, then such  
Employee’s benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the sum of 1  
and 2 above for each Employee to equal 1.0.

plus  
(2) the amount of the Participant’s benefit accrued on or after July 1, 1994, under Article V,  
taking into account only years of service after June 30, 1994, and

B. Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.  
Effective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:  
l.  
This Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Credit Year commencing after December 31, 1983,  
in which, as of the Determination Date,  
a. the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees and  
b. the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an  
Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and the  
aggregate accounts of all Key Employees and non-Key Employees under this Plan and all plans  
of an Aggregation Group.  
If any participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key  
Employee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant’s present value of accrued benefits  
and/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining  
whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this  
Plan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31,  
1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer  
maintaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date,  
the aggregate account and/or present value of accrued benefit for such Participant or former  
Participant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is  
a Top-Heavy Plan.  
A Participant’s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under applicable  
provisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.  
“Ageregation Group” means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation

Key Employee is a Participant, and each other plan of an Employer which enables any plan in  
which a Key Employee participates to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of  
the Internal Revenue Code, will be required to be aggregated. Such group shall be known as a  
“Required Aggregation Group.”  
In the case of a Required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a Top-  
Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Required  
Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group Is not a Top-Heavy  
Plan.  
b. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required  
Aggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the  
provisions of Section 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such group shall be  
known as a “Permissive Aggregation Group.”  
In the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required  
Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group  
is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group wil! be considered a Top-  
Heavy Pian if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.  
— 26 —  
¢. Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan  
Credit Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.  
4. In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant’s present value of accrued benefits shall be  
determined:  
a. as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within a  
twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;  
b. for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:  
the Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or  
the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account the  
estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.  
c. forany other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation  
date,  
d. the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit plan  
minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan Credit Year.  
5. The calculation of a Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date shall  
be the sum of the following:  
a. the present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent  
valuation;  
b. any Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date or  
within four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after the  
valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  
distributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already included  
in the Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions made  
pnorto July J, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated  
would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;  
c. any Employce contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts attributable  
to tax deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be considered to be a  
part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits;  
d. with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the  
Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another  
Employer), if this Plan provides for ro!lovers or plan-to-pian transfers, it shall always consider  
such rollover or plan-to-pian transfers as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan  
is the pan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-pian transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers  
or plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant’s present value  
of accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted prior to July 1, 1984,  
shall be considered as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits; and  
e. with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the  
Employee or made to a pian maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover  
or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this section. If  
this the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover  
or plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits, irrespective  
of the date on which such rollover Of transfer is accepted.  
f. “Top-Heavy Group” means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date, the  
sum of:  
(1) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans  
included in the group; and  
(2) the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included in  
the group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all Participants.  
g. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for herein  
for the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan Credit Years  
beginning after December 31, 1983) shail be extended in accordance with any federal law or  
regulatory authority.  
C. Top-Heavy Vesting.  
1. Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan for any  
Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant’s accrued benefit shall be  
determined on the basis of the Participant’s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the  
following schedule:  
Service for Vesting  
(excluding Years of Service for Vesting  
prior to effective date of this Plan) Vested percentage  
I year 0%  
2 years 0%  
3 years 100%  
2. If, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may elect  
to:  
a. continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant’s  
accrued benefit; or  
b. revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to  
Section 411(a)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued  
benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and any  
Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of remaining  
under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a Plan amendment.  
3. The Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Employee who does not  
have one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee’s  
accrued benefit attributable to Emptoyer contributions will be determined without regard to this  
Article.  
D. Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.  
1, The minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this section  
for each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product of:  
a. one-twelfth (1/12th) of Annual Compensation averaged over the five consecutive “limitation  
years” (or actual number of “limitation years” if less) which produces the highest average, and  
b. the lesser of  
— 28 —  
(1) two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or  
(2) twenty percent (20%).  
For purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code, a  
Non-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:  
a. his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or  
b. he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan will be considered to be a Participant.  
For purposes of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July  
1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  
disregarded.  
For purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any “limitation year” ending prior to July 1,  
1984, or subsequent to the last “limitation year” during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan shall be  
disregarded. The term “limitation year” means the Plan Credit Year.  
If the Plan provides for the normal retirement benefit to be paid in a form other than a single life  
annuity, the accrued benefit under this section shali be the Actuarial Equivalence of the minimum  
accrued benefit under Article V.  
If payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement Age,  
the minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.  
if aNon-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included ina Required  
Aggregation Group which is Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under this Plan.  
To the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VU of the Plan the minimum accrued benefit  
under this section may not be forfeited under Sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 41 1(a)(3)(D) of the Internal  
Revenue Code.

to any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust, provided that  
the Trustees may adopt an amendment  
A. necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plan or the Trust Fund under the Internal  
Revenue Code and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or

beginning of the three year period ending on the termination date of the Plan, to each pension,  
based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date)  
under which such pension would be the least. The lowest pension in pay status during the three  
year period shall be considered the pension in pay status for such period.  
b. In the case of a pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which would have been in pay status as  
of the beginning of such three year period if the Participant had retired prior to the beginning of  
the three year period if his pension had commenced (in the standard form) as of the beginning  
of such period, to each such pension based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the  
five year period eriding on such date) under which the pension would be the least.

the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.  
This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph B3 are not sufficient to  
satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.  
a. Ifthis paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph b below, the assets shall be allocated  
to the benefits of individuals described in paragraph B3 on the basis of the benefits of individuals

beginning of the five year period ending on the date of the Plan termination.  
b. If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph a above, are sufficient to satisfy in full  
the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for  
purposes of subparagraph a, benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be  
determined on the basis of the Plan as amended by the most recent amendment effective during

Accrual of t  
5.1 This Article sets forth the rules for determining and computing the amount of a Participant’s  
accrued benefit under the Plan. The accumulation and retention of accrued benefit credits are subject to the  
requirements concerning Years of Vesting Service and Breaks in Service. The Benefit Amounts are subject to  
reduction on account of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VJ) and modification if the Participant  
retires with an annuity starting date other than his normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the  
normal form of benefits.  
Eligibility to receive a benefit based on the Participant’s accrued benefit depends on mecting the conditions for  
benefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning Years of Vesting Service and Permanent Break in  
Service (Article VID.  
5.2 Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of thts Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a 60  
month guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting Date  
and continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his Annuity  
Starting Date, but before all sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining payments shall  
be made to the named beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such beneficiary is not then surviving, to the contingent  
bencficiarey, if then surviving. Jf no designated beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participant’s death, the  
remaining payments shall be made to the Participant’s cstate. If a beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed payments  
dies before all guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the contingent beneficiary, if one is then  
surviving. If no contingent beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate of the  
beneficiary who last received a payment, unt! all guaranteed payments have been made.  
The amount of benefit stated in the Plan (Section 5.3) is the amount which the Participant would receive each  
month, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, commencing at normal retirement date.  
In the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, or  
in the event the Participant begins to receive at a time other than his normal retirement date, the monthly  
amount which the Participant will be entitled to receive will be different from the amount stated in this section. The  
amount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the  
actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month  
guarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.  
5.3. Amount of Benefit Stated in the Normal Benefit Form, The amount of benefit that a Participant accrues  
stated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement  
Date, is the sum of the amount determined under subsection §.3A and the amount determined under Section 5.3B.  
A. The amount determined under this subsection (“accredited past service benefit’) is $2.50 for cach year of  
accredited past service for any Participant who participated on and after July 1, 1964. An eligible  
Participant receives a year of accredited past service for each continuous year of service prior to July 1,  
1964. No Participant who first participated in the Plan after July t, 1964 shall be entitled to past service  
credits. The amount determined under this subsection is subject to the rules concerning permanent breaks  
in Service.  
B. determined under this subsection (“accredited future service benefit”) is the sum of the amounts  
eamed by the Participant under all applicable tables. Accredited future service benefit will be accrued under  
this subsection for each 12 consecutive month period commencing with July 1, 1964, and subsequent

benefit increased by the greater of five percent (5%) of the monthly payment or Ten Dollars ($10.00).  

### ARTICLE VI  
### 
onditions for Benefit Entitleme of Benefits  
In order to be entitled to received benefits under this Plan, a Participant or Beneficiary must meet the  
requirements for one of the types of benefits described in this Article VI.  
6.1 Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while still an active  
Participant in the Plan (i.c. prior to his Participation ceasing within the meaning of Article IH), the Participant shall  
be entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while not an active  
Participant, but has met one of the requirements of Article VIE such that he has become vested in his accrued benefit,  
the Participant shall be entitled to a Normal] Retirement Benefit upon reaching his Normal Retirement Date.  
—9—  
A Normal Retirement Benefit 1s paid in the form provided under Article VIII and is based on the Participant’s  
accrued benefit as computed under Article V, without reduction for early retirement.  
A participant who has met the requirements for a Normal] Retirement Benefit is entitled to begin to receive  
benefits as of his Norma] Retirement Date without regard to whether he continues 10 work in covered employment  
and without regard to whether he is entitled to Social Security Bencfits.  
In the event a Participant accrues additional accredited future service benefits for service after his Normal  
Retirement Annuity Starting Date, he shal] be credited with such service. However, any such additional accredited  
future service shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the actuarial value of any normal retirement benefits paid to  
the Participant subsequent to his Normal Retirement Date. Notwithstanding the reduction set forth in the previous  
sentence, a Participant who completes 1,200 or more hours of service in any Plan Year after his Annuity Starting  
Date, commencing with the Plan Year beginning July 1, 1994, shall accrue at least the benefit set forth in the  
following table:

Additional accredited future service earned in any benefit accrual year for service after the Participant’s Normal  
Retirement Date, shall become payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of that benefit accrual  
year; the first payment shall include retroactive payments to and including the first payment due July !. The Participant’s  
post Normal Retirement Age clection as to the form of benefits will apply to the additional accredited service  
accrued after his Normal Retirement Date.  
6.2 Postponed Retirement Date, Subject to the requirements of subsection 9.4, a Participant who has met the  
requirements for a Normal Retirement Benefit may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date of his  
choice after his Normal Retirement Date. In such event, the Participant shalt notify the Fund Office of his intent to  
postpone his Annuity Starting Date and, if he knows, of his postponed Annuity Starting Date. The Participant shall,  
within a reasonable time of said notification, receive the notification described in subsection 8.4. The Participant’s  
election period for purposes of subsection 8.3, shall be the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the  
Participant’s elected Postponed Annuity Starting Date. In the event of a Postponed Annuity Starting Date, the amount  
of Participant’s monthly benefit shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the later commencement datc. The actuarial  
adjustment for any additional accredited service which accrues for service after the Participant’s Normal Retirement  
Date shall run from the date that the benefits would have first been payable (i.e., September | following the end of  
the bencfit accrual year in which the benefits accrued). In no event shali the Participant be permitted to postpone his  
Annuity Starting Date to a date after his “Required Beginning Date,” as defined in Section 9.4A.

subsections.  
—i1—  
D. Except as specified in Section 8.2 below, the Early Retirement Benefit shall be paid in the Normal  
Form of Benefits under the Plan (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee). The Participant may elect  
any Annuity Starting Date after the date of his election and after meeting the applicable eligibility  
requirements.  
The amount of Early Retirement Benefit which the Participant will be entitled to receive each month,  
stated in the form of a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee will be the Participant’s Normal  
Benefit Amount, computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, reduced by one-half of  
one percent (1/2 of 1%) for each full month that the Participant ts younger than age 65 as of his Early  
Retirement Annuity Starting Date.  
For any additional accredited future service which the Participant accrues after his Early Retirement  
Annuity Starting Date, the Participant is entitled to elect Annuity Starting Date(s), and for each such  
election, the Participant will receive the notices and election options set forth in Article VIII. Likewise,  
the spousal consent requirements of Article VIII will continue to apply to any such election.  
Notwithstanding the above, the first valid election of an Annuity Starting Date and Form of Benefits  
which the Participant makes on or after his Normal Retirement Date will govern all additional benefits  
accrued thereafter.  
6.4 Tota] and Permanent Disability Benefit.  
A.  
A Participant who becomes totally and permanently disabled, while still a Participant in the Plan, and  
after the Participant has earned ten (10) years of vesting credit, may elect to receive the Total and  
Permanent Disability Benefits described in this Section.  
For purposes of this Article, participation ceases on the first day of the Plan Year following the Plan  
Year during which a Participant experiences a one year break in service as defined in Section 7.3A.  
For purposes of this Article, effective March I, 1986, a Participant shall be deemed to be totally and  
permanently disabled only if he is determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Social  
Security Administration.  
The Benefit provided by this Article is not available to a former Participant whose participation ceased  
within the meaning of this Section, prior to his becoming disabled. The Benefit provided by this  
Article is not available to a Participant who the Trustees determine has become disabled while en-  
gaged in the commission of a felony or as a result of willful intention to injure himsclf or to induce an  
illness that could result in disability.  
Such Participant who shall be so certified as totally and permanently disabled shall be entitled to  
receive a monthly disability pension in the amount of his accrued benefit stated in the Normal Form of  
Benefits (but in no event less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month), commencing with the  
month in which he is eligible to receive his first disability payment from the Social Security  
Administration and he shall continue to receive such disability pension until the earliest of death,  
recovery from his total and permanent disability, the election of an Early Retirement Benefit, or  
attainment of Normal Retirement Age.  
Upon attaining Normal Retirement Age (or at Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date, if elected by  
the Participant), the Participant’s Benefits shall convert to one of the forms of benefit payable for the  
Normal Retirement Benefit (or Early Retirement Benefit) and the Total and Permanent Disability  
Benefit shall cease. At that time the Participant shall receive the notices and elections that a Participant  
would receive at Normal Retirement Age. The Participant’s monthly benefit after converting to Early  
or Normal! Retirement Benefit will in no event be less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month.  
Nothing in this Section shall affect the nght of a Participant who ts otherwise eligible for any benefit  
under this Plan. Nor shail the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of  
retirement or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his beneficiary under other  
provisions of this Plan. A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the  
same retirement benefits (Preretirement Survivor Annuity, Early Retirement Benefit and Normal  
Retirement Benefit) in the same form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and  
election procedures as he would otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability  
benefits.  
—12—  
6.5 Death Benefit. Effective March 1, 1986, in addition to the benefits otherwise provided by this Plan and  
Trust, the Plan and Trust shall pay a death benefit in the amount of $3,000 to the designated beneficiary of any  
Participant who has retired under this Plan on July 1, 1982 or thereafter, provided the Participant was an active  
Participant at the time of his Annuity Starting Date. For purposes of this paragraph, the term retirement means that  
the Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Total and Permanent Disability  
Payment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not  
ceased under Article III.  
Effective with respect to Participants who die September 1, 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the re-  
quirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall  
not apply to any Participant who was employed by an employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and  
Pictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an hour of  
service.  
Effective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the re-  
quirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for Death Benefit only if the Partici-  
pant was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan) a covered Participant for the Death  
Benefit under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or on Waiver of Premium for Disability under the  
Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust. For  
purposes of the death benefit for deaths that occur on or after October 1, 1991, it is no longer required that the  
Participant shall have been an active Participant in the Painters District Council Pension Plan at the time of his  
Annuity Starting Date.  
6.6 Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity,  
A. General Rule, A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to  
the surviving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22, 1984 but before his Annuity Starting  
Date, who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the  
date of death, and who has met one of the requirements of Article VII and was therefore vested as of  
the date of his death.  
B. Definition, A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse  
of a Participant who meets the requirements of Section 6.6A computed under Section 6.6C.  
Cc C utation of Oualified Preretirement Survivor Annuit  
1. If a Participant dics after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that  
Participant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving  
spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity  
if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the  
Participant’s death. If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date  
under subsection 6.6C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shalf be computed under that  
subsection.  
2. Ifa Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Partici-  
pant, the amount of the Qualified Prerctirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving  
spouse is the amount which would be payable to the surviving spouse as a suvivor annuity, if the  
Participant had:  
a. Separated from service on the day he fast worked in covered employment;  
b. Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;  
c. Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and  
d. Died on the next day.  
If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under subsection 6.6C.4,  
the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.  
—13—  
   
6.7  
A.  
B.  
C.  
3. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse  
shall-commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:  
a. The date of the Participant’s death, or  
b. The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applics to that Participant;  
and shall continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse  
dies. No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant’s spouse fails to survive to the  
date on which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable  
under Section 6.7.  
4, Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to  
any date on or before the later of:  
a. The Participant’s Normal Retirement Date; or  
b. The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant’s 62nd birthday.  
In the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the  
amount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor  
annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before  
the deferred Annuity Starttng Date and died the next day. If the Participant’s spouse clects ta defer  
the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting  
Date, no survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such cvent, benefits may be payable  
under Section 6.7.  
5. The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to  
the annuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed  
$5,000.  
For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan  
is required to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty  
Corporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.  
Beneficia nnuit  
A Beneficiary Annuity, as defined in subsection 6.7B shall be paid to the beneficiary determined under  
subsection 6.7C of any Participant who meets either of the fotlowing eligibility requirements:  
1. A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date but has not met the requirements  
for a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity; or  
2. A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified  
Preretirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse’s  
Annuity Starting Date under the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.  
The Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable under the Normal  
Form of Benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at the Participant’s Normal  
Retirement Date, provided, however, that this amount is payable to the beneficiary or  
determined under Section 6.7C only for 60 months. Bencfit payments to the benficiary will  
commence with the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participant would  
have reached age 60 or if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant  
dies or if later, the first day of the month following the death of the surviving spouse.  
The beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same  
manner as the beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2, except that if payment is required to be  
made under that section to the Participant’s estate and if more than one year has passed since the  
participant’s death, the payments shall be made to the Particitpant’s legal heirs determined under the  
laws of intestacy of the State of Missouri as of the date the payments are to commence.  
This Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or before

### ARTICLE VII  
### Vesting Requirements  
### 
7.1. General Rule, A Participant meets the requirements of Article VI, and is therefore “vested” for purposes  
of eligibility for plan benefits, if he meets one of the following requirements:  
A.  
B.  
A Participant who has completed ten years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding  
years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service) is vested;  
A Participant who has completed five years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding  
years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service) and whose participation ceases within  
the meaning of Article III after the Participant has reached the age of forty-five (45) is vested.  
A Participant whose termination of participation within the meaning of Article IIT occurs after the  
Participant has reached the age of sixty (60) is vested.  
For any Participant who has one hour of service on or after July 1, 1989 and who is not a Participant  
as a result of being covered under a collective bargaining agreement, that Participant is vested if he  
has completed five (5) years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years of vesting  
service prior to a permanent break in service).  
Any Participant who has one hour of service on or after July I, 1998, is vested if he had completed five  
(5) years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years of service prior to a permanent  
break in service),  
Year of Vesting Service.  
The vesting computation period is the twelve month period commencing July 1 of each year and  
ending June 30 of the following year.  
A Participant whose participation ceased (within the meaning of Article IIE) on or after January 1,  
1976, earns a year of vesting service for any vesting computation period up to and including the  
vesting computation period which ended Junc 30, 1992, during which the Participant completed one  
hour of service, as defined in Section 1.19.  
For each vesting computation period commencing with the vesting computation penod that begins  
July 1, 1992, a Participant carns a year of vesting service for each such vesting computation period  
during which the Participant completed 400 or more hours of service as defined in Section 1.19.  
Years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service (as defined in Section 7.3D) are forfeited  
and do not count toward years of vesting service.  
A Participant who ceased participation prior to December 1, 1974, will be deemed to have completed  
10 years of vesting service (or 5 years of vesting service if applicable) only if the Participant  
completes said years of vesting service in accordance with the rules contained in this Section 7.2 and  
if the date of the Participant’s cessation of participation is after the tenth anniversary (or if applicable,  
the fifth anniversary) of the date that the Participant first participated.  
For purposes of computing years of service for vesting only, hours of service with a Contributing  
Employer for which the Employer is not obligated to contribute to this Trust shall be counted provided  
that such noncovered service ts contiguous with the Participant’s service for which contributions were  
required. Noncovered service shal! be considered as contiguous with covered service if there is no  
intervening quit, discharge or other termination. No benefits are accrued for contiguous noncovered  
service.  
Break-in-Service.  
A one year break in service occurs when, during any vesting computation period up to and including  
the vesting computation period that ended on June 30, 1992, a Participant has no hours of service, as  
defined in Section 1.19, For vesting computation periods beginning with the vesting computation  
period that begins on July 1, 1992, and thereafter, a one year break in service occurs when, during any  
such vesting computation period, a Participant or former Participant completes Jess than 400 hours of  
service, as defined in Section 1.19.  
A Participant who experiences a one year break in service after he has become vested within the  
meaning of Section 7.1, is entitled to have his pre-break service counted for vesting and benefit  
accrual purposes.  
— 15 —  
8.2  
A Participant who experiences a one year break in service prior to becoming vested and who  
subsequently becomes a Participant in the Plan shall be entitled to have his years of vesting service  
and his years of accredited service for purposes of benefit computation prior to that one year break in  
service counted unless the break in service is a “permanent break in service” within the meaning of  
the following Section 7.3B. Conversely, years of service prior to a “permanent break in service” will  
not be counted.  
A Permanent Break in Service occurs if a nonvested Participant experiences consecutive one year  
breaks in service which equal or exceed, the greater of:  
1. five years of service;  
2. the number of the Participant’s years of service before the break in service.  

### ARTICLE VII  
### Forms of Benefit Payments  
### 
Definitions, The following definitions apply for purposes of this Article VII.  
The term “Annuity Starting Date” shall have the meaning set out in Section 1.24.  
A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who ts married to his spouse on his Annuity  
Starting Date is a form of annuity which pays a lifetime monthly pension payment to the Participant  
and upon the Participant’s death, pays one-half of that amount in monthly payments to the  
“surviving spouse” for the life of the surviving spouse. The Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity fora  
married Participant wil] be the actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would receive  
under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan. The monthly amount of the Participant’s pension  
is reduced in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used by the Plan and the ages of the  
Participant and his spouse.  
A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who has not been married for one year  
immediately prior to his Annuity Starting Date is a life annuity. This annuity shall be the actuarial  
equivalent of the benefit which the Participant would have received under the Normal Form of  
Benefits under this Plan.  
The “surviving spouse” for purposes of this Article is the spouse to whom the Participant was lawfully  
married as of the Annuity Starting Datc. If the “surviving spouse’ predeceases the Participant. no  
survivorship annuity will be payable, even if the Participant remarries. The death of the surviving  
spouse prior to the Participant’s death will not affect the amount of the monthly payment to the  
Participant.  
c € enefits. Effective for any Participant whose Annuity Starting  
Date is July 1, 1976, or thereafter, benefits shall be paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor  
Annuity unless the Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance  
with the provisions of Section 8.3.  
Wai ali ivor  
A participant who 1s otherwise required to receive his benefits in the form of a Qualified Joint and  
Survivor Annuity may waive said form of benefits by filing with the Fund Office a valid waiver during  
the election period. The election period is the ninety (90) day period prior to the Annuity Starting Date.  
Any valid election made during an election period prior to an Annuity Starting Date which is on or  
after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age will govern all payments of benefits earned thereafter.  
Any election may be revoked at any time during the election period.  
In order to be valid, an election to waive the Qualified Jomt and Survivor Annuity must meet the  
following requirements:  
1. It must be in writing.  
2. It must be filed no less than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days after the  
Participant receives the Notice and Explanation described in Section 8.4. The Notice and  
Explanation is presumed to be received on the third day after the date it is mailed.  
— 16—  
8.4.  
A.  
3. In the case of a Participant who had one or more hours of service after August 23, 1984, the  
waiver must be consented to in writing by the Participant’s spouse (unless such consent is not  
required under subsection 8.3B4). Said consent must also acknowledge in writing the effect of  
the election. The consent and acknowledgement required by this subsection must be  
witnessed by a notary public or a plan representative.  
Effective for an election filed with regard to an Annuity Starting Date on or after July 1, 1987,  
the waiver and consent must name the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, who will  
receive survivorship benefits under the Plan and must name the form of benefits to be paid  
under the Plan, (subject to the paragraph). If a consent names a designated  
beneficiary and/or a specific form of benefits, then any subsequent change to said designated  
beneficiary and/or form of benefits is invalid unless a new consent is obtained from the spouse,  
which meets the requirements of this Section 8.3.  
If the consent does not name a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries or a specific form of  
benefits, or tf the Participant and spouse desire that future changes in the beneficiary and/or  
form of benefits may be made without spousal consent, the consent must acknowledge that  
the spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific beneficiary and a specific form of  
benefits and the consent must voluntarily waive whichever (or both) of said rights, in  
accordance with the desires of the Participant and his spouse.  
4. The consent described in this Section 8.3 is not required if it is established to the satisfaction  
of a plan representative that the consent otherwise required cannot be obtained because:  
a. there is no spouse;  
b. the spouse cannot be located; or  
c. such other circumstances exists as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury as  
sufficient to obviate the requirement of the spousal consent.  
   
Within a reasonable time prior to the Annuity Starting Date, the Plan must provide the Participant  
with a notice in writing explaining the terms of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the  
right to waive that Annuity Form of Benefit,. This Notice will be provided within a reasonable  
period of time before the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age and a reasonable period of time  
before any Early Retirement Date or Postponed Retirement Date. A Participant may not elect an  
Annuity Starting Date at any time before the 31st day after he has received the Notice.  
The Notice and Explanation must contain a written explanation of the following:  
1. The terms and conditions of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity;  
2. The Participant’s nght to make an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity  
and the procedure for making the election;  
The effect of an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor form of benefit:  
The rights of the Participant’s spouse, including the right to withhold consent; and  
The right to revoke an election to waive Qualtfied Joint and Suvivor Annuity and the effect of  
such revocation.  
iona Retirement Benefit  
In the event a Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, he may elect to  
receive his benefits in any of the following optional forms:  
1. Life Annuity with a 60 month guarantee (described in Section 5.2 of this Plan).  
—17—  
2. ALife Annuity with 120 month guarantee, which is the same form of payments as the life annuity  
with a 60 month guarantee as described in Section 5.2, but the number of guaranteed payments is  
120. This option may only be selected if the 120 monthly payments will not extend payments  
beyond the life expectancy of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.  
3. ALife Only Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant for his lifetime  
with no further payments after the monthly payment for the month tn which the Participant dies.  
4. A Joint and Full Survivor Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Partictpant  
throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments in the same amount to  
the “surviving spouse”.  
5. A Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity, which provides monthly benefit payments to the  
Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments equal to  
66-2/3% of the amount that the Participant was receiving, to the “surviving spouse”.  
B. All optional forms of benefits (including the Qualified Joint and Suvivor Annuity) shall be adjusted  
so that the actuarial value of the benefit is the eqivalent of the Participant’s accrued benefit  
stated in the Normal Form of Benefit (Section 5.2). Under this Plan, actuarial equivalent means that  
whenever it is necessary to convert one form of annuity to another form of annuity or to a lump sum,  
the result will be benefits substantially equal in value as determined by application of the 1971 Male  
Group Annuity Mortality tables and a 6-1/2% interest rate.  
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustees shall distribute the Participant’s benefits or the Beneficiary’s  
benefits in the form of a lump sum payment on or prior to the annuity starting datc if the present value  
of the benefits does not exceed $5,000. For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as  
of the date of distribution, the Plan shall use the interest rate established by the Pension Benefit  
Guaranty Corporation as of the beginning of the Plan Year for valuing a lump sum distribution upon  
plan termination or individual termination. This section shall not apply after the Annuity Starting Date  
unless the Participant or Beneficiary consents in writing to a single lump sum distribution.

lication for and Timi Benefit Distributi  
9.1 Applications, A Participant or Beneficiary must apply in writing for any benefit payable under this Plan  
in a timely manner, in advance of the Annuity Starting Date. To be timely for this purpose, an application must be  
sufficient to give notice to the Trustees of the applicant’s request to commence receipt of benefits under this Plan.  
Every Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner shall furnish, at the request of the Trustces, any information or proof  
reasonably required to determine his benefit rights. If a person makes a willfully false statement material to an  
application or furnishes fraudulent information or proof, benefits not vested under this Plan (as defined in Article  
VI) may be denied, suspended or discontinued as determined by the Trustees. The Trustees shall have the right to  
recover any benefit payment made in reliance on any false or fraudulent statement, information or proof submitted  
by a Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner.  
9.2 Trustees. The Trustees shall, subject the requirements of the law, be the sole judges of the standard of  
proof required in any case and the application and interpretation of the Plan including decisions concerning the  
eligibility of a Participant or to participate or his entitlement to benefits, and decisions of the Trustees  
shall be final and binding on all parties. In the event an application for benefits ts denied in whole or in part, the  
Participant or Beneficiary must follow the Benefit Claim Procedure set forth in Article X. Wherever in the Plan the  
Trustees are given discretionary powers, the Trustees shall exercise such powers in a uniform and non-  
discriminatory manner.  
9.3 Timing of BenefitCommencement, Payment of benefits may begin sooner but shall begin no later than 60  
days after the last of the following dates, unless the Participant elects a later date (see Section 6.2):  
A. The end of the Plan Year in which the Participant attained Normal Retirement Age;

C. The Annuity Starting Date selected by the participant on an application for benefits filed with the  
Plan; or

Benefit.  
9.4 Limitations on the Timing of Benefit Distribution  
A. As set forth in Section 6.2, a Participant may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date  
which is past his Normal Retirement date, provided:  
l.  
Effective January !, 1984, no Participant may postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date later  
than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Participant  
attains age 70-1/2 or the calendar year in which he ceases working in covered employment. If a  
Participant owns 5% or more of the stock of a Contributing Employer, the benefit must begin no  
later than April | of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains  
age 70-1/2.  
Effective May 1, 1989, benefit commencement may not be postponed later than April 1 of the  
calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant reaches age 70-1/2.  
The latest date on which benefit payments may commence as set out in paragraph 9.4A1 and 2 is  
called the “required beginning date.”  
B. Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to the contrary, benefit payment must meet the  
requirements of either of the following subsections:  
1,  
Pz  
Benefits shall be distributed in full prior to the “required beginning date”, set out in subsection  
9.4A, or

Distribution to a Participant must begin no later than the required beginning date and must be  
made over the life of the Participant (or lives of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse),  
or over a period not exceeding the life expectancy of the Participant (or the life expectancies  
of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse). Distributions (as described in this subsection)  
may be made to a Participant and a nonspouse Beneficiary provided the period used to  
determine the “life expectancies” remains as that of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse.  
If distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with the provisions of subsection 9.4B2a,  
and if the Participant dies before his or her entire interest is distributed, the remaining portion  
of the Participant’s interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution  
method being used as of the date of his death.  
If a Participant dies before the Distribution of the Participant’s interest has begun in  
accordance with subsection 9.4B2a, then the entire interest of the Employee must be  
distributed by December 31 of the fifth calendar year following the year of the Participant’s  
death, subject to the following:  
(1) The five-year payout of the requirement shall not apply if:  
(a) any portion of the Participant’s interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a  
designated beneficiary;

such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life  
expectancy of such beneficiary); and  
(c) such distributions begin not later than one year after the Particiant’s death or such  
later date as may be prescribed by regulations.  
—19—  
(2) If the designated beneficiary referred to in paragraph 9.4B2c(1) is the surviving spouse of  
the Participant, then:  
(a) the date on which distributions are required to begin under 9.4B2c(i)(c) shall not be  
earlier than the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70-1/2; and  
(b) if the surviving spouse dies before the distribution to such spouse begins, this  
subparagraph shall be applied as if the surving spouse were the Participant.

1. $90,000; or  
2. 100% of the Employee’s average annual compensation for the three highest consecutive calendar  
years during which he participated in the Plan or any other Plan maintained by the Employer.

increases in the cost of living. Such cost of living adjustment shall be limited to scheduled increases in  
accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury under Internal Revenue Code § 415(d)  
and shall be effective no sooner than January 1! of each year.  
For purposes of this section “compensation” shall mean the Employce’s earned income, wages,

limited to, paid to salesmen, percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums,  
tips and bonuses), and excluding the following:  
1. to a plan of deferred compensation which are not included in the Employee’s  
gross income for the taxable year in which contributed or Employer contributions under a  
simplified Employee pension plan to the extent such contributions are deductible by the  
Employee, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation.

or not under a salary reduction agreement) towards the purchase of an annuity described in  
Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (whether or not the amounts actually excludable  
from the gross income of the Employee).  
In the case of a Participant who has less than 10 years of accredited service for purposes of benefit  
accrual, the limitations sct forth in subsections BI and 2 of this section shall be multiplied by a  
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Participant’s such years of service and the  
denominator of which ts 10,  
The following additional rules apply for plan years beginning July 1, 1983 to July 1, 1986, inclusive:  
in the case of a Participant whose benefits hereunder commence prior to his attainment of age 62, the  
limitations set forth in subsection A1 of this section shail, in accordance with the regulations issued by  
the Secretary of Treasury, be adjusted so that it is the equivalent to such benefit beginning at age 62,  
provided that such an adjustment shall not reduce such limitation below:

the limitation set forth in subsection AI of this section shall, in accordance with regulations issued by  
the Secretary of Treasury, be adjusted so that it is the actuarial equivalent to the dollar limitation for a  
benefit commencing at age 65. For purposes of adjusting any benefit under this subsection, the interest  
rate assumption shail be 5%.  
Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection A of this section, if a Participant was covered by the Plan  
before the first day of the Limitation Year beginning in 1983, he may receive an annual retirement  
benefit which is not less than the amount of his current accrued benefit as of the close of the last  
Limitation Year beginning before 1983, as determined under the terms of the Plan as then in effect  
disregarding any amendments or cost of living adjustment after July 1, 1982. For the purposes of this  
Section, the term “Limitation Year” shal] mean the Plan Credit Year.  
— 21 —  
F. The following rules apply for Plan Years beginning July 1, 1987 and thereafter. In the case of a  
Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is prior to Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000  
limitation contained in Section 11.1A1 shall be actuarially reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent  
of an annual benefit of $90,000 commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age. In the case of a  
Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is after Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000  
limitation contained in Section 11.1A1 shall be actuarially increased so that it is the actuarial equiva-  
Icnt of an annual benefit of $90,000 commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age.  
G. Ifa Participant covered by this Plan participates in both Defined Benefit and Defined Contributions  
Plans maintained by the Employer, the sum of } and 2 below may not exceed 1.0:

of the Employer determined as of the close of the Limitation Year, divided by the lesser of:  
a. The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(b)(1)(A)  
of the Internal Revenue Code for such year, or  
b. The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Section  
415(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to such Employce for such year.  
2. The sum of the annual additions to the Employee’s account under all defined contributions plans  
of the Employer as of the close of the Limitation Year and for all prior Calendar Years divided by  
the sum of the lesser of a or b for such year and for each prior year of service with the Employer  
(regardless of whether any such defined contribution plan was in existence during those years),  
where;  
a. Is the product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation tn effect under Section 415(c)(1)(A)  
of the Interna] Revenue Code for such year (without regard to Section 415(c)(6) of such  
Code); and  
b. Is the product of 1.4 multiplied by the same amount which may be taken into account under  
Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (or Section 415(c)(7) of such Code, if  
applicable) with respect to such individual under such plan for such year; provided, however,  
that the Board of Trustees may elect that the amount taken into account for each Employee  
for all years ending before January |, 1983, under a and b above shall be determined pursuant  
to the special transition rule in such Section 415(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.  
If this Plan is aggregated with another Plan that was in existence on July }, 1982, and the above  
limitations are not met, each Participant for whom the limits are violated will not receive any  
annual additions or accruals in this Plan. In the event that at the earlier to occur of each December  
31 or the date of an Employee retirement or termination, the sum of | and 2 above exceeds 1.0  
and the benefit of such Employee under such other Plan or Plans is not reduced to bring such  
sums to 1.0, then such Employee’s benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by an amount  
sufficient to cause the sum of | and 2 above for each Employee to equal 1.0.

B. Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.  
Effective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:  
1.  
This Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Credit Year commencing after December 31, 1983,

Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and  
the aggregate accounts of al] Key Employees and Non-Key Employees under this Plan and  
all plans of an Aggregation Group.  
If any Participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key  
Employee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant’s present value of accrued benefits  
and/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining  
whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this  
Plan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31.

410 of the Internal Revenue Code, will be required to be aggregated. Such group shall be  
known as a “Required Aggregation Group.”  
In the case of a required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a  
Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the  
Required Aggregation Group ts a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group  
1s not a Top-Heavy Plan.  
b. An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required  
Aggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to  
satisfy the provisions of Section 401{a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such  
group shall be known as a “Permissive Aggregation Group.”  
In the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required  
Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Group  
is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a  
Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.  
c. Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan  
Credit Ycar shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy  
Plans.  
In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant’s present value of accrued benefits shal! be  
determined:  
a. as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within  
a twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;  
b. for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:  
—295—  
the Participant terminated service as of the Determination Datc; or  
the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account  
the estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.  
for any other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial  
valuation date,  
the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit  
plan minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan  
Credit Year.  
The calculation of a Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date  
shall be the sum of the following:  
a.  
the present value of accrucd benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent  
actuarial valuation;  
any Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date  
or within four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after  
the valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as  
distributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already  
included in the Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.  
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions  
made prior to July |, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been  
terminated would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;  
any Employer contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts  
attributable to tay deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be  
considered to be a part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits;  
with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by  
the Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by  
another Employer), if this Plan provides for roflovers or pian-to-plan transfers, it shall  
always consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this  
section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not  
consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the  
Participant’s present value of accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers  
accepted prior to July |, 1984, shall be considered as part of the Participant’s present value of  
accrued benefits; and  
with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the  
Employee or made to a plan maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the  
rojlover or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this  
section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall  
consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant’s present value of  
accrued benefits, irrespective of the date on which such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer is  
accepted.  
“Top-Heavy Group” means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date,  
the sum of:  
(1) the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans  
included in the group; and  
(2) the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included  
in the group excceds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all  
Participants.  
— 26 —  
g. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for  
herein for the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan  
Credit Years beginning after December 31, 1983) shall be extended in accordance with any  
federal law or regulatory authority.  
C. Top-Heavy Vesting.  
1.  
Z.  
3.  
Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan, for  
any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant’s accrued benefit shall be  
determined on the basis of the Participant’s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the  
following schedule:  
Service for Vesting  
(excluding Years of  
Service for Vesting  
prior to effective Vested  
date of this Pian) percentage  
| Year 0%  
2 years 0%  
3 years 100%  
If, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may  
elect to:  
a. continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant’s  
accrued benefit; or  
revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to  
Section 411(a}(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the  
accrued benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and  
any Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of  
remaining under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a  
Plan amendment.  
The Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Emptoyce who does  
not have one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee’s  
accrued benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this  
Article.  
D. Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.  
1.  
The minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this  
section for cach Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product of:  
a.  
one-twelfth of Annual Compensation averaged over the five consecutive “limitation  
years” (or actual number of “limitation years” if less) which produces the highest average,  
and  
the lesser of  
(1) two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or  
(2) twenty percent (20%).  
2. For purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code,  
a Non-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:  
a.  
b.  
his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or  
he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan  
will be considered to be a Participant.  
27 —  
3. For purpose of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July  
1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top~Heavy Plan shall be  
disregarded.  
4. For purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any “limitation year” ending prior to July  
1, 1984, or subsequent to the last “limitation year” during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan  
shall be disregarded. The term “limitation year” means the Plan Credit Year.  
5. Ifthe Plan provides for the normal retirement to be paid in a form other than a single life annuity,  
the accrued benefit under this section shali be the Actuartal Equivalence of the minimum accrued  
benefit under Article V.  
6. If payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement  
Age, the minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.  
7. If a Non-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included in a  
Required Aggregation Group which 1s Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under  
this Plan.  
8. To the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VII of the Plan, the minimum accrued  
benefit under this section may not be forfeited under Section 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D) of the  
Internal Revenue Code.  

### ARTICLE XI

beginning of the three year pertod ending on the termination date of the Plan, to each  
pension, based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending —  
on such date) under which such pension would be the least. The lowest pension in pay status  
during the three year period shall be considered the pension in pay status for such period.  
b. In the case of a pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which would have been in pay status  
as of the beginning of such three year period if the Participant had retired prior to the  
beginning of the three year period if his pension had commenced (in the standard form) as of  
the beginning of such period, to each such pension based on the provisions of the Plan (as in  
effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which the pension would be the

b. If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph a above, are sufficient to satisfy in  
full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then  
for purpose of subparagraph a, benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall  
be determined on the basis of the Plan as amended by the most recent amendment effective  
during such five year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to  
satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph a and any assets  
remaining to be allocated under subparagraph a on the basis of the Plan as amended by the

designated by the Employers shall at all times be equal, regardless of the number of Employers who may be  
contributing to the Fund. The term “Trustee” as used herein shall mean any natural person designated as a Trustee  
and selected by the Union or the Employer. The Board of Trustees shall be the plan sponsor, administrator and  
named fiduciaries of the Plan.

Board of his intent to so resign. The Union may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by it, by giving thirty (30)  
days’ notice in the United States mail of such intent to discharge. The Employers may discharge any of the Trustees  
appointed by them, by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States mail of such intent to discharge. The  
removal of a Trustee shall be automatic at the end of a 30-day period of notification by either the Trustee or the  
Union or the Employers, as described above, of resignation or removal.  
In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Union shail die, be incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be  
removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Union duly certified by the Board. In the event  
any of the Trustees sclected by the Employers shall die, become incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be  
removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Employers duly certified by the Board. Failure  
of the Union or the Employers to select a successor Trustee promptly shall not prevent the remaining Trustees from  
carrying on the affairs of the Trust.  
For purposes of this Plan, the Trustees are authorized to perform any of the above functions and shall be the Plan  
Fiduciarics. As such, the Trustees shaJ] discharge their duties with respect to the Plan solcly in the interest of the  
participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their  
beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan with the care, skill, prudence and dili-  
gence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such  
matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; by diversifying the invest-  
ments of the Plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to  
do so, and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan (to the extent said documents and  
instruments are consistent with the law), The Fiduciaries may act in one or more fiduciary capacities with respect to  
the Plan and may allocate to others certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the Plan  
including the employment of investment (and other) advisors and investment managers for all or part of the Plan  
assets and the delegation of any ministerial duties or functions to qualified individuals. The Fiduciaries shall be  
responsible for determining the Plan’s short and long-run financial needs from time to time and on the basis thereof  
shall establish a funding policy and method which will carry out the Plan’s objectives and nceds. The Trustees shall  
from time to time adopt appropriate resolutions defining such investment objectives.  
The Trustees are further authorized to appoint one from their number to serve as Managing Trustce and to  
dclegate to such Managing Trustee such authority and responsibility as they determine to delegate and which may  
lawfully be delegated.

Trustees. The Chairman shall be alternately selected from the Trustees representing the Employers and the Trustees  
representing the Union.  
A quorum for the transaction of business shall consist of the presence at the meeting of at least four (4) Trustees,  
two (2) of whom represent the Employers and two (2) of whom represent the Union. Decisions of the Trustees shall  
be made by majority vote. If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attend a meeting, the voting power  
of the group with less Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with more Trustees present  
— 39 —  
so that there shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting. A  
deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever cither of the following situations arise: (1) whenever a proposal, nomi-  
nation motion or resolution or other matter is voted upon and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly  
divided; and (2) whenever a quorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and there shall be absent from said meeting  
two (2) or more Trustees of one group, and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to the inability  
to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the Union  
Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agrceing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by  
casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the  
inability of the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees to agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then  
such impartial umpire shal], on the petition of either the Employer Trustces or Union Trustees, be appointed by the  
Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the district wherein the principal office of the Trust is located.  
The decision of any such impartial umpire shall be final and binding on the Trustces and all concerned.  
Either the Chairman or the Managing Trustee or any two (2) Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees at any  
time by giving at least five (5) days’ written notice of the time and place thereof to cach Trustee. Any meeting so  
called may be postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee upon showing of justifiable  
cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice if all of the Trustees consent  
thereto in writing or if al] attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any proposition, no formal  
meeting thereon need be held by Trustees. The Managing Trustee, in the written notice, shall notify the Trustecs of  
the subjects to be discussed but this shal! not be construed to limit any other subjects of discussion properly placed  
before the meeting.  
The Trustees and Fund Office personnel may receive reimbursement for expenses properly and actually incurred  
in the performance of their duties, including but not limited to expenses incurred in attending educational  
conferences, seminars and meetings, provided that the Trustees determine in each casc the subject matter of the  
conference, seminar or meeting is relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are  
reasonable. The Trustees may adopt travel expenditure guidelines for such expenses. Reasonable compensation

by such Employer, and, with respect to those employces for whose hours of work such Employer owes contributions  
as aforesaid to the Vacation Fund. Such list shall also disclose the number of hours each such employee has worked  
during the weekly period for which contributions are being made.

employee has worked, in order to determine the accuracy and truthfulness thereof, and to report any mistakes, errors

or children of such employee, in equal shares; and if there is no child of such employee living, then fourth to the legal  
representatives of such decreased employee.  
The person or persons entitled to receive such vacation benefits remaining unpaid to the employee at the time of  
such employee's death, shall, as soon as reasonably possible after such death, make a written demand for the payment  
of the same on a form provided for that purpose by the Trustees (which such forms shail be available at the office of  
the Vacation Fund), and shall accompany the same with a certified or photostatic copy of the death certificate of such  
employee. After the expiration of seven (7) days following receipt of such form and death certificate at the office of
