meeting and if the Company schedules a meeting to be held during  
working hours, members of the Grievance Committee who attend the  
meeting will be paid for work time actually lost to attend the meeting at  
their individual straight time hourly rates.  
The Grievance Committee Chairman may call meetings of the Grievance  
Committee during working hours when necessary provided that prior  
permission to hold such meetings is obtained from the Company. Such  
permission will not be unreasonably denied. It is understood that such  
meetings will be kept to a minimum in frequency and length and that  
time spent attending such meetings will not be paid for by the Company.

by the Company as proper subject matter for the grievance procedure.

time off without pay as may be required to visit departments other than  
his own at all reasonable times when his presence is requested by an  
employee who feels he has a bonifide grievance provided, however,  
he obtains permission from his department supervisor and notifies the  
supervisor of the area to be visited. Permission will not be unreasonably  
withheld. Except where, in the opinion of the Company, an emergency  
requires immediate consideration of a complaint or grievance; it is  
agreed that grievance meetings shall not be held during working hours.

be submitted within five (5) working days of the date of the occurrence  
on which it is based, or when event is known or should have been

incident from consideration as grievance.

meeting, the Superintendent or his authorized representative will indicate  
his disposition of the grievance in writing. The Company and the Union

in some way which cannot be handled under existing seniority language,  
the Company and the Union will resolve such seniority problem in a way  
that is equitable to the employees involved and efficient operations.  
16.01 (a) Should there be a consolidation of any job occupation, the  
Company will utilize the CWS classification system as described on  
page 39 and an appropriate wage will be assigned. Any employee who

of discrimination because of membership in the Union. Such layoff  
or discharge cannot be made the subject of a grievance either by the  
employee or the Union. Probationary employees continuing in the  
service of the Company subsequent to their first six (6) calendar months  
from date of hire shall receive full seniority credit from the date of hire or  
rehire as the case may be.
