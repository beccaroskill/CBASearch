This policy will be  \nmaintained so long as there is no change that will materially alter any of the  \nCompanies\u2019 Business Plan achievement.  \nEmployees who utilize personal and/or career development programs  \ndesigned to help them stay abreast of continuing technological and business  \nchanges, and who exercise flexibility in accepting new or changed work  \nassignments and locations, will be assured employment security so long as  \nthere is no change that will materially alter any of the Companies\u2019 Business  \nPlan achievement.  \nSection 2.02 EMPLOYEE CAREER DEVELOPMENT  \nPROGRAMS  \nThe Employee Career Development Program, developed jointly by the  \nCompanies and the National Union, is designed to provide for the ongoing  \ndevelopment of each employee\u2019s capability throughout their careers with  \nthe Companies.  \nA. The Program will be governed by the Vice President \u2014 Human  \nResources and the CWA Vice President, District 9, or their designated  \nrepresentatives, as well as three (3) representatives of the Companies  \nand three (3) representatives of the Union. This Governance Board  \nwill oversee the activities of the Training/Retraining Working  \nCommittees.  \nB. The Companies will provide specific, relevant and timely information  \nregarding existing job opportunities to the Union. This information  \nwill be based on semi-annual force forecasts of future force reductions  \nand job growth areas created by, but not limited to, major technolog-  \nical changes and consolidations. This information will be communi-  \ncated to the appropriate Union and management representatives so that  \nthese representatives can help employees make decisions about their  \nindividual career paths.  \n   \nThe purpose of the Employee Career Development Program is to:  \n1. Educate employees about the necessity for, and reality of, change.  \n2. Enable an employee to assess personal knowledge, skills, attrib-  \nutes, behaviors and goals.  \n3. Determine the knowledge, skills, attributes and behaviors for  \njobs and build a training and/or career path for each participating  \nemployee.  \n4. Provide individual career and development counseling by trained  \ncounselors.  \n5. Encourage employees to take control of their careers and seek out  \nnew career opportunities in sufficient time to take advantage of  \nsuch opportunities.  \n6. Emphasize each employee\u2019s responsibility to seek out and take  \nadvantage of these and other career development tools and  \nprocesses to better ensure their personal employment security.  \nThe Governance Board identified in Section 2.02A will be responsible  \nfor integrating and coordinating the activities of the Training/Retrain-  \ning Working Committees into the Employee Career Development  \nProgram.  \nAll Regular Full and Part-time employees with at least one (1) year of  \nservice will be eligible to participate in the Employee Career Devel-  \nopment Program(s). Participation in the Program(s) shall be voluntary.  \nTime spent by employees in Program activities will normally be out-  \nside of scheduled working hours. Such time will not be paid and will  \nnot be considered as time worked for any purpose.  \nSection 2.03 TRAINING/RETRAINING WORKING  \nA.  \nB.  \nCOMMITTEES  \nThe Training/Retraining Working Committees shall consist of equal  \nnumbers of Company and Union representatives.  \nThe functions of the Training/Retraining Working Committees are to:  \n1. Develop programs which offer additional training opportunities  \nto employees which will allow them to attain new skills and  \npursue different career paths.  \nPropose those programs to the Governance Board for approval of  \nappropriate expenditure of the Training/Retraining funding.  \nAdminister the programs and report on at least a quarterly basis  \nto the Governance Board.  \nC. The provisions of Sections 2.02 and 2.03 do not in any way affect the  \nCompanies\u2019 right to implement the provisions of Article 2, Section  \n2.05, Section 2.06 or Article 8.  \nSection 2.04 THE AUTOMATED UPGRADE AND  \nTRANSFER SYSTEM  \nThe Companies and the National Union agree that the Companies will  \nreplace the Upgrade and Transfer Plan with an automated transfer plan that  \nshall provide placement opportunities for Regular employees. This Plan,  \ncalled the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System (AUTS), will enable  \nRegular employees to move to new job titles and work locations. Such  \nmoves not only benefit the Companies, but also benefit employees by  \nallowing them to influence the direction of their individual careers.  \nA. Regular Transfers  \niL.  \nParticipation in the AUTS shall require employees to verify, supply  \nand update personnel data relative to work experience, testing,  \neducation and training. This information shall be the basis of  \neach employee\u2019s resume maintained in the AUTS database.  \nInformation regarding job openings will be made available to  \nemployees on an automated basis by the Companies. Such infor-  \nmation will also be available to the Union Locals.  \nEligible qualified employees seeking placement can submit trans-  \nfer requests for currently open positions and for future openings.  \nEmployees may have up to six (6) transfer requests at any one  \ntime. These may be upgrade, lateral or downgrade transfer  \nrequests and they may be for future or current vacancies. Each  \ntransfer request will designate a specific title and exchange (See  \nAppendix C4).  \na. Employees will receive reports regarding the activity asso-  \nciated to their transfer requests every four (4) to six (6)  \nweeks.  \n   \nA vacancy will be listed for a minimum of five (5) business days,  \nduring which time eligible employees may submit transfer  \nrequests for the position.  \nThe employee will have two (2) work days to accept or reject a  \njob offer. Once a job offer has been made, all other transfer  \nrequests will be put on hold until the job offer has been accepted  \nor declined.  \nAn employee\u2019s transfer request will be maintained in the active  \nfile and/or considered for current open positions if the employee  \nhas met the prerequisites of satisfactory job performance, time-  \nin-title and time-in-location (as indicated in Appendix C2), test-  \ning and other job requirements as determined by the Companies  \nand indicated on the appropriate job brief.  \na. Least senior identified surplus employees (Section 2.06B 1)  \nand employees placed under the provisions of Section 2.05  \n(Force Balancing) and Section 2.06 (Force Movement) of  \nthis Article will not be required to meet time-in-title and  \ntime-in-location requirements in order to submit transfer  \nrequests following such identification and/or placement.  \nb. employee refuses a job offer which matches a request,  \nthen that request will be cancelled; and it, or any other  \nrequest that would include the same title and exchange, may  \nnot be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months from the  \ndate of refusal. When an employee accepts a job offer, all  \nother transfer requests on file will be cancelled.  \nc. Transfers submitted to AUTS for current positions expire  \nthirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a job match list or  \nupon selection of a candidate for the vacancy, whichever  \noccurs first. Transfers submitted for future positions will  \nremain in file for six (6) months from the date of receipt, but  \nwill be cancelled upon the occurrence of any of the  \nfollowing:  \n1. The employee no longer meets eligibility or qualifica-  \ntions requirements.  \nThe employee withdraws the request.  \n3. The employee leaves the Company payroll.  \n4. The employee is no longer a Regular employee.  \nd. Transfers will remain in file, but on inactive status, if any of  \nthe following are in excess of thirty (30) calendar days:  \nleaves of absence; temporary promotions to management  \nand disabilities.  \ne. Eligible employees not test qualified for positions being  \nsought through AUTS will be provided the opportunity to  \ntake such test(s) in the same order of consideration applica-  \nble to filling job vacancies under Section 2.04B1, subject to  \nthe availability of testing resources and the job vacancy rate  \nfor the positions being sought. Within each step in the  \nsequence of search, employees will be tested in seniority  \norder.  \nB. Selection  \nL.  \nWhen the Companies declare a vacancy, the Companies may list  \non the requisition up to ten (10) skills taken from the job brief.  \nThese skills are in addition to the prerequisites described in  \nSection 2.04A6. Employees will be selected by the skills listed on  \nthe requisition. Skills are based on the employees\u2019 work experi-  \nence, training and education and are listed in their resumes. The  \nCompanies may, at their discretion, interview employees on job  \nmatch lists to confirm their skills. When two (2) or more employ-  \nees have equal skills related to the vacancy, seniority will deter-  \nmine the choice. The normal sequence of search to fill a vacancy  \nwill be:  \na. Qualified employees in the Available Employee File  \nconsisting of personnel returning from medical disability,  \nmilitary, care of newborn children, care of immediate  \nfamily, Union leaves of absence, qualified medically  \nrestricted employees and surplus employees;  \nb. Laid off employees as referenced in Article 8;  \nc. Employees requesting changes of job titles and/or locations;  \nd. New hires.  \nIn applying the provisions of Sections 2.04B 1a through 2.04B Ic,  \nNevada employees will be considered for Nevada positions for  \nwhich they are qualified before such opportunities are made  \n7  \n   \navailable to Pacific employees. Pacific employees will likewise  \nreceive consideration for Pacific positions before such opportu-  \nnities are made available to Nevada employees.  \nEmployees and new hires in Section 2.04Blc through 2.04B1d  \nmay be considered concurrently. When two (2) or more individ-  \nuals are equally qualified, seniority will determine the choice.  \nNotwithstanding Sections 2.04B1 through 2.04B3, VP entities  \nmay reserve up to 50% of their vacancies by title for intra VP  \nentity movement. Those vacancies identified for intra VP entity  \nmovement will be made available to qualified employees within  \nthe same VP entity before such opportunities are made available  \nto employees from other VP entities. Intra VP entity selection will  \nbe determined by skills and seniority as described in Section  \n2.04B1. A VP entity will not have more than 50% of its vacan-  \ncies reserved on a title by title basis at any point in time during  \nthe life of this contract.  \nThe Companies reserve the right to refuse transfers and may  \ninitiate transfers as they deem necessary.  \nC. Retreats  \nD.  \n1.  \nA Regular employee who has accepted a new job assignment,  \nwhich is an upgrade under this Section 2.04, may elect to retreat  \nto the previous department within the first six (6) months after the  \ndate of transfer, except as specified in Section 2.05C and  \n2.06B10. The employee will be reassigned to the previous job or  \na comparable job within the same headquarters as the previous  \njob as a vacancy becomes available. If the Companies and the  \nUnion Local(s) agree, the affected employee may be offered  \na comparable job outside the headquarters.  \nThe receiving department may elect to retreat an employee within  \nthe first six (6) months after the date of transfer except as  \nspecified in Section 2.05C and 2.06B 10.  \nFor both employee and Company initiated retreats, the first six  \n(6) months may be extended for formal classroom training,  \nleaves of absence, or disability.  \nJoint AUTS Review Committee  \n1. The Companies and the National Union will establish a Joint  \nAUTS Review Committee comprised of two (2) Union repre-  \nsentatives and two (2) representatives of the Companies. The  \nresponsibilities of the Committee will include:  \na. Assisting the Companies in providing for an orderly and  \nefficient transition to AUTS;  \nb. Monitoring the ongoing operation of AUTS;  \nc. Analyzing overall AUTS results;  \nAddressing concerns raised as to the staffing of positions  \nthrough AUTS.  \n2. The Joint Review Committee will meet on a regular basis, but not  \nless than once each quarter.  \n3. The Joint Review Committee is not empowered to enter into  \nagreements modifying the Contract, employees\u2019 wages, benefits  \n(or other forms of compensation), job titles or representation  \nstatus.  \n4. Agreements made by the Joint Review Committee will not prej-  \nudice the position of either the Companies or the Union and will  \nnot be cited in any other proceeding. Such agreements will not be  \nsubject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.  \n   \n5. Individual placement decisions made pursuant to the AUTS shall  \nbe subject to the grievance procedure. Issues not resolved in the  \ngrievance procedure may be presented to the Joint AUTS Review  \nCommittee for final and binding resolution. Neither the AUTS  \nnor its administration shall be subject to arbitration.  \nMini-Transfers  \nThe mini-transfer procedure is completely separate from the process  \ndescribed in Section 2.04A. The mini-transfer process is administered  \nby local management without the involvement of the Placement organ-  \nization. Local management will consider mini-transfer requests before  \nissuing a requisition. Time-in-title and time-in-location is accrued for  \nemployees who change their shift, location or status due to a mini-  \ntransfer.  \n1. Regular employees (except for Operator Services employees  \nlisted in Appendix A, Section A3.01A) may submit local requests  \nto change their shifts (day, evening or night) within their title and  \n9  \ntheir building locations or other organizational units as  \ndetermined by the Companies and the Union. If there are no  \nwritten requests on file, the available qualified employees within  \nthe building or organizational unit as determined by the  \nCompanies and the Union will be offered the vacancy.  \nRegular employees (including Operator Services employees  \nlisted in Appendix A, Section A3.01) may submit local requests  \nto change their work locations within their same titles. Requests  \nfor change in work locations will be to different buildings, or to  \ndifferent organizational units within the same district.  \nRegular employees (including Operator Services employees  \nlisted in Appendix A, Section A3.01) may submit local requests  \nto change their status from full-time to part-time or from part-  \ntime to full-time. Requests for change in status will be within the  \nemployee\u2019s title and their building locations or other organiza-  \ntional units as determined by the Companies and the Union.  \nWhen a vacancy occurs, the Companies will review requests  \nfrom available qualified employees. Employees will be consid-  \nered in order of seniority. The normal sequence of search to fill  \na vacancy will be:  \na. Employees requesting change of shifts under Section  \n2.04E1;  \nb. Employees requesting change of locations under Section  \n2.04E2;  \nc. Employees requesting change of status under Section  \n2.04E3;  \nd. Requests will be honored within the same State before  \nallowing for interstate movement.  \nThe qualifications and availability of employees for the purpose  \nof administering this Section 2.04E will be determined by the  \nCompanies.  \nSection 2.05 FORCE BALANCING  \nWhenever any conditions, including economic or force conditions or tech-  \nnological change (defined as changes in equipment or methods of opera-  \ntions), are considered by the Companies to warrant relocation of existing  \n10  \nwork and/or rearrangement of employees, Regular employees may be  \nreassigned. Prior to such reassignment(s), management will inform the  \naffected Union Local(s) of the proposed move(s). The parties will then  \ndiscuss the need for such reassignment and may explore possible alterna-  \ntives. If the parties do not agree, the Companies will administer the  \nreassignment of Regular employees.  \nIf the reassignment of Regular employees is deemed necessary by the  \nCompanies, the following provisions will apply:  \nA. Relocation of Existing Work  \niL.  \nIn applying the provisions of Section 2.05A, the affected work  \ngroup will be considered to be an administrative work unit. An  \nadministrative work unit is defined as those employees who have  \nthe same title classification and who perform similar work, as  \ndetermined by the Companies, and share a common overtime list  \nand vacation schedule or, if not sharing both the same overtime  \nlist and vacation schedule, sharing either the same overtime list  \nor vacation schedule, whichever list or schedule is smaller.  \nWhen only a portion of the work performed within an adminis-  \ntrative work unit is to be relocated, employees will be offered the  \nopportunity to follow the relocated work based on net credited  \nservice as shown by the records of the Companies.  \nIf the amount of work to be relocated equates to less than one (1)  \nfull employee\u2019s work, the Companies, at their discretion, may  \nallow an employee to follow that portion of relocated work.  \nIf the relocation of existing work involves a move for an  \nemployee which is considered commutable, the employee will  \nfollow the work to the new location. Commutable employees  \nwho refuse reassignment under the provisions of this Section  \nand least senior commutable employees who refuse reassign-  \nment under Section 2.05B will be considered to have voluntarily  \nresigned and will not be entitled to Separation Benefits.  \nIf the relocation of existing work is to a non-commutable  \nlocation, the employee may elect to either follow the relocated  \nwork or be identified as surplus. In the latter case, the employee  \nwill be administered according to the provisions of Article 2,  \nSection 2.06.  \n14  \n   \nB. Force Rearrangements  \n1.  \nIn an attempt to avoid the declaration of surplus, or to balance the  \nforce, the Companies may rearrange employees in the same title,  \nconsolidated headquarters (Section 2.09B) and Presidential  \nentity. The Companies will determine the appropriate work  \ngroup(s) within the title, consolidated headquarters and Presi-  \ndential entity for administration of the force rearrangement(s).  \nThere is no requirement to use any of the force rearrangement  \nprocedures prior to declaring a surplus.  \nPrior to a force rearrangement, the Companies will inform the  \naffected Union Local(s) of the proposed move(s). Those Union  \nLocal(s) and the Companies will discuss the need for the force  \nrearrangement(s), possible alternatives and whether any \u201caddi-  \ntional vacancies,\u201d as described in Section 2.05B4, will be offered.  \nThe Union Local(s) and the Companies will meet and discuss  \nthese issues in a timely manner. If there is no agreement between  \nthe Union Local(s) and the Companies, the Companies will  \nadminister the force rearrangement(s).  \nThe least senior qualified surplus employees in the affected work  \ngroup (\u201caffected employees\u2019\u2019) will be offered the available jobs  \nin their same title, consolidated headquarters and Presidential  \nentity. By seniority, the affected employees may elect to take  \nsuch vacancies or replace the least senior employee with the  \nsame title within the same consolidated headquarters and within  \nthe same VP entity who is outside the affected work group. This  \nprocess will continue until all available vacancies in the title,  \nconsolidated headquarters and Presidential entity are filled.  \na. If the most senior of the affected employee(s) elects not to  \nreplace the least senior employee in the title, consolidated  \nheadquarters and VP entity, then the most senior of the  \naffected employee(s) will be assigned to a vacancy.  \nb. If the most senior of the affected employee(s) elects to  \nreplace the least senior employee in the title, consolidated  \nheadquarters and VP entity, then the replaced employee will  \nbe held out of the process until all the affected employee(s)  \nwho have more seniority than the replaced employee(s)  \nhave the opportunity to either replace the remaining least  \nsenior employee(s) in the title, consolidated headquarters  \n12  \nand VP entity or be assigned to a vacancy. If there are no  \nremaining affected employees with more seniority than a  \nreplaced employee(s), the replaced employee(s) will be  \nassigned to a vacancy, if available.  \nIf the Companies and the affected Union Local(s) agree during  \ntheir advance discussions, the affected employees may also be  \noffered any or all of the following types of available jobs in their  \nPresidential entity (\u2018additional vacancies\u2019\u2019):  \n\u00a2 same title which are outside the consolidated headquarters;  \n* same wage schedule within the consolidated headquarters;  \n\u00a2 and same wage schedule which are outside the consolidated  \nheadquarters.  \nIf any such additional vacancies are made available to the  \naffected employees, the same process described in Sections  \n2.05B3, 2.05B3a and 2.05B3b will be followed. That is, by sen-  \niority, the affected employees may elect to take an offered  \nvacancy, including an additional vacancy, or replace the least  \nsenior employee with the same title within the same consoli-  \ndated headquarters and within the same VP entity who is outside  \nthe work group. This process will continue until all offered  \nvacancies, including additional vacancies, are filled.  \nEmployees who choose not to accept a commutable assignment  \nwill leave the service of the Companies. Employees who choose  \nnot to accept a non-commutable assignment will leave the service  \nof the Companies and receive Separation Benefits.  \nEmployees who accept a non-commutable assignment under  \nSection 2.05B will be entitled to relocation expense reimburse-  \nment. Such employees will also be entitled to submit unlimited  \nrequests through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System for  \nsix (6) months from the effective date of their assignment. If an  \nemployee had the option of accepting a commutable job (other  \nthan replacing the least senior employee with the same title  \nwithin the same consolidated headquarters and VP entity), but  \nelected a non-commutable job, the employee will not receive  \nrelocation expense reimbursement and will not be eligible to  \nsubmit unlimited requests through the Automated Upgrade and  \nTransfer System for the six (6)-month period.  \n13  \n   \n7. The Companies will inform the affected Union Local(s) of the  \nresults of a force rearrangement no later than thirty (30) calendar  \ndays after the effective date. The results will include the effective  \ndate of the force rearrangement, involved work locations and the  \nname, title and net credited service (NCS) date of each involved  \nemployee.  \nEmployees reassigned under the provisions of Section 2.05 will have  \nLimited Return Rights for up to 24 months from the effective  \ndate of their assignment. Limited Return Rights are to the  \nemployee\u2019s former title, exchange and VP entity.  \nAs used in this Section 2.05 and Section 2.06, the term \u201cqualified\u201d  \nrefers to employees who have met the basic requirements of the job,  \nincluding all tests, requirements and physical classifications as stated  \nin the Jobs Handbook.  \nSection 2.06 FORCE MOVEMENT  \nA.  \nPrior to a declaration of surplus, the Companies will implement any  \nor all of the following steps:  \n1. Maintain overtime at a minimum level within the surplus work  \ngroup.  \n2. Terminate Temporary, Term and Occasional employees, if appro-  \npriate, where the Companies determine that surplus employees  \nare qualified to perform the work.  \n3. Stop hiring in the surplus title within the surplus work group.  \nForce Movement Process  \n1. The Presidential entity (or if there is no Presidential entity, the  \nhighest level entity below Presidential entity) will notify the  \naffected Union Local(s) and the Executive Director-Labor Rela-  \ntions fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the surplus declaration  \ndate. The Presidential entity (or if there is no Presidential  \nentity, the highest level entity below Presidential entity) will  \nnotify the surplus work group ten (10) calendar days prior to  \nthe surplus declaration date. If the Union Local(s) so choose,  \nthey may join in the roll-out scheduled by the Companies to  \nnotify the surplus work group. Labor Relations will notify the  \nNational Union in writing of a declaration of surplus.  \n14  \na. Awork group is defined as one containing Regular employ-  \nees with the same job title in a specific consolidated head-  \nquarters (see Section 2.09B) within a Company Presidential  \nentity. In Company organizations without a Presidential  \nlevel of management, a work group will consist of Regular  \nemployees with the same job title in a specific consolidated  \nheadquarters within the highest level entity below  \nPresidential level.  \nb. Surplus employees are the least senior employees in a  \nsurplus work group.  \nLiaison Committees comprised of Company and Union repre-  \nsentatives will be established (one (1) for Northern California and  \nNevada and one (1) for Southern California) to function in an  \noversight role regarding problems encountered during the place-  \nment of surplus employees. The membership of each Liaison  \nCommittee will be comprised of one (1) representative from  \nCWA District 9, one (1) representative from the affected CWA  \nLocal(s) and one (1) each from Labor Relations, the affected  \nCompany department and the Placement organization. These  \ncommittees are empowered to resolve any issues or problems  \nregarding the placement of employees under the Force  \nMovement process described in Sections 2.06B and 2.06C.  \na. The Liaison Committees are not empowered to enter into  \nagreements modifying the Contract, with respect to  \nemployee\u2019s wages, benefits (or other forms of compensa-  \ntion), job titles or representation status.  \nb. Agreements made by the Liaison Committees regarding the  \nplacement of surplus employees will not prejudice the posi-  \ntion of either the Companies or the Union and will not be  \ncited in any other proceeding. Such agreements will not be  \nsubject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.  \nc. Unresolved issues or problems regarding the placement of  \nsurplus employees will not delay or defer the Force Move-  \nment process. In the event the Liaison Committee is unable  \nto resolve a problem within thirty (30) days, the issue(s)  \nmay then be addressed under the grievance and arbitration  \nprovisions of this Contract. To ensure timely resolution of  \ngrievances regarding the placement of surplus employees,  \n15  \n   \nsuch grievances will bypass Step I and Step II of the griev-  \nance process and be forwarded to the National Union Rep-  \nresentative and Labor Relations Director with a summary of  \nfacts and the positions of each party prepared by the  \nappropriate Liaison Committee.  \nd. The Liaison Committees will discuss temporary and term  \npositions that would be appropriate for consideration for  \nsurplus work groups. These committees are empowered to  \nimplement placement options in the appropriate Company  \norganizations in an effort to relieve the surplus.  \ne. The Liaison Committees will discuss positions that are  \nbeing made available for new hires that would be appro-  \npriate for consideration for surplus work groups. These  \ncommittees are empowered to implement placement  \noptions regarding these positions in the appropriate  \nCompany organizations in an effort to relieve the  \nsurplus.  \nWhen a work group is notified of a surplus declaration, the Com-  \npanies will offer Separation Benefits, as described in Section  \n2.07, the Special Leave of Absence and the Transition Leave of  \nAbsence to employees within the surplus work group, within the  \nfirst ten (10) calendar days of the notice period. Employees may  \nelect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separa-  \ntion Benefits or one (1) of the above referenced leaves to the  \nextent necessary to relieve the surplus.  \nDeclaration of surplus shall not be made more frequently than  \nonce every three (3) calendar months for each specific work  \ngroup.  \nOnce surplus has been declared to the Union, all activities under  \nSection 2.05B will cease for the surplus work group(s).  \nAll Regular employees within a surplus work group will be given  \npriority consideration for all available lateral (same wage sched-  \nule) and downgrade jobs, except jobs that are represented by  \nother unions, beginning on the surplus declaration date (see Sec-  \ntion 2.06B1). However, surplus employees represented by CWA  \nwill not be offered jobs in the non-represented unit if a declared  \nsurplus condition exists in that non-represented unit and will not  \n16  \nbe given priority consideration for those jobs if a surplus condi-  \ntion exists in another bargaining unit.  \na.  \nAll Regular employees in the surplus work group who wish  \nto volunteer for the available lateral and downgrade jobs  \nmay submit unlimited requests for current and future jobs  \nthrough the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System begin-  \nning on the surplus declaration date.  \nQualified employees who have submitted transfer requests  \npursuant to Section 2.06B6 will be matched to jobs by  \nseniority.  \nEmployees will have two (2) work days to accept or decline  \na job offer. Employees in a surplus work group who choose  \nnot to accept an offer for a position for which they had sub-  \nmitted in accordance with Section 2.06B6 will leave the  \nservice of the Companies.  \nEmployees who accept jobs outside the CWA bargaining  \nunit will assume the representation status of those jobs.  \nThe Placement Areas for employees covered by this  \nContract are:  \n1. For California employees:  \nBay Los Angeles  \nNorth Coast Orange/Riverside  \nSacramento/North San Diego/Imperial  \nValley Central Coast  \n2. For Nevada employees:  \nThe State of Nevada  \nThe Rearrangement Areas for employees covered by this  \nContract are:  \n1. Southern California from the Tehachapi mountains to  \nthe Mexican Border for employees working in  \nSouthern California.  \n2. Northern California from the Tehachapi mountains to  \nthe Oregon border for employees working in Northern  \nCalifornia.  \n3. Nevada for employees working in Nevada.  \n17  \n   \nIf the procedures described in Sections 2.06B3 through 2.06B6  \nhave not resolved a declared surplus at the conclusion of thirty  \n(30) calendar days including the date of the declaration, the  \nremaining least senior identified surplus employees in the work  \ngroup will be offered the Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option  \n(VSRO) as described in Section 2.07K. Employees may elect the  \nVSRO or elect to be assigned to available Regular full-time posi-  \ntions (i.e., lateral, downgrade, commutable, non-commutable)  \nwithin the CWA bargaining unit. Regular employees in the sur-  \nplus work group may also continue to volunteer for lateral and  \ndowngrade positions as described in Section 2.06B6a until the  \nCompanies determine that the surplus is resolved in their work  \ngroup.  \na. The Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO) includes  \nSeparation Benefits as described in Section 2.07, an addi-  \ntional $3,000 and eighteen (18) months unlimited access to  \nAUTS with selection status the same as that of employees  \nrequesting changes of job titles and/or locations (see Section  \n  \nb. Least senior identified surplus employees will have five (5)  \ncalendar days within which to make their election between  \nVSRO or assignment.  \nc. Qualified least senior identified surplus employees who  \ndecline VSRO or who do not make any election within the  \nfive (5) calendar days will be assigned to available positions.  \nd. The order of selection will be:  \n1. by seniority, qualified volunteers in the surplus work  \ngroup;  \n2. qualified least senior identified surplus employees who  \nremain surplus after the thirty (30) day voluntary  \nphase described in Section 2.06B6.  \ne. Qualified least senior identified surplus employees will be  \nassigned in the following order:  \n\u00a2 lateral jobs within the Placement Area by seniority;  \n\u00a2 downgrade jobs within the Placement Area by seniority;  \n\u00a2 lateral jobs within the Rearrangement Area by inverse  \nseniority;  \n18  \n\u00a2 downgrade jobs within the Rearrangement Area by  \ninverse seniority;  \n\u00a2 lateral jobs within California for employees of the  \nCompanies in California by inverse seniority;  \n\u00a2 downgrade jobs within California for employees of the  \nCompanies in California by inverse seniority.  \nIf the Companies deem appropriate, certain qualifications  \nmay be waived under the provisions of this Section 2.06B7.  \nEmployees who choose not to accept an offer for a job  \nwhich is a commutable lateral position will leave the service  \nof the Companies. Employees who choose not to accept an  \noffer for a job which is a downgrade and/or non-com-  \nmutable position will leave the service of the Companies  \nand receive Separation Benefits and eighteen (18) months  \nunlimited access to AUTS with selection status the same as  \nthat of employees requesting changes of job titles and/or  \nlocations (see Section 2.04B 1c).  \nThose employees placed through the force movement process  \nwill have Return Rights for up to twenty-four (24) months from  \nthe effective date of their assignment.  \na.  \nThose employees with Return Rights will have up to  \ntwenty-four (24) months unlimited access to AUTS for any  \nregular position.  \nThose employees with Return Rights will have concurrent  \nconsideration with candidates described in Sections 2.04B1c  \nand 2.04B1d and priority selection status if equally qualified  \nwith the most qualified candidate of those described in  \nSections 2.04Blc and 2.04B 1d.  \nReturn Rights will cease when an employee is placed in a  \nposition through AUTS prior to the expiration of the  \ntwenty-four (24) month period.  \nNotwithstanding any other provisions in the contract,  \nemployees with Return Rights who accept positions through  \nAUTS will not be entitled to Relocation Expense  \nreimbursement.  \n19  \n   \n10.  \n11.  \nEmployees who accept downgrade positions under Section 2.06  \nwill be entitled to Reassignment Pay Protection Plan Benefits as  \ndescribed below:  \nLESS THAN 15 YEARS OF NET CREDIT SERVICE  \nWEEKS WAGE REDUCTION  \n1 through 52 None  \n53 through 57 1/3  \n58 through 62 2/3  \n63 & thereafter Full  \n15 OR MORE YEARS OF NET CREDITED SERVICE  \nWEEKS WAGE REDUCTION  \n1 through 160 None  \n161 through 164 1/3  \n165 through 168 2/3  \n169 & thereafter Full  \nThere are no retreat rights for employees placed into available  \njobs under the provisions of Section 2.06. However, employees  \nwho fail formal training after such placement will be returned to  \ntheir former organizations, will be placed back into the force  \nmovement process and will be assigned to a Regular full-time  \n(lateral/downgrade) position as described in Section 2.06B7.  \nThe Companies may engage in selective hiring during the Force  \nMovement Process.  \nIf no Regular jobs are available, the remaining surplus employees  \nwill be offered the opportunity to either replace certain commutable  \ncontract labor if appropriate, or to leave the service of the Companies  \nand receive Separation Benefits. Surplus employees who fail to make  \na choice relative to available contract jobs will leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive Separation Benefits.  \n1.  \nQualified employees who replace contract labor will be entitled  \nto Reassignment Pay Protection Plan Benefits as described in  \nSection 2.06B9. For purposes of determining the appropriate  \nwage reduction, the competitive wage rate (prevailing rate for the  \ncontract job minus the value of Company-paid benefits) will be  \nconsidered the wage rate of the contract job. Assignments involv-  \ning the replacement of contract labor will be considered  \ntemporary until a Regular job is available.  \n20  \na. Employees in temporary contract jobs will be automatically  \nmatched in order of seniority to Regular lateral or down-  \ngrade jobs as positions become available. Employees may  \nexpress their preferences for reassignment by submitting  \ntransfer requests through the Automated Upgrade and  \nTransfer System. They may designate any lateral or down-  \ngrade job titles as the job titles in which they wish to be  \nplaced should vacancies occur.  \nb. Employees in temporary contract jobs who choose not to  \naccept an offer of a Regular job will leave the service of the  \nCompanies.  \nAt any time during the force movement process, if the Companies  \ndetermine that surplus has been resolved in a work group, the Com-  \npanies may rearrange the force as described in Section 2.05B.  \nIn the event that no commutable contract jobs are offered to surplus  \nemployees, the remaining surplus will be maintained until such time  \nas a Regular lateral or downgrade job may be offered, or until the  \nCompanies inform the National Union in writing of their intent to lay  \noff Regular employees.  \n1.  \nMaintained surplus employees who choose not to accept a com-  \nmutable lateral job offer will leave the service of the Companies.  \nMaintained surplus employees who choose not to accept a down-  \ngrade or anon-commutable job offer will leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive Separation Benefits.  \nMaintained surplus employees may, at the Companies\u2019 discretion,  \nbe placed into commutable part-time jobs, if such jobs are avail-  \nable. Surplus employees who choose not to accept an offer of a  \ncommutable part-time job will leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive Separation Benefits.  \nManagers may be reassigned to the bargaining unit utilizing either of  \nthe following provisions:  \n1.  \nManagement employees may be reassigned to the bargaining  \nunit provided there are no significantly qualified employees (i.e.,  \nemployees who perform similar work, as determined by the  \nCompanies) with greater seniority available to fill the vacancy  \nwith a transfer request on file for the position to which the  \nmanager would be assigned.  \n21  \n   \nAn administrative addition may be created, whereby the man-  \nagement employee may be reassigned to the work group.  \nIf a manager (who has been a manager for six (6) continuous  \nmonths or more immediately prior to the reassignment) is reas-  \nsigned to the bargaining unit, surplus shall not be declared in that  \nwork group for six (6) months or until the force level is reduced  \nto the level which existed in that work group prior to the reas-  \nsignment of the manager, whichever occurs first.  \nSection 2.07 SEPARATION BENEFITS (For Pacific Bell  \nHome Entertainment, see Appendix B,  \nSection B2.01)  \nA. If during the term of this agreement, the Companies notify the  \nNational Union in writing that a surplus condition exists for any reason  \nthat will necessitate the reassignment of Regular employees, and the  \nCompanies deem it appropriate, the Companies may offer Separation  \nBenefits in such job titles and such work locations as the Companies  \ndetermine to be appropriate. If the Companies elect to so offer, Regular  \nemployees may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive Separation Benefits subject to the following  \nconditions:  \n1.  \nThe Companies will determine the job titles and work locations  \nin which the surplus exists, the number of employees in such  \ntitles and work locations who are considered to be surplus and the  \nperiod during which the employee may, if he or she so elects,  \nleave the service of the Companies. None of the determinations  \nby the Companies nor any part of this Section 2.07 will be subject  \nto arbitration.  \nThe number of employees who elect to leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive Separation Benefits shall not exceed the  \nnumber of employees determined by the Companies to be  \nsurplus.  \nAn employee\u2019s election to leave the service of the Companies and  \nreceive Separation Benefits must be in writing and transmitted to  \nthe Companies within ten (10) calendar days including the date  \nof the offer. The employee may designate on the election form  \nthat the election is to be effective and irrevocable immediately. If  \n22  \nthe employee does not so designate, such election may not be  \nrevoked after the ten (10) calendar day period.  \nIf the Companies deem it appropriate, they may elect to offer Separa-  \ntion Benefits to selected titles in a work group (see Section 2.06B 1a)  \nas a force management tool. The Companies will notify the National  \nUnion in writing when any such offer is made. The Companies also  \nwill, in advance of making this offer to employees, discuss the matter  \nwith the affected Union Local(s). After this discussion, if the Compa-  \nnies elect to so offer, Regular employees may elect, in order of  \nseniority, to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation  \nBenefits subject to the following conditions:  \n1. The Companies will determine the job titles and the work loca-  \ntions for which the offer is to be made, the number of employees  \nwho may accept the offer and the period during which the  \nemployees may, if they so elect, leave the service of the Compa-  \nnies. None of the determinations of the Companies nor any part  \nof this Section 2.07 will be subject to arbitration.  \n2. The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive Separation Benefits shall not exceed the  \nnumber of employees identified by the Companies on the date of  \nthe offer to be appropriate.  \n3. Anemployee\u2019s election to leave the service of the Companies and  \nreceive Separation Benefits must be in writing and transmitted to  \nthe Companies within ten (10) calendar days including the date  \nof the offer. The employee may designate on the election form  \nthat the election is to be effective and irrevocable immediately. If  \nthe employee does not so designate, such election may not be  \nrevoked after the ten (10) calendar day period.  \nEmployees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and  \nreceive Separation Benefits will receive payments based on the  \nemployee\u2019s net credited service and basic weekly wage rate at the time  \nof leaving the Companies as indicated below:  \n23  \n   \nYEARS OF SERVICE SEPARATION PAYMENTS  \n0 1 week of pay  \n1 2 weeks of pay  \n2 4 weeks of pay  \n3 6 weeks of pay  \n4 8 weeks of pay  \n5 10 weeks of pay  \n6 12 weeks of pay  \n7 14 weeks of pay  \n8 16 weeks of pay  \n9 18 weeks of pay  \n10 20 weeks of pay  \n11 23 weeks of pay  \n12 25 weeks of pay  \n13 27 weeks of pay  \n14 29 weeks of pay  \n15 31 weeks of pay  \n16 35 weeks of pay  \n17 37 weeks of pay  \n18 39 weeks of pay  \n19 41 weeks of pay  \n20 43 weeks of pay  \n21 45 weeks of pay  \nZZ, 47 weeks of pay  \n23 49 weeks of pay  \n24 51 weeks of pay  \n25+ 53 weeks of pay  \nD. Employees may select one of the following payment options for  \nSeparation Benefits:  \n1. A single payment paid by the end of the month following the  \nmonth in which the employee separates; or  \n2. Asingle payment paid at the end of the first quarter of the year  \nfollowing separation; or  \n3. A partial payment, in the amount determined by the employee,  \npaid by the end of the month following the month in which the  \nemployee separates, with payment of the balance deferred until  \nthe end of the first quarter of the year following separation; or  \n24  \n4. Monthly payments beginning the month following the month in  \nwhich the employee leaves the service of the Companies until all  \npayments have been made.  \nThe years of net credited service will be prorated for any period during  \nwhich an employee is employed on a part-time basis in the same man-  \nner as calculated in the Pacific Telesis Group Pension Plan.  \nAs used in this Section, \u201cbasic weekly wage rate (or its equivalent)\u201d  \ndoes not include differentials, overtime or any other extra payments.  \nAt the time of reemployment with the Companies, a recipient of the  \nSeparation Benefits must repay the entire unused portion of the pay-  \nment (the number of weeks of payment minus the number of weeks off  \nthe payroll). Repayment may be made in whole or by payroll deduc-  \ntions in each payroll period. Deductions will be made at the rate of at  \nleast ten (10) percent per week of the employee\u2019s basic weekly wage  \nrate. The entire amount must be repaid within twelve (12) months of  \nreemployment.  \nIn those cases where payment has been deferred and the employee has  \nnot received final payment at the time of reemployment, the employee  \nwill receive a single payment for the actual number of weeks off the  \npayroll.  \nIn those cases where the recipient has elected, or is receiving, monthly  \npayments of Separation Benefits, such payments will be suspended  \nupon reemployment with the Companies.  \nEmployees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and  \nreceive Separation Benefits will continue to receive six (6) months of  \ncontinued Company paid medical, dental and vision coverage, begin-  \nning on the date of their separation, with eligibility for COBRA cov-  \nerage beginning at the end of the continued Company paid coverage.  \nLeast senior identified surplus employees within a surplus work group  \nthat remain surplus after the thirty (30) day voluntary phase of the  \nforce movement process described in Section 2.06B6 will be offered  \nand may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the Com-  \npanies and receive the Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO)  \nsubject to the following conditions. VSRO includes:  \n\u00a2 Separation Benefits as described above in Section 2.07  \n\u00a2 $3,000 added to the Separation Benefits payment  \n\u00a2 Eighteen (18) months unlimited access to AUTS  \n25  \n   \n1. The Companies will determine the period during which the  \nemployee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the  \nCompanies. None of the determinations by the Companies nor  \nany part of this Section 2.07K will be subject to arbitration.  \n2. The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the  \nCompanies and receive VSRO shall not exceed the number of  \nemployees determined by the Companies to be surplus.  \n3. Anemployee\u2019s election to leave the service of the Companies and  \nreceive VSRO must be in writing and transmitted to the Compa-  \nnies within five (5) calendar days of the last day in the thirty (30)  \nday voluntary phase of the force movement process. Such elec-  \ntion may not be revoked after the five (5) calendar day period.  \n4. The $3,000 will be added to and paid with Separation Benefits in  \nthe manner elected as a payment option under Section 2.07D.  \n5. At the time of reemployment with the Companies, a recipient of  \nVSRO must repay the entire unused portion of the payment (the  \nnumber of weeks of payment minus the number of weeks off the  \npayroll). The $3,000 will equate to four (4) weeks of pay and that  \nfour (4) weeks will be added to the number of weeks of Separa-  \ntion Benefits for this purpose. Repayment may be made in whole  \nor by payroll deductions as described in Section 2.07G.  \n6. In those cases where payment has been deferred and the  \nemployee has not received final payment at the time of reem-  \nployment, the employee will receive a single payment for the  \nactual number of weeks off the payroll calculated as described in  \nSection 2.07K5 above.  \n7. In those cases where the recipient has elected, or is receiving,  \nmonthly payments of VSRO (i.e., the $3,000 added to and paid  \nwith Separation Benefits), such payments will be suspended upon  \nreemployment with the Companies.  \nSection 2.08 RELOCATION EXPENSE (The provisions of  \nthis section do not apply to Pacific Bell  \nHome Entertainment)  \nA. Employees who, in the judgment of the Companies, are required to  \nrelocate their residence as a result of a permanent Company-initiated  \ntransfer shall receive reimbursement for reasonable moving expenses  \n26  \nas agreed upon from time to time between the Companies and the  \nNational Union.  \n1. Employees accepting non-commutable positions under Sections  \n2.05, 2.06B, 2.06C, 2.06D and 2.06E will be entitled to  \nrelocation expense reimbursement.  \nB. If there is no change of residence, as covered in Section 2.08A, the  \nemployee will not receive any reimbursement for moving expenses  \nunder this Section 2.08.  \nC. When an employee requests a change of headquarters, the expenses  \ninvolved in such change shall be borne by the employee.  \nD. When an employee is returned to a previously held work assignment  \nbecause of failure to meet performance requirements in connection  \nwith an employee-initiated transfer, any cost incurred by the returned  \nemployee will be borne by the employee.  \nE. For the purposes of this Article, an assignment shall be considered  \nnon-commutable if the distance from the employee\u2019s permanent resi-  \ndence to the new work location is greater than that from the  \nemployee\u2019s permanent residence to the former work location and the  \nactual one-way commuting distance exceeds forty-five (45) miles or  \nthe actual one-way commuting time is greater than sixty (60) minutes  \nby personal vehicle or greater than ninety (90) minutes by public  \ntransportation.  \n   \nSection 2.09 ASSIGNMENT OF HEADQUARTERS  \n(For Pacific Bell Home Entertainment, see  \nAppendix B, Section B2.08)  \nA.

Such time  \noff will generally not be granted in cases where an overtime or  \npremium rate would have to be paid to the employee or employ-  \nees replacing the Union representatives. As used in this Article  \nthe terms \u201cexcused absence\u201d and \u201cleave of absence\u201d are defined  \nas follows:  \n\u00a2 EXCUSED ABSENCE \u2014 An unpaid absence not exceeding  \nthirty (30) consecutive calendar days.  \n\u00a2 LEAVE OF ABSENCE - An unpaid absence of over thirty  \n(30) consecutive calendar days covered by a written leave of  \nabsence.  \nThe period of excused absence shall be used solely for the pur-  \npose of enabling authorized representatives of the Union to carry  \non activities of the Union directly concerning its relations with  \nthe Companies in connection with employees of the Companies  \ncovered by this Contract, except that the period of absence may  \nbe used to attend, for short periods of time, national or regional  \nconventions or meetings of the Union.  \n36  \nThe period of leave of absence shall be used for the purpose of  \nenabling authorized representatives of the Union to carry on  \nactivities of the Union concerning its relations with the Compa-  \nnies in connection with employees of the Companies represented  \nby the Union, within the States or portions of States served by the  \nCompanies, except that,  \na. the period of absence may be used to attend national or  \nregional conventions or meetings of the Union, and  \nb. the period of absence may be used by not more than  \nseventy- five (75) employees at any one time in serving as  \nofficers or representatives of the Union outside the territory  \ndescribed in 3 above, and  \nc. the period of absence may be used by not more than forty  \n(40) employees at any one time to carry on activities of the  \nUnion concerning employees of other telephone companies  \nrepresented by the Union or not represented by any Union,  \nwithin the States or portions of States served by the Com-  \npanies.  \nA maximum of thirty (30) authorized representatives of the  \nUnion at any one time may use periods of excused time off or  \nleave of absence for such other activities as may be agreed to by  \nthe Companies.  \nRequests for leaves of absence for Union activities shall be made  \nin writing by the appropriate Officer of the National Union direct-  \ning District 9 of the Union or the Union\u2019s authorized representa-  \ntive, specifying the reasons for such leaves.  \nIt is agreed that the Companies have the right to terminate a  \nleave of absence at any time if it is used for purposes other than  \nthose specified in the written application.  \nRequests for excused absence shall be made by the Union repre-  \nsentatives authorized for such purpose in writing to the appro-  \npriate Labor Relations Director, by the appropriate Officer of the  \nNational Union directing District 9 of the Union. Such requests  \nmay also be made by any of the three (3) principal Officers of a  \nLocal. The Secretary or Secretary-Treasurer of each Local shall  \nfurnish a list of such Local Officers to the appropriate Labor  \n37  \n   \n10.  \nRelations Director and shall furnish amendments to such lists as  \nchanges are made.  \nThe Union shall make all requests for excused absences or leaves  \nof absence as far in advance as possible, ordinarily not less than  \nforty-eight (48) hours in advance of the time the employee is to  \nbe off on excused absence and ordinarily not less than two (2)  \nweeks in advance of the start of a leave of absence or renewal of  \nsame; the Companies shall act promptly on each request.  \nNo payment shall be made to an authorized Union representative  \nfor time spent in meetings with the Companies\u2019 representatives  \nwhile the Union representative is on an excused absence or leave  \nof absence.  \nNo employee shall take time off for Union activities unless  \nexcused in advance by supervision.  \nEXCUSED ABSENCES  \nI,  \nThe total of all excused absences granted to an authorized Union  \nrepresentative in each calendar year shall not exceed ninety (90)  \nscheduled working days, or the equivalent thereof, in full days  \nand/or fractional days. However, not more than one hundred fifty  \n(150) authorized representatives of the Union may be granted  \nexcused absences not to exceed one hundred fifty (150) sched-  \nuled working days, or the equivalent thereof, in full days and/or  \nfractional days.  \nA single period of excused absence shall not exceed thirty (30)  \nconsecutive calendar days.  \nMeeting with the Companies\u2019 representatives during a period of  \nexcused absence shall not be considered as breaking a continu-  \nous period of absence.  \nExcused absences under this Section will be considered as time-  \nworked for purposes of FMLA eligibility.  \nNOTE: The provisions of this Section 3.03B will not apply to an  \nemployee who accepts a Staff position with the  \nCommunications Workers of America (CWA).  \nLEAVES OF ABSENCE  \n1.  \nA leave of absence will be required:  \n38  \na. If acontinuous period of absence for Union activity exceeds  \nthirty (30) consecutive calendar days.  \nb. If an employee who is an authorized representative of the  \nUnion is to have time off for Union activities in excess of  \nninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150) scheduled working  \ndays computed as specified in Section 3.03B.  \nc. As of April 1, 2001, if an employee, who is an authorized  \nrepresentative of the Union, accepts a Staff position with the  \nCommunications Workers of America.  \nIf a leave of absence is granted because an employee\u2019s excused  \nabsences have exceeded ninety (90) or one hundred fifty (150)  \ndays computed as specified in Section 3.03B, the leave of  \nabsence shall be for a period beginning with the first scheduled  \nworking day after the last day worked and shall be for a period  \nof not less than thirty-one (31) days.  \nIf the leave of absence is granted because an employee accepts a  \nStaff position with the CWA, other than for a short-term tempo-  \nrary backfill, the leave of absence will be for a period beginning  \nwith the first scheduled working day after the effective date of the  \nCWA employment and will not be for a period of less than thirty-  \none (31) calendar days. The employee must remain on the leave  \nof absence until one of the following occurs:  \na. The employee\u2019s Staff position with the CWA is concluded  \nand the employee notifies the Companies, in accordance  \nwith Section 3.03D, of his/her intent to return to work within  \nthe time allowed under Section 3.03C7 of this agreement.  \nb. The employee would exceed the Union Leave of Absence  \ntime allowed under Section 3.03C7 of this agreement, at  \nwhich time the employee would notify the Companies, in  \naccordance with 3.03D, of his/her intent to return to work or  \nterminate his/her employment with the Companies.  \nThe general rules of the Companies governing leaves of absence  \nfor personal reasons shall apply except as changed herein.  \nAt no time shall more than one hundred (100) employees be on  \nleave of absence under this Article.  \n39  \n   \n10.  \nA leave of absence for Union activities or an extension of sucha  \nleave shall be for a period of not more than one (1) year each.  \nThe total cumulative period of leave-of-absence for Union busi-  \nness shall not exceed twenty-one (21) years, all of which shall be  \ncounted as service credit in terms of employment. The payment  \nof premiums for continuation of standard fringe benefits during  \na leave of absence for Union business shall be as follows:  \nMedical/Dental/Vision Companies pay  \nGroup Insurance Companies pay  \nPension Band Will be determined by the  \nemployee\u2019s last title and wage  \narea prior to the start of the most  \nrecent leave of absence for  \nUnion business updated to  \ncurrent comparable title and  \nwage area.  \nIn computing an employee\u2019s net credited service for all purposes  \nexcept wage progression, full credit shall be allowed for periods  \nof leaves of absence for Union activities not exceeding twenty-  \none (21) years in the aggregate during the employee\u2019s total ser-  \nvice life. No credit for any purpose shall be allowed for such  \nleaves in excess of twenty-one (21) years, nor shall credit be  \nallowed for wage progression purposes for any period covered by  \nleaves of absence granted pursuant to Section 3.03.  \nWhen the period of a leave of absence for Union activities is to  \nbe included in computing an employee\u2019s net credited service,  \nthe employee shall retain eligibility, if any, according to term of  \nservice, to:  \na. Death Benefits, and  \nb. Short-Term Disability Benefits.  \nIn determining such employee\u2019s eligibility to sickness  \ndisability benefits, the first day following termination of the  \nleave of absence shall be considered as the first day of  \nabsence because of sickness.  \nA leave of absence granted under this Article shall automatically  \nterminate if at any time the employee on leave engages in any  \n40  \ngainful occupation other than as a representative of the Union or  \nif the employee ceases to function as an authorized representative  \nof the Union.  \nD.

However, a leave shall be terminated at the  \nrequest of the employee prior to its stated expiration date as pro-  \nvided in this Paragraph only in case the employee is able on the  \nday of return to perform, on a full-time basis, the duties required  \nof such an employee.  \nSection 3.04 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MEETINGS  \nBETWEEN UNION AND MANAGEMENT  \nREPRESENTATIVES  \nA. The Companies will compensate up to four (4) authorized represen-  \ntatives of the Union, who are active employees covered by this  \nContract, for attending meetings with Management for the purpose of  \nnegotiating a written Contract. This compensation will be at the  \nemployee\u2019s basic straight time wage rate for scheduled workdays only  \nand will not include any differential payments. The total days paid by  \nthe Companies for each employee will not exceed forty-five (45). The  \nexpenses of all Union representatives will be borne by the Union.  \nTime spent in attending meetings with Management under this Section  \nwill not be considered time worked, except for the purpose of FMLA  \neligibility.  \n41  \n   \nSection 3.05 UNION ACTIVITIES ON THE  \nA.  \nCOMPANIES\u2019 PREMISES  \nAuthorized representatives of the Union may be granted access to the  \nCompanies\u2019 premises where employees covered by this Contract are  \nlocated upon application to the appropriate Company supervisor at the  \nlocation in question, subject to the Companies\u2019 practices and the  \nrequirements of Government regulations.  \nThe Union or its members shall not carry on any type of Union activ-  \nities on the Companies\u2019 premises, except as provided in Section 3.05C,  \nunless advance approval has been given by appropriate Company  \nsupervision for such activities. The Companies reserve the right to cur-  \ntail or prohibit any Union activity on any premises of the Companies  \nwhen, in their judgment, such activity is not in accordance with the  \napproval granted by appropriate Company supervision as provided in  \nthis Section 3.05B.  \nUnion activities involving the solicitation of members on the Compa-  \nnies\u2019 premises shall be carried on only in accordance with the  \nfollowing:  \n1. Union representatives may solicit members among employees of  \nthe Companies in the Areas now represented by this Union.  \n2. Such solicitation shall only be made during periods when neither  \nthe Union members nor the employees being solicited are on  \nCompany time, excluding paid rest and meal periods.  \n3. Such solicitation shall not be carried on in space where the Com-  \npanies\u2019 operations or administrative work is being performed.  \n4. Such solicitation shall be limited to small groups of employees  \n(not to exceed four (4)).  \n5. Such solicitation shall not interfere with the operations of the  \nCompanies or the use of the space for the purposes for which the  \nspace is intended.  \nAuthorized representatives of the Union may attend Union-Manage-  \nment meetings for the purposes of collective bargaining and discussing  \ngrievances presented to the Union by employees covered by this Con-  \ntract when such meetings have been suitably arranged for in advance.  \n42  \nSection 3.06 BULLETIN BOARDS  \nA.  \nUpon written request from the Union, the Companies agree to install  \nor to move bulletin boards for the exclusive use of the Union. Bulletin  \nboards and their designations shall be provided by the Union and shall  \nbe in accordance with the Companies\u2019 specifications. The size of the  \nbulletin boards shall be approximately 18\" x 36\", 24\" x 36\" or  \n12\" x 24\" in dimensions. The number and location of bulletin boards  \nshall be determined jointly by the Companies and the Union with due  \nregard to visibility and accessibility to employees for whom the Union  \nis the recognized representative. Each bulletin board shall be  \ndesignated specifically as follows:  \nUNION BULLETIN BOARD  \nLocal (Number), Communications Workers of America  \nLetters in such designation shall not be over 1-1/2\" high. The overall  \nsize of the designation shall not extend beyond the bulletin board  \nitself, or be more than 24\" long by 2\" high, and shall be in a horizontal  \nposition within 3\" of the top of the bulletin board.  \nUnless otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Companies, the  \nUnion agrees not to post or distribute Union material any place on the  \nCompanies\u2019 premises other than on Union bulletin boards. Unless  \notherwise agreed upon in advance by the Companies, the Union also  \nagrees that Union bulletin boards shall be used solely for notices and  \nannouncements concerning Union meetings, elections, appointments  \nto office, social, educational, or recreational affairs and agreements  \nconcluded between the Union and the Companies. Posted notices and  \nannouncements shall be appropriately identified as Union material  \nintended for posting and shall ordinarily bear the signature of an  \nauthorized representative of the Union. Should the Union desire to  \npost subject matter other than the material specified above, it shall  \nobtain advance approval from the Companies before such subject  \nmatter is posted.  \nMaterial posted shall not contain anything controversial or anything  \nderogatory to the Companies or any of their employees. The Union  \nassumes responsibility for complete compliance with the provisions  \nherein contained. Should the Union post material which, in the judg-  \nment of the Companies, is at variance with the spirit and intent of this  \n43  \n   \nSection, such material shall be immediately removed by the Union  \nupon notification by the Companies.  \nIf the Union violates any provision of Section 3.06B or Section 3.06C,  \nthe Companies, after giving due notice of such violation, may deny the  \nright of the Union to use any or all bulletin boards on the Companies\u2019  \npremises, and may remove any or all such bulletin boards.  \nSection 3.07 UNION SECURITY  \nA.  \nEach employee who is a member of the Union or who is obligated to  \ntender to the Union amounts equal to periodic dues on the effective  \ndate of this Contract, or who later becomes a member, and all employ-  \nees entering into the bargaining unit on or after the effective date of  \nthis Contract shall, as a condition of employment, pay or tender to the  \nUnion amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable to members for  \nthe period from such effective date or, in the case of employees enter-  \ning into the bargaining unit after the effective date, on or after the  \nthirtieth day after such entrance, whichever of these dates is later,  \nuntil the termination of this Contract. For purpose of this Section,  \n\u201cemployee\u201d shall mean any person entering into the bargaining unit,  \nexcept an Occasional employee.  \nEach employee who is a member of the bargaining unit on or before  \nthe effective date of this Agreement and who on the effective date of  \nthis Agreement was not required as a condition of employment to pay  \nor tender to the Union amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable  \nto members shall, as a condition of employment, pay or tender to the  \nUnion amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable to members for  \nthe period beginning thirty (30) days after the effective date of this  \nAgreement, until the termination of this Agreement.  \nThe condition of employment specified above shall not apply during  \nperiods of formal separation from the bargaining unit by any such  \nemployee but shall reapply to such employee on the thirtieth day  \nfollowing the employee\u2019s return to the bargaining unit. The term  \n\u201cformal separation\u201d includes transfers out of the bargaining unit,  \nremoval from the payroll of the Companies and leaves of absence of  \nmore than one month duration.  \nThe Companies may inform employees and applicants for employ-  \nment of their rights and obligations under the provisions of this  \nSection.  \n44  \nThis Section shall apply only in the State of California on the effec-  \ntive date of this Contract. If during the term of this Contract the Union  \nshall become duly authorized under the laws of the State of Nevada to  \nenter into this type of union security agreement, the effective date of  \nthis Section as to employees in Nevada shall be the date upon which  \nthe Companies receive proper written evidence from the Union that it  \nis fully qualified to enter into such an agreement in Nevada. Upon  \nproper written notification that the Union is qualified to enter into a  \nunion security agreement, this entire Section will become applicable  \nto employees in Nevada.  \nSection 3.08 PAYROLL DEDUCTION OF UNION DUES  \nA.  \nThe Companies agree that, upon receipt of an individual written  \nrequest on a form approved by the Companies and signed by an  \nemployee covered by this Contract, they will deduct monthly from  \nsuch employee\u2019s wages the amount of Union dues specified in such  \nrequest and forward the full amount thus deducted to the Secretary-  \nTreasurer of the Union or the Union\u2019s authorized agent as directed.  \n1. For all employees of the Companies in California, the request  \nmay be revoked at any time upon the employee\u2019s written request  \nto the Company and such request should be directed to the Labor  \nRelations Director, San Ramon, as appropriate. For employees of  \nthe Companies in Nevada who currently have executed dues  \ndeduction cards on file, the dues deduction request may be  \nrevoked at any time upon the employee\u2019s written request to the  \nCompany and such request should be directed to the Labor Rela-  \ntions Director, San Ramon. For employees of the Companies in  \nNevada who execute dues deduction cards as described in Sec-  \ntion 3.08E after the effective date of this bargaining agreement,  \ncancellation of payroll deduction authorizations will be made as  \nspecified in Section 3.08E.  \n2. In general, dues deductions will be made in a designated pay-  \nperiod in the current month for properly executed dues deduction  \nauthorizations received in the appropriate Accounting Center on  \nor before the fifth day of the preceding month. However, the  \nCompanies assume no responsibility either to the employee or to  \nthe Union for any failure to make or for any errors made in  \n45  \n   \nmaking such deductions, but will make such efforts as they deem  \nappropriate in correcting any such errors or omissions.  \nAuthorizations for dues deductions shall be \u201copen-ended\u201d to provide  \nfor the deduction of dues in an amount which is certified to the Com-  \npanies in writing by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Union as being the  \nregular monthly membership dues of the particular Local involved.  \nThe form of such individual authorization card shall be as approved by  \nthe Companies.  \nThe written certification changing the amount of dues to be deducted  \nmust be delivered to the Executive Director - Labor Relations on or  \nbefore the fifth work day of the month preceding the month in which  \nthe first deduction at the new rate is to be made effective, together with  \na list of the work locations and Union Local affected by the change.  \nThe Companies agree to furnish the Union at the time of remitting the  \ndues deducted, a list, on magnetic tape, of the names of those employ-  \nees represented by the Union and the amount of dues deducted. The  \ncontent and form of other employee information to be furnished to the  \nUnion on magnetic tape shall be such as agreed upon by the parties  \nfrom time to time.  \nThe following Section applies only to employees in Nevada. Autho-  \nrizations for dues deductions executed pursuant to Article 3.08A after  \nAugust 6, 1989 shall specify that dues deductions may be revoked  \nonly within the fourteen (14) day period immediately prior to each  \nanniversary of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement or during  \nthe fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the termination date of the  \nCollective Bargaining Agreement.  \nCancellations by employees of such written payroll deduction author-  \nizations must be in writing and such cancellation requests must be sent  \nindividually by certified mail to the Labor Relations Director, San  \nRamon, postmarked or received during the fourteen (14) day period  \ndescribed in 3.08E. After receipt of such cancellation the Company  \nwill discontinue the payroll deduction in the month following that in  \nwhich the cancellation is received and will notify the Union of the  \naction taken.  \nCancellation of dues deduction authorizations will be made by the  \nCompanies on the permanent transfer or promotion of an employee to  \nan ineligible position effective the first payroll period following the  \n46  \ntransfer or promotion and the Companies will notify the Union of  \nsuch cancellation.  \nIt is agreed that the payroll deduction of Union dues shall be in lieu of  \nUnion collection of dues, assessments and contributions on the  \nCompanies\u2019 premises where work operations are being performed and  \nwhile Union representatives and/or the employees involved are on  \nCompany time.  \nThe Union shall indemnify and hold the Companies harmless against  \nany and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that may  \narise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Compa-  \nnies for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Article,  \nor in reliance on any dues deduction card furnished under the  \nprovisions of this Article or on any certification by the Union.  \nSection 3.09 NON-DISCRIMINATION  \nA.  \nIn a desire to restate their respective policies, neither the Companies  \nnor the Union shall unlawfully discriminate against any employee  \nbecause of such employee\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, age, marital sta-  \ntus, sexual orientation, or national origin or because the person is dis-  \nabled, a special disabled veteran, a disabled veteran or a veteran of the  \nVietnam era.  \nThe Companies and the Union recognize that potential conflicts may  \narise between obligations under the Americans With Disabilities Act  \n(ADA) and the terms of the Contract. In order to minimize disputes  \nbetween the Companies and the Union due to any such potential con-  \nflicts and to ensure timely resolution, the parties agree that all issues  \nregarding actions which the Companies believe to be consistent with  \nthe ADA and the Union believes to be in conflict with the Contract will  \nbe referred to and addressed by a National Union Representative, a  \nrepresentative from the affected Union Local, the Labor Relations  \nDirector (or authorized representative) and a representative from the  \naffected Company department (\u201cADA Liaison  \n1. The ADA Liaison Committee is empowered to resolve any issues  \nor problems regarding a potential conflict between obligations  \nunder the ADA and the terms of this Contract.  \n2. Agreements made by the ADA Liaison Committee will not prej-  \nudice the position of either party and will not be cited in any other  \n47  \n   \nproceeding. Such agreements will not be subject to the grievance  \nand arbitration process.  \n3. Unresolved issues or problems regarding potential conflicts will  \nnot delay or defer the Companies\u2019 actions. If the ADA Liaison  \nCommittee is unable to resolve a dispute, the issue(s) regarding  \nappropriate actions under the ADA and the Contract may then be  \naddressed under the arbitration provisions of the Contract. To  \nensure timely resolution of such disputes, the grievance proce-  \ndure shall be bypassed and the matter may be submitted directly  \nto arbitration.  \nC. It is mutually agreed that neither party shall interfere with, restrain,  \ncoerce, or otherwise discriminate against employees in their right to  \njoin or assist, or refrain from joining or assisting, any labor organiza-  \ntion.  \nD. The Companies shall not interfere with, restrain, coerce, intimidate or  \notherwise discriminate against any employee because of membership  \nor lawful activity in forwarding the interests or purposes of the Union.  \nSection 3.10 FEDERAL OR STATE LAWS  \nIn the event any Federal or State law or regulation or governmental order,  \nor the final decision of any court or board of competent jurisdiction affects  \nany one or more provisions of this Contract, the provision or provisions so  \naffected shall be made to comply with the requirements of such law, regu-  \nlation, governmental order, or decision for the localities within the juris-  \ndiction and otherwise the Contract shall continue in full force and effect.  \n48  \n"], ["ARTICLE 4  \nJOB TITLES AND CLASSIFICATIONS  \nSection 4.01 NEW JOB TITLES AND JOB  \n", "A.  \nCLASSIFICATIONS  \nWhenever the Companies determine it appropriate to create a new job  \n(1.e., a new title or use of a current job title for a new position being  \nestablished in a fifth level organization or next lower level organiza-  \ntion if no fifth level organization exists), in the bargaining unit, during  \nthe life of the contract, they shall proceed as follows:  \n1.  \nThe Companies will notify the Union before an Occupational Job  \nEvaluation (OJE) is conducted, including the reason for the OJE,  \nthe rationale behind the request, the number of incumbents (pro-  \nposed) and work location(s) (proposed). Following such notice to  \nthe Union, the Companies may proceed to complete the OJE and  \nestablish a provisional job title and wage schedule.  \nThe Companies will notify the Union of the provisional job title  \nand wage schedule that is established. Following such notice to  \nthe Union, the Companies may proceed to staff such job title at  \nthe determined wage schedule. The Companies will conduct a  \nfollow-up review to assess whether the provisional rating remains  \nappropriate. The follow-up review will occur no less than six (6)  \nmonths after staffing. After the Companies\u2019 follow-up review is  \ncompleted, the Union will be notified. Notification will include  \nthe specific justifications for the recommended title(s) and/or  \nwage schedule(s).  \nWhenever the Companies, during the life of the Contract, determine  \nit appropriate to reclassify a job title or wage schedule because the job  \ncontent of an existing job has changed due to new technology or func-  \ntionalization they shall proceed as follows:  \n1.  \nThe Companies will notify the Union before an Occupational Job  \nEvaluation (OJE) is conducted, including the reason for the OJE,  \nthe rationale behind the request, the number of incumbents (exist-  \ning) and work location(s) (existing). Following such notice to the  \nUnion, the Companies may proceed to complete the OJE and  \nreclassify the job title or wage schedule.  \n49  \n   \n2. The Companies will notify the Union of any reclassification of  \nthe title or the wage schedule including the specific justifications  \nused to make the determination leading to such reclassifica-  \ntion(s). Following such notice to the Union, the Companies may  \nproceed to staff such job title or classification. Wage Adminis-  \ntrative practices in Appendix C, Section(s) C8.02 and C8.04,  \nrespectively, will be applied for upgraded or lateral reclassifica-  \ntions, however, step down from maximum referenced in  \nC8.02C and D will not apply to upgrades. The Job Evaluation  \nTransition Pay Plan (JETPP) Memorandum of Agreement will be  \napplied for reclassifications resulting in a downgrade. Any title or  \nwage schedule change will be effective with the next payroll  \nperiod following notification to the Department.  \nNOTE: No other reclassification of existing jobs will occur  \nduring the life of this Contract; rather any such reclassi-  \nfications will normally be negotiated during bargaining.  \nThe Companies agree to meet with the Union upon the Union\u2019s  \nrequest to discuss any aspect of the job evaluation process which led  \nto the Companies\u2019 decision regarding the recommended title and/or  \nwage schedule, including the rationale used by the Companies to  \narrive at the Companies\u2019 recommended title and/or wage schedule.  \nWithin thirty (30) calendar days from the Union\u2019s receipt of the Sec-  \ntion 4.01B2 reclassification notice or no later than thirty (30) calendar  \ndays from the Union\u2019s receipt of the Section follow-up notice,  \nthe Union shall have the right to initiate negotiations concerning the  \nwage rates or schedules established or changed by the Companies.  \nIf negotiations are not so initiated within the thirty (30) calendar day  \nperiods described in Section 4.01D or if agreement is reached between  \nthe parties concerning the wage rates and schedules within sixty (60)  \ncalendar days following receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up  \nnotice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the wage rates and  \nschedules set by the Companies or agreed to by the Parties, shall  \nremain in effect.  \nIf negotiations are so initiated pursuant to Section 4.01D and if the par-  \nties are unable to reach agreement on the schedule of wage rates  \nwithin sixty (60) calendar days following the Union\u2019s receipt of the  \nSection 4.01A2 follow-up notice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification  \nnotice, the Union must notify the Companies in writing of its intention  \n50  \nto submit the issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates to a Neu-  \ntral Third Party for resolution, to be selected as set forth in Section  \n4.01G.  \nNOTE: The Union\u2019s written notice shall specify the wage schedule  \nthe Union believes should be assigned to the job in question  \nand the reasons why.  \nIf such notification is not received by the Companies within sixty (60)  \ndays of the Union\u2019s receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice or  \nthe Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the matter shall be consid-  \nered settled in the Companies\u2019 favor and shall not be subject to further  \nhandling under this procedure, nor may the issue be submitted to the  \nproblem resolution, grievance and arbitration procedures.  \nThe Neutral Third Party previously referred to shall be selected by  \nmutual agreement of the parties from a panel of six (6) arbitrators  \nselected for their expertise in the field of job evaluation.  \nThe members of the panel may be changed by mutual agreement of the  \nparties. Though the panel members will normally receive first con-  \nsideration, the parties reserve the right to jointly select a Neutral Third  \nParty outside of the panel to serve on an ad hoc basis.  \n1. The Neutral Third Party will render a written decision within  \nfifteen (15) working days after the hearing.  \n2. The Neutral Third Party is empowered to decide only whether the  \nwage schedule assigned by the Companies or the wage schedule  \nrequested by the Union is the appropriate wage schedule.  \n3. The Neutral Third Party is not empowered to assign a wage  \nschedule and title classification that is not currently contained in  \nthe collective bargaining agreement or to render a decision on any  \nother issues.  \n4. The Neutral Third Party shall have no authority to add to, subtract  \nfrom, or modify any provisions of the collective bargaining  \nagreement.  \nThe procedures set forth in Section 4.01 shall be the exclusive means  \nby which the Union may dispute the schedule of wage rates which the  \nCompanies set for any new, restructured or redefined job title or clas-  \nsification established by Section(s) 4.01A and B. Disputes regarding  \njob classifications which are not governed by this Section 4.01 may be  \n51  \n   \npursued under the Problem Resolution Procedures set forth in  \nArticle 7.  \nSection 4.02 ASSIGNING TITLES  \nA.  \nThe assignment of particular titles to employees with titles listed in  \nAppendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01, A3.01 and A4.01 and Appendix  \nB, does not mean that they shall perform only the kind of work com-  \ning under their title classification, nor that certain kinds of work shall  \nbe performed exclusively by certain classifications of employees.  \nExcept as provided for in Appendix A, Sections A3.05B and C an  \nemployee assigned to work falling in a higher wage group (other than  \nwork incidental to the lower classification) shall, during the period the  \nemployee is assigned to work falling in a higher wage group, be  \nassigned a title in the wage group in which the employee works a  \ngreater part of the normal workweek for a period of one week or  \nmore.  \nEmployees who are regularly assigned to work coming under more  \nthan one (1) title classification listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01  \nand A2.01, or Appendix B, which carry identical wages and working  \nconditions, shall be classified under the title which covers the work on  \nwhich they are engaged for the greater part of the time.  \nSection 4.03 PART-TIME, TERM, TEMPORARY AND  \nA.  \nOCCASIONAL EMPLOYEES  \nPART-TIME EMPLOYEES  \nA part-time employee is one who is employed and normally scheduled  \nto work less hours per average month than a comparable full-time  \nemployee in the same job title, classification and work group working  \nthe same normal daily tour. Treatment of a part-time employee under  \nthe Companies\u2019 benefit plans and payment programs is dependent on  \nthe employee\u2019s \u201caverage workweek\u201d and whether the employee is  \n\u201cgrandfathered.\u201d  \n1. \u201cGRANDFATHERED\u201d PART-TIME EMPLOYEES  \na. Certain part-time employees shall be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d as  \nfollows:  \n1. Regular part-time employees who were on the active  \npayroll of the Companies as of December 31, 1980  \n52  \nand who were classified as part-time on August 9, 1992  \nshall be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d so long as they continue to be  \nclassified as part-time; and  \n2. Regular employees who were on the active payroll of  \nthe Companies as of December 31, 1980, who were  \nclassified as full-time on August 9, 1992, and who  \nbecome classified as part-time as a result of surplus in  \nwhich there are no Regular commutable full-time jobs  \navailable for which they are qualified, shall be \u201cgrand-  \nfathered\u201d so long as they continue to be classified as  \npart-time, unless and until such time as they have been  \noffered, and have rejected, the opportunity to be placed  \nin a commutable Regular full-time job.  \n\u201cGrandfathered\u201d employees shall, during the applicable  \nterm of part-time employment, receive payments under ben-  \nefit plans and payment programs on the same basis as was  \napplicable to part-time employees on December 31, 1980.  \nALL OTHER PART-TIME EMPLOYEES  \nAll part-time employees who are not \u201cgrandfathered\u201d shall  \nreceive payments under the Companies\u2019 benefit plans and  \npayment programs as described in this section.  \na.  \nPart-time employees who are not \u201cgrandfathered\u201d include,  \nbut are not limited to:  \n1. Employees who were on the active payroll of the Com-  \npanies as of December 31, 1980 and who were not  \nclassified as part-time on August 9, 1992; and  \n2. Regular part-time employees who were hired or  \nrehired on or after January 1, 1981.  \nWhen an employee begins working part-time the \u201caverage  \nworkweek\u201d will be determined in advance by dividing the  \nemployee\u2019s normally expected scheduled hours per month  \nby 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole  \nnumber. (For example: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35  \nequals 15.6, rounded to an average workweek of 16 hours).  \nThis \u201caverage workweek\u201d will apply until an employee has  \nworked a full calendar quarter as a part-time employee.  \n93  \n   \nAfter an employee has worked a full calendar quarter as a  \npart-time employee, the \u201caverage workweek\u201d will be rede-  \ntermined as of the end of each calendar quarter during which  \nthe employee was classified as a part-time employee for the  \nentire quarter. The \u201caverage workweek\u201d for the following  \nquarter will be determined by averaging all hours worked  \nduring the prior quarter. This average includes:  \n(1) Hours worked up to a maximum of eight (8) per day or  \nforty (40) per week; and  \n(2) Hours scheduled or assigned to be worked but excused,  \npaid or unpaid.  \n(3) The total of (1) & (2) above will be limited to a maxi-  \nmum of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) per week.  \nFor periods of service as a part-time employee after January  \n1, 1993, proration calculations for wages or service for each  \nof the following benefit plans and payment programs will be  \nbased on the relationship of the individual part-time  \nemployee\u2019s \u201caverage workweek\u201d to a forty (40) hour  \nworkweek:  \nPension Plan  \nComprehensive Disability Benefit Plan  \nLife Insurance Plans  \nSavings Plan  \nSeverance Plans  \nVacation, Holiday and Paid Personal Days Off  \nSickness Absence Payments  \nTeam Performance Award  \nThe revised calculation method will not apply retroactively,  \nand employees receiving disability benefits under the Com-  \nprehensive Disability Benefits Plan, sickness absence pay-  \nments, or vacation payments on January 1, 1993 will  \ncontinue to receive the same level of benefits until their  \neligibility for such benefits or payments expires.  \nMonthly contributions to the Medical, Dental and Vision  \nPlans will be prorated using the same percentage calculated  \nin Section 4.03A2b or 4.03A2c as applicable. The Compa-  \nnies will pay that percent of the cost of coverage for  \n54  \nMedical, Dental and Vision care. The part-time employee  \nwill pay the difference between the Company contributions  \nand the cost of the plan.  \n3. A part-time employee shall not be paid Sickness Absence pay-  \nments under Section 5.01F unless such absence due to sickness  \noccurs on a day of the week on which the employee is normally  \nscheduled to work and a full-time employee in the same circum-  \nstance would be paid.  \nTERM EMPLOYEES:  \nTerm employees are those engaged for a specific project or limited  \nperiod with the definite understanding that their employment is to ter-  \nminate upon completion of the project or at the end of the period.  \nEmployment is expected to continue for more than one (1) year, but  \nno more than three (3) years. Term employees are covered by all  \nprovisions of this Contract except where otherwise provided.  \nTerm employees are not to be assigned work which would directly  \nresult in the surplus or layoff of Regular employees in the same title  \nand administrative unit to which they are assigned.  \nTEMPORARY EMPLOYEES  \n1. Temporary employees are those engaged for a specific project or  \na limited period, with the definite understanding that their  \nemployment is to terminate upon completion of the project or at  \nthe end of the period, and whose employment is expected to con-  \ntinue for more than three consecutive weeks but not for more than  \none year.  \n2. All Temporary employees shall be advised of their employment  \nstatus and all pertinent information related thereto at the time of  \nhiring.  \n3. All provisions of this Contract shall apply to Temporary  \nemployees, except where otherwise provided.  \n4. Should the term of employment of a Temporary employee exceed  \none year, then the employee will be reclassified to a Term  \nemployee effective with the first day following the completion of  \none year.  \na. The maximum term of employment for a Temporary  \nemployee who is reclassified to Term under the provisions  \n95  \n   \nof this Section 4.03C4 will be three (3) years from the date  \nof hiring as a Temporary employee.  \nb. A Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under  \nthe provisions of this Section 4.03C4 will be eligible for  \nTerm employee benefits as described in Section 4.03E from  \nthe time of reclassification.  \nc. A Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under  \nthe provisions of this Section 4.03C4 will be eligible for  \nvacation and Personal Days Off in accordance with the pro-  \nvisions of Article 6, Sections 6.02A1 and 6.04 applicable to  \nTerm employees, from the date of reclassification. How-  \never, nothing in this Section will cause such a reclassified  \nemployee to receive more vacation or Personal Days Off  \nthan they would have received had they been classified as a  \nTerm employee from the date of hiring as a Temporary  \nemployee.  \nOCCASIONAL EMPLOYEES  \nAn Occasional employee is one who is engaged on a daily basis for a  \nperiod of not more than three (3) consecutive weeks, or for a cumula-  \ntive total of not more than thirty (30) days, in any calendar year,  \nregardless of the length of the daily or weekly assignments.

Employees in titles listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01,  \nA4.01 or Appendix B shall be paid at their weekly basic rate of pay for  \nforty (40) hours of work. Employees in titles listed in Appendix A,  \nSection A3.01 shall be paid at the basic rate per week as established  \nfor their respective title classifications. The wage schedules and top  \nrates of pay shall be as stated in Appendix C3 of this Contract.  \nIn any case where a Company building is located upon property which  \nlies within two (2) exchanges, and if such exchanges are classified dif-  \nferently for wage rate purposes, any employee who is regularly  \nassigned to report for work in such a Company building shall be paid  \nat the wage rate that pertains to the higher exchange classification.  \nB. Except as provided in Section 5.01D, wage increases in the amounts  \nshown in the schedules shall be granted automatically on completion  \nof the time intervals specified.  \n1. No wage increase shall become effective during a period of  \nabsence in excess of seven (7) calendar days, paid vacations  \nexcepted.  \na. Aperiod of absence of seven (7) calendar days or less shall  \nhave no effect on the establishment of the effective date of  \nincrease.  \nb. If the effective date for a scheduled increase occurs during  \na period of absence in excess of seven (7) calendar days, but  \nnot to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, the increase will  \nbecome effective on the day the employee returns to work.  \nSuch adjustment in the effective date of this increase shall  \nnot change the date from which the time interval for the next  \nincrease would otherwise be computed.  \nc. If the effective date for a scheduled increase occurs during  \na period of absence of over thirty (30) calendar days, the first  \nthirty (30) calendar days of such absence shall be credited  \nto the employee\u2019s previously accrued time on the wage  \n59  \n   \n2s  \nprogression schedule and the increase shall become effec-  \ntive either on the day the employee returns to work if the  \nemployee has been credited with the necessary time interval  \nfor the next increase, or after the employee has worked the  \nremainder of the applicable wage progression time interval.  \nIn no case shall the application of the provisions of this Section  \n5.01B operate to make an increase effective on a date earlier  \nthan would have resulted had no absence occurred.  \nWhen an employee is absent for more than thirty (30) consecutive cal-  \nendar days, only the first thirty (30) calendar days of such absence  \nshall be credited to the employee\u2019s previously accrued total schedule  \ntime on the wage schedule.  \nFLEXIBLE STARTING RATES  \n1.  \nWhen, in the judgment of the Companies, an increase becomes  \ndesirable in starting rates for any or all title classifications in a  \nparticular exchange listed in Appendix C4 of this Contract, the  \nCompanies will so notify the Union and will discuss with the  \nUnion both the starting rate and method of progression from the  \nnew starting rate to the particular existing schedule.  \nIf the Union and the Companies reach an agreement thereon, the  \nschedule for such title classification or title classifications  \nbetween the points where the old schedule is reached and the  \nmaximum rate, as well as the overall schedule length, will remain  \nunchanged; and the employees to whom such altered schedule  \napplies will be placed on the altered schedule with the same total  \nschedule time they had on the previous schedule.  \nIf the Companies and the Union fail to reach agreement within  \nfifteen (15) days after the above date of notification of said pro-  \nposal, such schedule shall remain unchanged.  \nThe Companies may discontinue or reduce the amount of such  \nincreased starting rates at any time but such discontinuance or  \nreduction shall not cause a decrease in the wage rate of any  \nemployee whose wage rate was increased under Subparagraph 1  \nor 2 of this Section 5.01D. The application of this Subparagraph  \n4 shall not result in starting rates lower than those on the old  \nschedule.  \n60  \nAn employee hired with previous wage experience credit, military  \nservice, technical training, typing or key punch skills useful to the  \nCompanies shall be granted wage credit in accordance with the wage  \ncredit practice agreement.  \nAll employees with at least one (1) year of service shall be paid for  \nsickness absence beginning with the first scheduled working day of  \nabsence. Sickness absence payments shall be limited to a maximum of  \nfive (5) days in the seven (7) day period.  \n1. The scheduled working days referred to in this Section 5.01F  \nshall be computed in accordance with the pattern of scheduled  \ndays of the workweek in which the sickness absence first  \noccurred regardless of the number of scheduled workdays in that  \nweek. This pattern shall be deemed to continue into all subse-  \nquent workweeks of such absence for determining work time  \nlost and days for which sickness absence should be paid.  \n2. Sickness absence shall not be deemed to continue into the second  \nworkweek unless such absence includes the first scheduled day  \nof the original work schedule for the second week.  \nWhen employees report on the job for duty on a scheduled day and  \nsubsequently become sick and are excused by the supervisor before  \ncompletion of their tour of duty, they will be paid at straight time for  \nthe remainder of the full tour of duty for which scheduled.  \nSickness absence payments referred to in Sections 5.01F and 5.01G  \nabove shall include any shift or job differentials which the employee  \nwould have received had the employee worked, but shall not include  \nany extra payments which would have been received had the  \nemployee worked, such as Sunday, holiday, or overtime extra  \npayments.  \nThe supervisor shall decide whether employees with titles listed in  \nAppendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01 or Appendix B, shall work or be  \nexcused from duty because of bad weather conditions. If the supervi-  \nsor decides that the employees cannot work, they shall be paid for the  \nbalance of the half-tour that they were excused from duty. If the  \nemployees are notified at or before noon, no payment will be made for  \nthe afternoon. Employees who do not report for duty shall not be paid  \nunder the provisions of this Section.  \n61  \n   \nWhen an employee in titles listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01, is  \ntransferred from night work to day or evening work at management\u2019s  \nrequest and loses a day\u2019s work opportunity because of the transfer,  \nwage payment shall be made for the day lost at straight-time at the  \nemployee\u2019s normal rate of pay.  \nEmployees shall be paid bi-weekly, payment of wages due for the two-  \nweek pay-period to be made when practicable not later than the Friday  \nfollowing the last day of the pay-period. When practicable, paychecks  \nshall be distributed in sufficient time to permit employees to cash  \ntheir checks within normal banking hours on the regular pay day.  \nSection 5.02 RELIEF DIFFERENTIALS  \nA.  \nA fixed relief differential of eight dollars ($8.00) a day will be paid to  \nany employee in any title who, in addition to normal duties or in the  \nperformance of a new assignment, temporarily relieves or assists a  \nmanager for a half tour or more. These assignments may involve plan-  \nning, distributing, directing, coordinating and training responsibilities  \nother than induction or orientation.

Anemployee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01 or  \nA2.01 shall receive a shift differential in the amount of ten (10)  \npercent of the employee\u2019s weekly basic rate of pay, except that  \nwhen premium payments are paid for a temporary change of  \nshift in accordance with Appendix A, Section A1.05D, or A2.03F  \nas appropriate, a shift differential will not be paid.  \n62  \nNote: An employee who works a scheduled shift on a Sunday or  \nHoliday, any part of which falls after 7:00 P.M. or prior to  \n6:00 A.M., shall receive a shift differential without regard  \nto his/her regular shift.  \na. The shift differential shall be added to the basic rate of pay  \nand the combined rate shall be used in computing vacation  \npayments, overtime payments, holiday payments and  \nSunday payments, except that the differential shall not be  \nadded in computing the vacation pay of a regular day shift  \nemployee who, at the start of vacation, had been working a  \ntour for which a differential is paid but who, upon return  \nfrom vacation, is scheduled to work a day shift for a period  \nof one (1) week or more.  \nb. When only a part of the week is involved, the differential  \nshall be prorated on the basis of a five (5) day week, that is,  \none (1) day\u2019s differential is one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly  \ndifferential.  \nc. An employee receiving a differential who is temporarily  \nassigned to a day shift in connection with training assign-  \nments, vacation reliefs or training reliefs for a period of one  \n(1) week or more but less than two (2) weeks shall retain the  \nshift differential but shall not receive premium pay for the  \nchange of shift.

The shift differential shall be for a full-time week of five (5)  \nshifts. When an employee works less than a full-time week  \nof five (5) shifts to which a differential is applicable, the  \nshift differential will be prorated; that is, one-fifth (1/5) of  \nthe weekly differential will be paid for each full shift  \nworked for which the differential is provided in Section  \n5.03A2.  \nB. An employee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A3.01A or  \nA3.01C who works an early morning, evening or night tour of duty  \nshall receive a wage differential in an amount specified in Appendix  \nC, for the appropriate unit, applying as shown in Appendix A, Section  \nA3.05.

The  \ndifferential will be added to the basic wage rate in computing vacation,  \novertime, holiday, Sunday and Personal Days Off.  \nSection 5.04 OVERTIME AND CALL-OUTS (For Pacific Bell  \nHome Entertainment, see Appendix B,  \nSection B2.05)  \nA. The provisions of this Section apply to all employees unless otherwise  \nspecified. Refer to Appendix A for additional overtime and premium  \npayments provisions.  \nB.

A leave of  \nabsence for personal reasons is a privilege which may be granted to  \nemployees rather than a right to which they are entitled. Granting a  \nleave of absence for a period of over thirty (30) days does not guar-  \nantee the employee will be given a position when the leave expires  \nunless agreed to in writing at the time the leave is granted.  \nSection 6.06 PLANNED TIME OFF  \nThe scheduling of planned time off will be in seniority order within indi-  \nvidual work groups. It is the intent of the parties that employees\u2019 selections  \nwill be granted to the extent practicable consistent with force requirements  \nand the needs of the service.  \nA.  \nScheduling of planned time off will be administered by seniority as  \nfollows:  \n1. Vacation \u2014 full week  \n2.  Vacation/Personal Day Off \u2014 day-at-a-time  \n3. Personal Day Off \u2014 two (2) hour increments  \nVacation schedules will be prepared by the Companies for each occu-  \npational and administrative unit except as provided in Section 6.06B1.  \nThe selection of vacation dates within each schedule will be on the  \nbasis of net credited service as shown by the records of the Companies,  \nexcept as provided elsewhere in this Section or unless otherwise  \nagreed to.  \n79  \n   \n1. Prior to the preparation of vacation schedules for any vacation  \nyear, the district level representative of the Companies will meet  \nwith the President and his or her designated representative of the  \nUnion Local involved to discuss the appropriate employee  \ngroups, comprising the employees within the district level\u2019s juris-  \ndiction, for which such schedules shall be prepared. In the event  \nof failure to reach agreement, final determination of the appro-  \npriate employee groups shall be made by the Department Head  \nor the Department Head\u2019s authorized representative.  \n2. Each employee in the bargaining unit defined in Appendix A,  \nSection A2.01, except Operations Administrator, Data Adminis-  \ntrator, Nevada employees and in other bargaining units as agreed  \nto by the parties, will have a first choice before anyone who  \nsplits their vacation makes a second choice. Employees detailed  \nto work away from headquarters will at their request be returned  \nto their headquarters at the Companies\u2019 expense for one vacation  \nperiod only, during each vacation year.  \n3. An employee transferred at management direction will retain  \nany vacation period(s) previously scheduled and approved.  \n4. When an employee-initiated transfer occurs, management will  \nendeavor to accommodate previously scheduled vacation periods  \nwithin the vacation schedule of the employee\u2019s new work group,  \ndue regard being given to the needs of the service and the indi-  \nvidual circumstances of each case.  \nVacation relief assignments for employees listed in Appendix A, Sec-  \ntions A1.01, A2.01 and Appendix B, will be posted at the time work  \nschedules are posted. This procedure will not apply to relief assign-  \nments for day-at-a-time vacations.  \nPrior to the beginning of the vacation year, management will canvass  \nthe work group to allow the employees to select vacation and Personal  \nDays off from available dates. The period during which vacation and  \nPersonal Days Off can be chosen by seniority rights will cover the 15  \nmonths from December 31st of the current year through March of the  \nsubsequent vacation year.  \nRequests to reschedule Personal Days Off will be made with normally  \nnot less than 48 hours\u2019 notice. The rescheduling is subject to manage-  \nment approval.  \n80  \nRequests for a Personal Day Off in two (2) hour increments may be  \nrequested by the employee, as needed, and will be granted to the  \nextent practicable consistent with force requirements and needs of the  \nservice.  \nIt is recommended that all employees take at least 10 days off (vaca-  \ntion/Personal Days Off) in the vacation year earned for the sake of  \ntheir well being.  \nNo work will be scheduled on a vacation day or Personal Day Off. A  \nvacation week is a calendar week, Sunday through Saturday. When an  \nemployee\u2019s vacation period spans a full week, no work will be sched-  \nuled the Saturday prior to, or Sunday following, the vacation week.  \nAll vacation may be taken in increments of less than a full week.  \nA vacation week of the new year may begin on Sunday of the same  \nweek in which December 31 falls on or before Wednesday.  \nVacation weeks and Personal Days Off carried over from the previous  \nvacation year through March 31 of the subsequent vacation year have  \nprecedence over selection of current year Time Off only in the first  \nthree (3) months of the vacation year. Any Time Off carried over from  \none vacation year to the next and not taken by the last day of March  \nwill be secondary in terms of scheduling to the selection of time off for  \nthe current vacation year.  \nPayment will be made in lieu of all vacation and Personal Days Off  \ncarried over from the previous vacation year which are not taken by  \nDecember 30 of the following vacation year.  \nThe Companies will not pay any expenses including per diem and  \nlodging incurred by employees when they take individual vacation  \ndays or Personal Days Off while working at a non-commutable tem-  \nporary work location.  \nWhen employees return to work from sickness or accident disability,  \nand they have not taken all vacation and/or Personal Days Off for  \nwhich eligible for the vacation year, they may take whatever can be  \naccommodated within the remainder of the current vacation year  \nthrough the end of the next vacation year. Time off carried over from  \nthe previous vacation year, and taken during the first quarter of the  \nnext vacation year under this provision will take precedence over  \nvacation selection for the current vacation year, but will be secondary  \nto vacation carried over under the provisions of Section 6.06K.  \n81  \n   \nEmployees going on a leave of absence may receive pay in lieu of  \nvacation they are eligible to receive or take the vacation upon their  \nreturn. Should the employee return during the same 24 month period  \nin which time off can be taken, he or she will receive whatever vaca-  \ntion and Personal Days Off that can be accommodated during the  \nremainder of the period. Payment will be made in lieu of any time off  \nnot used.  \nIndividuals leaving the employ of the Company shall receive payment  \nin lieu of vacation and Personal Days Off to which they are eligible  \nprovided they have worked during the vacation year and have not had  \nall of the vacation and Personal Days Off to which they are eligible  \nduring such period. This includes pro-rata payment of earned vacation  \nfor those employees who terminate with less than one year of service.  \nFor purposes of tracking or making payment in lieu of vacation or  \nPersonal Days Off, all time off earned in the previous vacation year  \nmust be taken before any time off for the current vacation year can be  \ntaken. For scheduling purposes, all other Paragraphs in this Section,  \n6.06, shall apply.  \n82  \n"], ["ARTICLE 7  \nPROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCEDURES  \n", "Section 7.01 The Companies and the Union agree that timely interac-  \ntion on issues can eliminate the cause for most grievances. While manage-  \nment maintains the right and responsibility to make decisions which affect  \nthe business, the parties will endeavor to jointly evaluate and plan proposed  \nactions that affect the employees, the Union and the Companies.  \nSection 7.02 REQUEST FOR UNION REPRESENTATION  \nThe Companies shall release the appropriate Union representatives who are  \nrequired by the Problem Resolution Procedures.  \nA. At any meeting between a management representative and an  \nemployee in which a formal level of discipline is to be announced, or  \nan investigatory interview where the employee may have a reasonable  \nbasis to expect that disciplinary action may result, a Union represen-  \ntative shall be present, if the employee requests.  \n1.

When is trending toward disciplinary action for job per-  \nformance, for example attendance, quality, quantity, etc., manage-  \nment will normally involve the Union and solicit its input and  \nassistance.

The Union will notify the Company in writing of its intent  \nto escalate the grievance to Step II within thirty (30) cal-  \nendar days following the final disposition of the Step I  \nmeeting or the date it was mutually agreed to omit the  \nStep II meeting.  \nb. The Union\u2019s failure to notify the Company of its intent to  \nescalate the grievance, within the time limits stated in Sec-  \ntion 7.05Ela, will result in the grievance being considered  \nwithdrawn from the Grievance Procedure.  \n2. Holding the Step III Meeting  \na. Management will hold the Step III grievance meeting within  \nthirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the Union\u2019s written  \nintent to escalate the grievance.  \nb.

Following the Step II Meeting  \nManagement will send the Step III Company position to the  \nUnion and the appropriate Labor Relations Director in accor-  \ndance with Section 7.07.  \nPending final settlement of the grievance, the Companies shall not  \nthereafter deal directly with the employee concerning said grievance  \nwithout Union concurrence, but shall deal directly with the Union  \nrepresentative.  \nSection 7.06 SHARING INFORMATION  \nA.  \nDuring the Step I meeting, the Companies and the Union will identify  \nappropriate areas of concern. During Step I and Step II meetings, the  \nCompanies and the Union will share facts deemed relevant to the  \ngrievance by either party.  \nDisputes over relevancy of information and photocopies will be  \nresolved as follows:  \n88  \n1. The request should be presented in writing to the manager. If the  \ndispute is not resolved at this level within seven (7) calendar  \ndays, it shall be referred to:  \n2. The Local Union Officer and District Manager level. If not  \nresolved at this level within seven (7) calendar days, it shall be  \nreferred to:  \n3. The National Union Representative and Labor Relations Direc-  \ntor level. If not resolved at this level within seven (7) calendar  \ndays, the Union may elect to:  \n4. Arbitrate the issue under the provision of Section 7.10.  \nC. The Companies reserve the right to charge the Union for the cost of the  \nphotocopies including the wages of the operator of the copying equip-  \nment in the event the volume of requests become substantial.  \nSection 7.07 COMPANY POSITION  \nThe Step II or Step III Company position (as described in 7.05D3 and  \n7.05E3) shall be sent by certified mail to the National and Local Union in  \nwriting within five (5) calendar days of the final Step II or Step III griev-  \nance meeting.

An employee may present his or her grievance to the employee\u2019s  \nimmediate supervisor within thirty (30) calendar days from the first  \noccurrence, and to other successive levels of management up to and  \nincluding the Department Manager (or authorized representative) as  \nmay be required to resolve the grievance without Union intervention.  \nB. The resolution of an employee grievance may not be inconsistent with  \nthe terms of this Contract. A Union representative will be given an  \nopportunity to be present at the resolution of any employee grievance  \nconcerning the interpretation or application of the terms of this  \nContract.  \n89  \n|  \n  \niw}  \n=  \na  \n=~  \n   \nSection 7.10 ARBITRATION PROCEDURES  \nArbitration cases should be minimal due to effective use of the Problem  \nResolution Procedures. Arbitration should result in timely awards.  \nA.  \nIf the Union is not satisfied with the Companies\u2019 decision at the final  \nmeeting in the grievance procedure, the Union may request that the  \ngrievance be arbitrated.  \nAny Regular or Term employee dismissed for just cause may have his  \nor her case considered under the Arbitration Procedures. However, the  \nquestion as to whether a Regular or Term employee with less than  \ntwelve (12) months\u2019 net credited service was dismissed without just  \ncause will not be eligible for arbitration.  \nThe National Union will notify the Labor Relations Director, in writ-  \ning, of its desire to meet on the grievance within thirty-five (35) cal-  \nendar days of receipt of the Step II or Step III Company position letter  \nas described in Section 7.07 above. The meeting between Labor Rela-  \ntions and the National Union will be held within fifteen (15) calendar  \ndays of receipt of the written notice. The National Union may elect to  \nwaive this meeting and, within the same thirty-five (35) calendar day  \ntime limit, notify the Companies of its intention to arbitrate the griev-  \nance as specified in 7.10D below. If the Union fails to send either writ-  \nten notice within the time limit stated (35 calendar days), and no  \nmutual agreement to extend the time limit has been reached, the  \ngrievance will be considered withdrawn from the grievance process.  \nThe Labor Relations Director, or designated representative, will send  \nthe final Company position letter to the National Union within five (5)  \ncalendar days of the National Union/Labor Relations meeting. Within  \nthirty (30) calendar days following the National Union\u2019s receipt of the  \nCompanies\u2019 final position letter, as described in this Section 7.10D, the  \nUnion will notify the Companies in writing of its intention to arbitrate  \nthe grievance. This notice will specify the issues involved in the griev-  \nance and remedy requested. Specifically it will clarify the Union\u2019s  \noriginal written presentation of the grievance to management. This  \nclarification will define the nature of the grievance; the date of the  \noccurrence; the contractual article/section alleged to have been vio-  \nlated, if applicable, or if not applicable, the source of the alleged  \nviolation (e.g., MOA name or number, discipline, documentation);  \n90  \nthe name of the grievant; and the remedy sought for the purposes of  \narbitration, expedited arbitration and mediation.  \nIf the Union does not notify the Companies in writing of its intention  \nto arbitrate the grievance within the time limit stated (30 calendar  \ndays), and no mutual agreement to extend the time limit has been  \nreached, the grievance will be considered withdrawn from the griev-  \nance process.  \nThe first day of the arbitration hearing will be held within six (6)  \nmonths from the date of the Union\u2019s notification in writing of its intent  \nto arbitrate the grievance. If the arbitration request involves an  \nemployee\u2019s dismissal and the six (6) month time limit is exceeded, the  \nperiod used for computation of any back pay liability for the Company  \nshall not exceed a date six (6) months from the date of the Union\u2019s  \nnotification of intent to arbitrate the dismissal issue, except when the  \ntime limit has been extended by mutual agreement.  \nSection 7.11 ARBITRATOR  \nA.  \nA panel of arbitrators shall be established by the parties for hearing  \nexpedited and regular arbitration cases. Upon receipt of the Union\u2019s  \nintent to arbitrate, each case will be automatically assigned to an avail-  \nable arbitrator. The first case so heard under this procedure shall be  \nassigned to the arbitrator appearing first on the panel. Subsequent  \narbitration requests shall be assigned to other arbitrators in the order  \nof their sequential assignment to the panel. If an arbitrator notifies the  \nparties that he or she is unable to accept a case, it will be referred to  \nthe next arbitrator on the panel.  \nWhenever any arbitrator\u2019s pending arbitration requests exceed three,  \nadditional requests which would otherwise be assigned to him or her  \nin the order of rotation shall be referred to the next arbitrator on the  \npanel.  \nAll eligible grievances shall be handled as follows:  \n1. Request from the arbitrator, at the time of appointment, two or  \nthree proposed alternative hearing dates for hearing days within  \nsix (6) months from the date of the Union\u2019s notification of its  \nintent to arbitrate. If the arbitrator cannot provide a hearing date  \nwithin the six (6) month time frame, the parties shall proceed  \nthrough the remaining arbitrators, in order of appearance, until a  \n91  \n|  \n  \niw}  \n=  \na  \n=~  \n   \nhearing date can be scheduled in accordance with the time lim-  \nits of this Section.  \n2. The designated representatives of the Companies and of the  \nUnion shall promptly agree on a hearing date, secure a firm com-  \nmitment on the hearing date from the arbitrator and schedule the  \nhearing in accordance with regular procedures.  \n3. If the parties can\u2019t agree on a proposed date, then the arbitrator  \nshall schedule a hearing date within the six (6) month time frame.  \nGrievances involving the suspension of an individual employee or a  \ngrievance involving the dismissal of a Regular or Term employee  \nmay be handled in accordance with the Expedited Arbitration provi-  \nsions of Section 7.15 by mutual agreement of the Labor Relations  \nDirector and the designated representative of the National Union,  \nexcept for those which also involve an issue of arbitrability, Contract  \ninterpretation, or work stoppage (strike) activity and those which are  \nalso the subject of an administrative charge or court actions.  \nSection 7.12 POWER OF THE ARBITRATOR  \nA.  \nB.  \nThe Arbitrator has no authority to add to, subtract from, or otherwise  \nmodify the provisions of the Contract.  \nIf the Arbitrator finds that a dismissal was made without just cause, the  \nArbitrator will either:  \n1. Reinstate the employee with back pay computed in accordance  \nwith Section 7.14 as limited by Section 7.10E; or  \n2. Reduce the dismissal to a suspension and reinstate the employee  \nwithout back pay for the period of suspension set by the  \nArbitrator as limited by Section 7.10E.  \nSection 7.13. ARBITRATOR\u2019S DECISION  \nA.  \nExcept as provided in Expedited Arbitration, Section 7.15, the Arbi-  \ntrator will render a decision within thirty (30) calendar days from the  \ndate the matter is submitted.  \nAll decisions within the power of the Arbitrator will be final and  \nbinding on all parties.  \nDecisions rendered under the provisions of Expedited Arbitration,  \nSection 7.15, will not constitute a precedent for other cases or  \n92  \ngrievances and may not be cited or used as a precedent in other arbi-  \ntration matters between the parties.  \nSection 7.14 EFFECT OF RESOLUTION  \nA.  \nWhere employees are reinstated with back pay, the employees will  \nreceive their regular rate of pay for the time lost, but not for suspen-  \nsion time under Section 7.12B2 as limited by Section 7.10E. They will  \nalso receive reimbursement for any actual expenses incurred and paid  \nby the employees during the period of dismissal which would have  \nnormally been paid by the Companies\u2019 Medical, Dental, or Vision  \nPlans. Amounts paid to employees will be reduced by an amount  \nequal to the total of the termination or layoff allowance received from  \nthe Companies at the time of dismissal, and any wages earned in other  \nemployment. Pacific Bell employees will be liable to the State of Cali-  \nfornia, Employment Development Department for overpayment of  \nunemployment benefits received since date of dismissal. Nevada Bell  \nemployees will likewise be liable to the State of Nevada, Employment  \nSecurity Department for such overpayments.  \nIn the event a grievance is arbitrated under the provisions of Expedited  \nArbitration, Section 7.15, any awarded back pay liability shall be  \ncomputed in accordance with the provisions as expressed in Sections  \n7.12B1 and 7.12B2, as limited by Section 7.10E.  \nSection 7.15 EXPEDITED ARBITRATION PROCEDURE  \nThe procedure for Expedited Arbitration will be as follows:  \nA.  \nB.  \nA written stipulation of all facts not in dispute may be submitted to the  \nArbitrator prior to the hearing.  \nThe hearing will be informal without rules of evidence and without a  \ntranscript. However, the Arbitrator will satisfy himself or herself that  \nthe evidence submitted is of a type on which he or she can rely, that  \nthe hearing is fair in all respects and that all facts necessary to a fair  \nsettlement and reasonably obtainable are brought before the Arbitrator.  \nEach party may submit a brief written summary of the issues raised at  \nthe hearing and arguments supporting its position within five (5)  \nworking days after the hearing.  \n93  \n|  \n  \niw}  \n=  \na  \n=~  \n   \nD. The Arbitrator will render his or her decision within five (5) working  \ndays after receiving the briefs. He or she will provide the parties a brief  \nwritten statement of the reasons supporting the decision.  \nSection 7.16 ARBITRATION EXPENSES  \nThe compensation and expenses of the Arbitrator and the general expenses  \nof the arbitration will be borne by the Companies and the Union in equal  \nparts. Each party will bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses.  \nSection 7.17 TIME LIMITS  \nThe time periods specified in the grievance and arbitration procedures will  \nbe calendar days except for Section 7.15 and may be extended by mutual  \nagreement.  \nSection 7.18 MEDIATION  \nA. A grievance that has been appealed to arbitration in accordance with  \nSection 7.10 may be presented at a mediation conference before it is  \nscheduled for arbitration, except when either party requests that medi-  \nation be bypassed.  \nB. Within six (6) months of the Union\u2019s request for arbitration, the par-  \nties will schedule a mediation conference to be held at the earliest  \navailable date of a mediator mutually agreeable to both parties. The  \nmediation conference will normally be held in either a Company or  \nUnion facility. Should the availability of a mediator unnecessarily  \ndelay the processing of the grievance in the opinion of either party,  \neither party may request that the mediation step be bypassed and the  \ngrievance be scheduled for arbitration.  \nC. The spokesperson for the Company will normally be a Staff Man-  \nager\u2014Labor Relations. An Area Representative-Communications  \nWorkers of America will normally represent the Union. An attorney  \nwill not be used by either party at the mediation conference. The num-  \nber of employees who shall suffer no loss in pay under Article 3,  \nSection 3.02 of the Contract shall be no more than two (2). Should  \nadditional employees be necessary for the complete discovery of facts  \nat the conference, the parties will agree in advance on the number of  \nadditional employees who will attend the conference and suffer no loss  \nin pay under Section 3.02.  \n94  \nThe representatives of the parties are encouraged, but not required to  \npresent the mediator with a brief written statement of the facts, the  \nissue and the arguments in support of their respective positions. If such  \nstatement is not presented in written form, it shall be presented orally  \nat the beginning of the mediation conference.  \nThe mediation conference will normally be attended by the grievant,  \nthe Local President, the grievant\u2019s supervisor and District Level  \nManager. Attendance at the mediation conference shall be limited to  \nthose people actually involved in the mediation conference.  \nAll written material that is presented to the mediator or to the other  \nparty shall be returned to the party presenting the material at the ter-  \nmination of the mediation conference. The mediator may, however,  \nretain one copy of the written grievance, to be used solely for purposes  \nof statistical analysis.  \nProceedings before the mediator shall be informal in nature. The pres-  \nentation of evidence is not limited to that which has been presented in  \nthe grievance proceedings. However, the issue mediated will be the  \nsame as the issue the parties have tried to resolve through the griev-  \nance process. The rules of evidence will not apply, and no record of the  \nmediation conference shall be made.  \nThe mediator will have the authority to meet separately with Company  \nor Union representatives, but will not have the authority to compel the  \nresolution of a grievance.  \nThe Company and Union spokespersons at the mediation conference  \nmay accept the resolution proposed by the mediator and such settle-  \nment or any other settlement resulting from the conference shall not  \nbe precedent-setting for other cases or grievances and may not be  \ncited in any other proceeding between the parties. If no settlement is  \nreached during the mediation conference, the mediator shall provide  \nthe parties with an immediate oral advisory opinion, unless both  \nparties agree that no opinion shall be provided. The mediator shall  \nstate the grounds of his or her advisory opinion.  \nIf no settlement is reached at the mediation conference, the grievance  \nwill be heard in arbitration in accordance with provisions expressed in  \nSection 7.10. Such hearing will be held within six (6) months of the  \ndate of the mediation hearing. In the event that a grievance which has  \nbeen mediated subsequently is arbitrated, no person serving as a  \n95  \n|  \n  \niw}  \n=  \na  \n=~  \n   \nmediator between these parties may serve as arbitrator. Nothing said  \nor done by the mediator may be referred to at arbitration. Any settle-  \nment proposal made by either party at the mediation conference shall  \nnot be referred to at the arbitration hearing.  \nThe mediator shall conduct no more than three (3) mediation confer-  \nences per day. The fee and reasonable expenses of the mediator will  \nbe shared equally by the parties.  \nIn the event that the mediation of a grievance is scheduled, and then  \npostponed or canceled, the parties shall remain liable for the fee spec-  \nified in Section 7.18K, unless another grievance is substituted for that  \ngrievance postponed or canceled.  \nSection 7.19 DISMISSALS  \nA.  \nThe Companies agree that no employee will be dismissed without a  \nfull and complete investigation by department supervision. The Com-  \npanies recognize the right of the Union to assist an employee who has  \nbeen suspended pending investigation, or who has been given notice  \nof dismissal, or who has been dismissed, in presenting and/or  \nappealing the employee\u2019s case to the Companies.  \nWhen it is necessary to dismiss an employee, the employee must be  \npaid in full immediately for all time due. Every employee who is  \ndismissed will be paid at the place of dismissal.  \n96  \n"], ["ARTICLE 8  \nLAYOFFS  \n", "Section 8.01 LAYOFFS (For Pacific Bell Home  \nEntertainment, see Appendix B,  \nSection B2.01)  \nA. The National Union will be notified in writing in the event that any of  \nthe Companies deems it necessary to lay off Regular employees due  \nto a change that will materially alter that Company\u2019s Business Plan  \nachievement, as described in Article 2, Employment Security, Section  \n2.01.  \nB.

For Regular part-time employees, the amount of layoff allowance  \nis determined by reducing the employee\u2019s basic weekly wage  \nrate in proportion to the average number of hours worked to the  \naverage number of full-time hours applicable to the tours within  \nwhich the hours were worked during the twenty-six (26) weeks  \nimmediately preceding the layoff.  \n2. Any vacation payment to which the employee is eligible will be  \nmade in addition to the layoff allowance.  \nD. If anemployee who has received a layoff allowance is recalled or reen-  \ngaged, and the number of weeks since the effective date of leaving is  \nless than the number of weeks\u2019 pay upon which the layoff allowance  \nwas based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount  \npaid to the employee for the excess number of weeks will be consid-  \nered as an advance to the employee by the Companies. Repayment of  \nthis amount will be made at the time of reemployment, or through pay-  \nroll deductions in each payroll period at the rate of at least ten (10) per-  \ncent per week of the employee\u2019s basic weekly wage rate, with the  \nentire amount to be repaid within twelve (12) months of the date  \nreemployed.  \nE. who has been laid off and given a layoff allowance is  \nsubsequently recalled or reengaged and again laid off, the layoff  \nallowance in the case of the second layoff or of any subsequent layoff  \nwill be based on the employee\u2019s net credited service, less any prior  \nlayoff allowance received and not refunded to the Companies. How-  \never, no deduction will be made from the second or subsequent layoff  \nallowance if the employee has been back at work for at least twenty-  \nfour (24) months since the date of reemployment.  \nF. Employees specifically designated as surplus and laid off will retain  \ncertain recall rights for twenty-four (24) months following the date  \nthey left the work group. Recall rights will be administered as follows:  \n1. Surplus employees who are laid off must submit a form pro-  \nvided by the Companies if they wish to be recalled from layoff.  \nOn this form, employees may express their preferences for reas-  \nsignment or placement after recall. They may designate any job  \n98  \ntitles for which they are qualified as the job titles in which they  \nwish to be placed should vacancies occur. Employees may also  \ndesignate as many work locations as they wish for placement  \nconsideration. These location designations may be as specific  \n(e.g., a building) or as general (e.g., a city or an entire geograph-  \nical area) as the employees desire. The employees\u2019 preferences  \nmay be modified by the submission of a revised form as often as  \nthey wish during the twenty-four (24) month period that the  \nemployees retain their individual recall rights. Employees laid off  \nunder the terms of this Section must keep the Companies  \ninformed of the address where they can be reached.  \nLaid off employees will receive placement priority as described  \nin Section 2.04B 1b.  \nA given employee shall receive only one (1) job offer for a posi-  \ntion in the employee\u2019s previous work group. The employee will  \nreceive only one (1) job offer for a position in the same job title  \nin one (1) work location within a headquarters which the  \nemployee requested. The employee will receive a maximum of  \ntwo (2) job offers in any other job titles for which the employee  \nis qualified. If an employee refuses to accept the one (1) job offer  \nmade in either of the first two (2) cases described above or refuses  \nto accept two (2) offers made in the last case, the employee will  \nreceive no other job offers.  \nIF THE EMPLOYEE IS OFFERED THEN  \n1. A job in his/her previous work group no other job offers will be made.  \n2. A job in the same title in one (1)  \nwork location which he/she requested no other job offers will be made.  \n3.

If the  \nemployee accepts a job offer, the employee has fifteen (15) cal-  \nendar days from the date of acceptance to report to work.
