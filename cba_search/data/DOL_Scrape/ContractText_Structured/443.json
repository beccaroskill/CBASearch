Such transmittal will not be  \nperformed by a non-NABET-CWA ABC employee.  \n(tii) Normally, news material gathered hereunder will be  \nedited for use by the Company pursuant to the applicable  \nprovisions of the Master Agreement. In situations where  \nthe time required to comply with said provisions  \nmight reasonably be expected to delay the broadcasting  \n$4  \n   \nSection A2.2(e)3Gii) Cont\u2019  \nof such materia] to the public, then such material may be edited at any  \navailable facility. Such editing will not be performed by a non-  \nNABET-CWA ABC employee.  \n(i)  \nMd  \neH  \nti  \n{ii}  \n(iii)  \nWhen the Company intends to cover a news story with  \nelectronic cameras capable of being hand-held, it may pool  \nwhatever lighting work is necessary for such coverage with  \nany news and other information gathering compan(ies) or  \norganization(s), The companies will rotate such pool lighting  \nassignments on a basis that will] assure that ABC\u2019s  \nengineering employees will handle a fair proportion of the  \nwork involved in such assignments. When ABC is to supply  \nthe lighting under such arrangement, NABET-CWA-  \nrepresented engineering employees will be assigned to  \nperform such work.  \nSimilarly, when two (2) or three (3) of the four (4) companies  \nintend to cover a news story and the third (3rd) or fourth  \n(4th) such company 1s either not covering that news story at  \nall, or is covering it with a film crew, the other two (2) or  \nthree (3) companies may pool whatever lighting work is  \nnecessary for such coverage. The companies participating in  \nsuch pool lighting assignments wilt rotate the assignments on  \na basis that will assure that ABC engineering employees will  \nhandle a fair proportion of the work involved in such  \nassignments. When ABC is to supply the lighting under such  \narrangement, NABET-C WA-represented engineering  \nemployees will be assigned to perform such work.  \nThe engineering employees of the company performing the  \npooled lighting assignment hereunder shall, upon request,  \nperform for any of the other companies such additional or  \nmodified lighting work (including relocating and refocusing  \nof lights) as may be required by them for their special use  \n(e.g., a \u201cstandupper\u201d that takes place before, during or after  \nthe companies\u2019 general coverage of the story itself) but may  \nperform such additional or modified lighting for such other  \ncompanies only if such additional or modified lighting takes  \nplace in the same general area as the pooled lighting itself.  \nWhere the pooled lighting itself ts in a room, the term  \n\u201cgeneral area\u201d shall include the same room or an immediately  \nadjacent area.  \n85  \n(iv)  \n(v)  \n(vi)  \n{vii}  \nIn situations when it is ABC's turn to provide pool lighting, if  \nthe Company should assign an engineer(s) specifically to the  \nremote location in advance of the arrival of its crew in order  \n10 be responsible for the necessary pool lighting work, the  \nclassification of one (1) such engineer shall be a Group 7.  \nExcept as provided for in the preceding sentence, the parties  \nrecognize that lighting for the poo) can be assigned to the  \nengineering employees assigned to the crew in accordance  \nwith this Section A2.2(e).  \nIn addition to the foregoing, if two (2) or more of the  \ncompanies are covering a Presidential trip with equipment of  \nthe type covered by this Section A2.2(\u00a2), within the  \nContinental United States (but outside Washington, D.C., or  \nits immediate vicinity), sach companies may similarly pool  \nwhatever lighting work is necessary. The companies will  \nrotate these Presidential trip assignments where lighting is  \npooled on a basis that will assure that ABC's engineering  \nemployees will handle a fair proportion of such overall  \nPresidential trips. The company which has the pool  \nresponsibility under the terms of this Subparagraph will  \nassign an additional engineering employee to the crew(s) to  \nperform whatever pool or unilateral lighting work may be  \nrequired by the pool participants as well as other work that  \nmay be required to assist the other crew members, such as  \nmoving or transporting equipment. It is understood that on  \nPresidential trips, some lighting functions may be performed  \nby non-Company personnel in connection with \u201clighting the  \nPresident\u2019, as heretofore.  \nThe foregoing Subparagraphs are only applicable to pickups  \nof the type described in Subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (v) where  \ncamera coverage is handled on a unilateral basis by each  \ncompany and it is therefore understood that technica] work  \nunretated to lighting will not be affected by this Agreement.  \nA record will be kept by the Company of pool assignments  \nmade hereunder and will show which companies\u2019 employees  \nwere assigned to do the lighting work. The purpose is to  \nassure an equitable distribution of the work performed  \nhereunder. Such record shall be available to the Union.  \n86  \n(viit)  \n(ix)  \n(x}  \nA>  \n   \nSection A2.2\u00a2\u00a2)4 (vill)  \nThis Paragraph 4 is limited to the situations described above.  \nIt is not intended to imply either the same or a different  \ntreatment in other situations. [t wil] not be precedent for any  \nassignments of work on any pickups except those specified  \nherein, and neither this Paragraph 4 nor any practice under it  \non any pickup covered by it, nor any practice preceding this  \nParagraph 4 if it had been in effect on that date, will be cited  \nin any case covering a different type of pickup. Specifically,  \nnot fo be cited in any such case, is the use of the lighting  \n\u201cpool\u201d arrangement hereunder for pooling only part of the  \ntechnical work involved in a particular pickup.  \nIt is the intent of the foregoing provisions of this Section  \nA2.2(e)4 that when two (2) or more of the four (4) companies  \nare covering a news pickup with equipment of the type  \ndescribed herein, the lighting wil] be performed by the  \nengineering employees of one (1} of such companies.  \nHowever, it is recognized that situations may develop when  \norganizations other than ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are  \nalready present at the site of the pickup which may make it  \nimpracticable for any of the companies to set up lights  \nalthough their gear and engineering personnel are available at  \nthe site. If such situations are not kept to a minimum, ABC  \nand NABET-CWA will consult with each other in order to  \ndevelop procedures, together with other companies and  \nunions, if possible, to solve such problems  \nOn news pickups in the ficld, not covered by (i) through (ix)  \nabove, engineering employees assigned to the event in  \naccordance with this Section A2.2(e) shall perform any  \nlighting functions that are performed unless the lighting is to  \nbe performed in a location where another union has  \ncontracted \u201chouse jurisdictian\u201d over lighting functions which  \ndoes noi exclude electranic news pickups, Further, when  \nlights have already been set up by other film or tape crews at  \na place where the news story is to be cavered, the pickup may  \nbe made without employees hereunder setting up lights if  \nsuch other lights are sufficient for the pickup. {lt is the intent  \nof the Company that the engineering crew and their gear will  \nnormally be assigned to the site in such a manner that they  \nwill have time and equipment to do the lighting just as  \nthough no one else had done it.)  \n(See Sideletters AZ and BA.)  \n87  \n(i)  \n(11)  \n   \nNothing in the Master Agreement shall preclude the  \nCompany from:  \n(a) utilizing stations to do pickups that are made outside a  \nradius of two hundred (200) miles of each owned  \ntelevision office of the Company as set forth in Section  \n11.4 of the Master Agreement, provided the station is  \nwithin two hundred (200) miles of the pickup; and  \n(b} utilizing affiliates to do pickups that are made  \noutside a seventy-five (75) mile radius of each  \nowned television office of the Company as set forth  \nin Section 11.4 of the Master Agreement, but if  \nsuch pickup is made within a pwo hundred (200)  \nmile radius of such office, the affiliate must be  \nwithin thirty-five (35) miles of the pickup; and  \n(c) using talent to perform a live of  \nmaterial and a live \u201cvoice over\u201d of materia] from  \nthe facility transmitting the material if the material  \noriginates outside a seventy-five (75) mile radius of  \nany television office of the Campany and is being  \ntransmitted under Paragraph 3(1i) of Section  \nA2.2(e}; and  \n(d) accepting videotaped news material, cither within  \nor without any of the radi above mentioned, from a  \n\u201cstringer\u201d, i.e., a person not covered by this  \nAgreement who sells news material to the  \nCompany but who is not an employee of ABC and  \nhas not been assigned nor hired by the Company to  \ncover the news story.  \nAn ENG assignment is one in which employees are assigned  \nto the gathering of news in the field using electronic cameras  \ncapable of being hand-held and associated equipment and the  \ntechnical editing of such news in the field. -  \nThe following provisions shall apply to staff employees engaged at  \nCompany News Bureaus (other than the Washington News Bureau}  \nwithin the Continental United States (except Alaska), for engineering  \nfunctions associated with news material obtained by electronic cameras  \ncapable of being hand-held and associated equipment:  \n88  \n(i)  \n(il)  \n(iii)  \nqu  \nSection (i  \nSuch staff employees shal] be covered under the Master  \nAgreement to the extent set forth below, and shall constitute a  \nseparate seniority group at cach such Bureau, subject to the  \nprovisions of Paragraph (v} below, except that those Bureaus  \nwithin two hundred (200) miles of a television office covered  \nby this Agreement shall be a part of the nearest television  \noffice for Unit Seniority purposes. For purposes such as per  \ndiem, hotel and travel expenses, either the Bureau or the  \nemployee\u2019s home, whichever is the more appropriate, shall  \nconstitute the employee's home office. In additton to such  \nstaff persons, such Bureaus may employ persons on a daily  \nbasis to work in and/or outside such Bureaus, subjeci to the  \ndaily employment provisions in Article A-X1V.  \nThose staff employees who are primarily assigned to news  \npickups in the field shall be employed and or upgraded in  \naccordance with the provisions of Section A2.2(e)2.
