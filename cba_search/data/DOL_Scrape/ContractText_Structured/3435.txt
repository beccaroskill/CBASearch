of NJAC 6:11-3 with regard to mandated professional  
development for teachers.

js assigned or to other training programs designed  
specifically for instructional assistants.

the employment areas of secretary, security, and  
school/community program coordinators will be provided  
by the District on workdays during the in-school work  
year for staff members in said employment categories.

and the Association.  
22:3-6 The parties agree that all Sections of Article  
22:3 above shall become effective September 1, 1999.  
22:3-7 The parties agree that any modifications of  
State regulations regarding mandated continuing
