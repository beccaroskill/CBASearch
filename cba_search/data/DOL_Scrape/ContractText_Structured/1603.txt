Agreement, except clean-up and maintenance of home, yard, shop and warehouses, and except  
when yard, shop or warehouse work is performed under the terms of other agreements with the

D. Observance of Agreement in Subcontracts:  
(1) Each subcontract for construction, covered under the terms of this Agreement, granted by a

where the covered work is only incidental to the subcontract. Incidental is defined as very

benefits owed by the subcontractor to any worker covered under this Agreement for work  
performed on the contractor's job, provided that written demand is sent to the  
subcontractor, with a copy to the contractor, and payment has not been made within five  
(5) working days after receipt of such demand by the subcontractor. Moreover, the union  
Contract Administrator of the employee benefits fund will be responsible for notifying  
active signatory general contractors and members of delinquencies by the 25th of each  
month (postmark shall be the determining date). If the union does not notify the affected  
general contractor of the delinquency of a subcontractor by the 25th of the month  
following the end of the month in which the time was worked, the general contractor will  
not be responsible for the payment of wages and fringe benefits of the subcontractor.  
Further, the union shall withhold employees from the delinquent subcontractor and take  
whatever action it deems prudent in order to enforce compliance, provided, however, the  
union has notified the affected contractor(s) within (5) days prior to the commencement of  
such action as per Article IX of this Agreement. Action taken under this provision shall not  
be deemed a violation of the no-strike provisions of Article X during the period of any  
such delinquency.  
As used in this Agreement, subcontracting is the performance on the job site of covered  
construction by any person, firm, or corporation pursuant to an agreement with a contractor  
or subcontractor. A subcontractor is one who performs subcontracting and includes the  
subcontractor of a subcontractor.  
This clause applies to laborers working in support of primary crafts to which the  
contractor is signatory.  
The general contractor will seek bids from union subcontractors. If union subcontract bids  
that are received are not competitive and a non-union subcontractor is used, the general  
contractor will so notify the union within 48 hours of bid time, Saturdays, Sundays, and  
holidays excluded.  
At the option of the union, the general contractor will arrange a meeting of a representative  
of the union, the subcontractor, and a representative of the genera! contractor, to discuss  
the possibility and merits of a labor agreement prior to the subcontractor, and a  
representative of the general contractor, to discuss the possibility and merits of a labor  
agreement prior to the subcontractor starting work on the project. If an agreement is not  
reached between the subcontractor and the Union and if the general contractor uses the  
non-union subcontractor, this Article I.1.D does not apply.  
Union Recognition. The Union signatory hereto is the exclusive bargaining representative for all  
employees performing construction work within the craft jurisdiction of the Laborers. The  
CONTRACTORS recognize the Union as the sole exclusive collective bargaining representative for the  
workmen employed to perform, and performing construction work in New Mexico. The jurisdiction of  
the UNION shall be that which has been historically defined by the Building and Construction Trades  
Department of the American Federation of Labor Congress of Industrial Organizations and as it may be  
further defined through jurisdictional agreements, decisions and awards.  
Association Recognition. The UNION recognizes the ASSOCIATION as the sole and exclusive  
collective bargaining representative for those of its members whom it is authorized to represent in

workers; and any other classes of employees which may be excluded from coverage under the National

CONTRACTORS. However, if any UNION enters into an agreement with any employer covering  
construction in any part of New Mexico, which agreement provides for lower wage rates or working  
conditions or terms of any kind which are more favorable to the employer than this Agreement, (all  
hereinafter referred to as "more favorable terms") then such more favorable terms shall forthwith become  
part of this Agreement and shall supersede the wage rates, working conditions and provisions hereof,

geographic jurisdiction of the UNION.

female, and Vietnam-era Veteran job applicants by contacting recognized representatives of  
those groups in their state and by taking such other steps as are necessary to comply with  
such statutes. If any Union is unable, within a reasonable time, to provide a Contractor with  
applicants who satisfy the criteria or requirements contained in any regulation of, or program  
or agreement entered into by such Contractor or Union with the Equal Employment

Contractor can make determinations as to "reasonable accommodations.” Further, the Union  
Shall! not refuse to make referrals because it believes that "reasonable accommodations” are  
not possible. The Contractor shall have sole discretion to hire workers outside the  
hiring/referral hail in the event it determines that the Union's conduct is not consistent with

time to inspect the referral hall facilities, examine any and all records pertaining to its  
operation or otherwise provided for herein, and make any investigation necessary to establish  
that the terms of this Article are being fully complied with. Any information contained in the  
records provided for under Sections 4, 8, and 9 shall be made available to any Contractor or  
the Association, by telephone or by mail, as it may request.  
   
10. Posting. A full copy of this Article shall be posted in plain view and made available for  
inspection by applicants for employment and employees, at the referral hall at or near the  
place of registration, at each building site, at each Contractor's permanent office and at any  
other place where notices to employees and applicants are customarily posted. The notice  
shall carry in bold type the following:  
"NOTICE TO ALL APPLICANTS, WHETHER OR NOT MEMBERS OF A UNION: An  
Agreement exists between the NEW MEXICO BUILDING BRANCH, AGC, and the NEW  
MEXICO AND WESTERN TEXAS LABORER'S DISTRICT COUNCIL and its affiliated LIUNA  
LOCAL NO. 16 providing for a nondiscriminatory system for recruiting applicants for  
employment."  
11. Areas Excluded. This Article shall have no application to construction work to be performed or  
put in place in an area so remote that the Union cannot provide registration and referral  
service through a referral hall for the site or project, of which fact the Union shall promptly  
notify the Contractor, or when, due to some governmental rule or regulation, the registration  
or referral provisions herein cannot be lawfully applied to a site or project.  
9

them to an employer, documentation which establishes citizenship or other legal status to  
work in the United States. These documents shall be any of the documents that are allowed  
under the regulations promulgated under IRCA. Copies of this documentation shall  
accompany the referral to the employer. This section may be amended mutually when  
regulations are finalized on these requirements.  
15. Save Harmless. Should either the Contractor or Union violate, or fail to comply with, any of the  
terms or conditions of this Article, by discrimination or otherwise, and thereby cause liability  
to be asserted against or imposed on the other, the non-complying party shall indemnify,  
defend, save and hold the other harmless from any and all liability, loss, cost, expense, and  
damage, including, but not limited to, legal fees, wages or other charges incurred by reason

in writing.

from the service or released from hospitalization, if such discharge or release occurred

established under the Universal Military Training and Service Act.  
(8) Any registrant who is passed over by virtue of not being present in the referral hall

registrant refuses to accept employment, after accepting referral, or quits, his name shall be  
placed at the bottom of the group list for which he qualifies.
