The employee returning to the bargaining unit  \ncan only be placed in the first available job open for hire (no other employee has job preference or recall  \nrights to this position). The returned employee will be eligible for all benefits effective immediately  \nupon returning to the bargaining unit based on the adjusted seniority date at that time. The adjusted  \nseniority date will be the employee's total continuous service with the company less the time the  \nemployee was in a salaried position. The returned employee will accumulate seniority as a new  \nemployee for the first six (6) months after returning to the bargaining unit, and this seniority will be used  \nwhen the company administers the layoff/recall procedure, shift transfers and assigns overtime. The  \nreturned employee will not be eligible to transfer under the provisions of the job preference procedure  \nuntil after six (6) months from the date of returning to the bargaining unit. At the end of six (6) months,  \nthe returned employee's seniority date will be adjusted and will be used when the company administers  \nall provisions of the agreement including job preference, shift transfers, layoff/recall procedure and the  \nassignment of overtime. This adjusted seniority date will be the employee's total continuous service less  \nthe time the employee was transferred out of the bargaining unit.  \nSection 4.10 Current Information.  \nEmployees are required to notify Human Resources, in writing, of their present post office address and  \ntelephone number and of any change(s) thereafter.

Shift Premium.  \nA shift premium of fifty cents ($0.50) per hour will be paid to employees working the second shift. A  \nshift premium of sixty cents ($0.60) per hour will be paid to employees working the third shift.  \nSection 6.5 Assignment of Overtime.  \nA. The company will make every reasonable effort to distribute overtime among qualified employees  \nwithin their classification, area, and shift. Employees who are requested to work overtime will be given  \nas much advance notice as possible, it being the intent that in the absence of an emergency, the employee  \nwill be notified of daily overtime, prior to the lunch period and of weekend overtime by the previous  \nThursday as set forth in the following paragraphs.  \nAn employee performing an out-of-classification assignment, for fifteen (15) days or less is ineligible  \nfor overtime until employees in said classifications are allowed to work first. The out-of-classification  \nemployee, however, is entitled to overtime in his/her normal classification. Should an out-of-  \nclassification assignment last more than fifteen (15) days, the employee will be considered in-  \nclassification for purposes of overtime scheduling.  \nIn the event an error exists with any overtime schedule after being posted, associates are obligated to  \nbring it to supervision\u2019s attention one (1) hour prior to the close of their workday, so that immediate  \ncorrection can be made. An employee shall only be compensated for missed overtime opportunity if  \nmanagement fails to correct the schedule after receiving proper notification.  \n10  \nB. 1. Sign-up sheets for voluntary daily overtime will be posted each day for associates to indicate  \ntheir availability within two (2) hours from the start of their regular shift. Overtime schedules will  \nbe posted daily prior to lunch period. Available overtime will be distributed between volunteers  \nwithin the classification and area, then classification, provided they have the necessary skills and  \nabilities to perform the work assignment and are willing to work the hour\u2019s necessary, beginning  \nwith the highest seniority employee. The company reserves the right to request or schedule the  \nemployees in the classification who have not signed the volunteer list, prior to scheduling out of  \nclassification employees.  \nOn a daily basis, once overtime is assigned to employee(s) within the classification as set forth  \nabove, further available overtime may be assigned to senior employee(s) from other classifications  \nprovided they have the necessary skills and abilities.  \nDaily voluntary overtime may be cancelled by associates up to one-half (1/2 hour prior to lunch, as  \nwell as supervision\u2019s notice to employees of cancellation two (2) hours prior to the overtime  \ncommencement. If the Company fails to cancel overtime prior to two (2) hours of commencement,  \nthe employee may decide to work or not. If the employee fails to provide proper cancellation notice,  \nthe absence will be charged against the attendance policy and perfect attendance bonus plan.  \n2. However employee(s) may be required to work up to six (6) hours of daily overtime per week,  \nwhich overtime shall not be more than two (2) hours per day Monday through Friday, and shall be  \ninclusive of voluntary and forced overtime. An employee who desires to refuse daily overtime in  \nexcess of six (6) hours in any week must so notify his supervisor on Monday of the week in question  \nor, if he is given notice the overtime is being scheduled later in the week, at the time he is given  \nsuch notice.  \n   \nC. The Company may request overtime work for the sixth and seventh workday (weekend) of a normal  \nworkweek in the following manner:  \n1. First the company will select volunteers as follows:  \n(a) The Company shall post a notice setting forth the classifications, areas and shifts to be  \nworked on the weekend.  \n(b) During a normal workweek the sign-up sheet shall be posted on Monday of the week  \nand shall be taken down for scheduling purposes no sooner than 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday.  \n(c) Employees selected for Saturday overtime will be notified by scheduled lunch period  \non the fourth workday of the regular week (Thursday) and for Sunday, by the scheduled  \nlunch period on the fifth workday (Friday). If an employee volunteers to work overtime  \nand is chosen, the employee must work. Such posting constitutes notification of the  \nemployee(s).  \n(d) Qualified volunteers will be selected first by seniority within the classification, area,  \nand shift. If a need still exists, senior qualified volunteer(s) in the classification (on the  \nshift) will be chosen. Then, the senior qualified volunteer(s) on the shift out of  \nclassification will be chosen. Next, the senior qualified volunteer(s) in the classification  \n(all shifts) will be chosen; and then if a need still exists, the senior qualified volunteer(s)  \nout of the classification (all shifts) will be chosen.  \n(e) When only one (1) shift is scheduled on a weekend day, senior employees will be  \nchosen, regardless of shift, through the steps listed above. If only two shifts are working,  \nthird shift shall be included by seniority.  \n2. On the sixth (or seventh, per Appendix G) work day, should the company fail to get a sufficient  \nnumber of employees (volunteers) for weekend overtime work, then the Company may assign  \nrequired overtime to junior employees on the shift within their area and then within their  \n11  \nclassification and in the case of Multiple Process Operators by junior qualified employees. The  \nCompany shall designate one weekend per month where mandatory overtime is not required.  \n3. No employee will work more than one (1) shift on a weekend day until all qualified volunteers  \nhave been scheduled a shift on each weekend day respectively.  \n4, Employees not notified of their overtime selection or assignment within the time as set forth in  \nsubparagraph (c) above, will not be required to work weekend overtime, unless the employee  \nvolunteered to work after the scheduled lunch period on the fourth day.  \n5. If an employee's voluntary or involuntary request for weekend overtime is accepted by the  \nCompany and the employee fails to work all or any portion of such overtime, that employee's failure  \nto work shall be counted as an absence and charged against the Attendance Program and Perfect  \nAttendance Bonus Plan.  \n6. Employees working weekend overtime shall be paid the rate of pay for the work performed, or  \ntheir normal regular hourly rate, whichever is greater.  \n7. Employees who are on a scheduled full day vacation, during the normal workweek on Monday  \nor Friday will not be required to work the adjoining weekend overtime, provided that the vacation  \nis scheduled before lunchtime on Thursday. However, employees who subsequently cancel vacation  \nscheduled for Monday or Friday, after having been excused from weekend overtime, will be  \n\"pointed\" for missing that overtime under the Attendance Program. Such points will impact the  \nPerfect Attendance bonus plan.  \nSection 6.6 Reporting Pay.  \nAn employee who reports for scheduled or prearranged work and who has not been notified to refrain  \nfrom reporting for work shall be guaranteed, either four (4) hours work at his basic hourly rate plus  \napplicable shift premium, or pay equal to four (4) times his hourly rate plus applicable shift premium,  \nless time deducted for tardiness, if any. Employees shall not be paid report-in pay if they refuse assigned  \nwork.  \nThe following shall be deemed appropriate notice when work shall not be available for reasons other  \nthan hazardous road conditions or the conditions outlined in the last sentence of Section 6.6: 1)  \nNotification to the employee or a responsible member of his family given at least two (2) hours prior to  \nhis scheduled starting time, or 2) notice posted by the Company the day before on the Company bulletin  \nboard and notice given to the Shop Committee. This Section 6.6 shall not apply if work is not available  \nbecause of an emergency such as work stoppage by employees, power failure, fire, explosion, or acts of  \nGod.  \nSection 6.7 Hazardous Road C onditions.  \nIf the Company, due to hazardous road conditions, decides to close the plant, a notice of one and a half  \n(1-1/2) hours prior to the start of the scheduled shift will be announced on the company call in line.  \nProvided the Company has the technological capabilities, the Company shall also implement group texts  \nfor notification. However, implementation of the group text notification system will not otherwise relieve  \nemployees from the duty to check the call in line for plant closure updates. If the Company decides to  \nclose the plant due to hazardous road conditions before the end of the scheduled shift, those employees  \nthat leave work will be considered excused under the Program and will not impact the No  \nAbsent Day Bonus Plan. However, this will not be construed to relinquish an employee's right for  \nReporting Pay if the plant is closed after the start of his normal shift. Notwithstanding notification by  \nthe Company, if a snow emergency is declared by the county in which the associate is a resident, that  \nassociate shall be excused from work for the affected shifts. In that case, the associate shall be required  \nto call in.  \n12  \n"], ["ARTICLE VII  \nHolidays  \n", "Section 7.1 Recognized Holidays.  \nThe following holidays are recognized: New Y ear's Day, Thanksgiving Day, Good Friday, Day after  \nThanksgiving Day, Memorial Day, Day before Christmas Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day,  \nLabor Day, and Day before New Y ear's Day.  \nThe holidays identified above falling on Saturday will be observed on the preceding Friday and those  \nfalling on Sunday will be observed on the following Monday, except where said holiday is celebrated  \non a different day as a result of a national proclamation.
