hour scheduled work days. The present work week is seven  
(7) consecutive days ending Sunday midnight except in those  
cases where the W-day and ST-days span midnight.  
B. WORK DAY (W-Day): A work day is normally the  
twenty-four (24)-hour period from midnight to midnight of  
the day on which an employee is scheduled to work. When  
a normal work day spans midnight, time shall be charged

spans midnight, the employee’s ST-day will be a twenty-  
four (24)-hour period commencing at the end of his normally  
scheduled hours.  
D. NORMAL WORK SCHEDULES: Normal work schec-  
ules will specify for each employee the work week, the W-  
days, the ST-days and working hours of each W-day.

Section 2. Working Hours  
A. The parties hereto recognize that the business of the  
Company requires continuous operation for twenty-four (24)  
hours of every day. In such operation it is inherent that work-  
ing schedules must be established by the Company and  
may from time to time be changed to meet changing condi-  
tions.  
B. Normal work schedules will be established by the Com-  
pany and posted for each employee or group of employees.  
Section 3. Temporary Changes in Working Hours and  
Work Schedules  
A. Temporary changes in work schedules or working  
hours will be made:  
(1) When an employee is substituting for another em-  
ployee who is off duty. When notification of such  
substitution occurs after the beginning of a work  
week in which the substitution is to occur, only the  
working hours of the substituting employee’s W-  
days will be changed for that work week. If the  
substitution extends beyond the end of the work  
week, or if the substitution starts at the beginning  
of a work week, the schedule of the substituting  
employee will be the normal work schedule of the  
relieved employee.  
When it is necessary to carry out work which must  
be done outside normal working hours, such as  
work on equipment which cannot be made avail-  
able during normal working hours, and work in two

cept where otherwise provided in this Section,  
when such changes are made, (a) only the work-  
ing hours of the W-days may be changed; (b) the  
ST-days will not be changed; (c) temporary sched-  
ules will be prepared and posted at the Headquar-

and (b) of this Paragraph A (2) shall not be appili-  
cable to employees involved in equipment outages  
that have a direct effect on the operating capacity  
of power generating stations.  
(3) When an employee is scheduled to attend a for-  
mal training school or other Company training pro-  
grams. In-these cases, both the W-days and ST-  
days will be changed to conform with the training  
schedules. If the employee is notified forty-eight

ule may be returned to his normal work schedule at any  
time. Lunch periods established for such schedules shall  
not exceed one hour.

schedule providing a substitution for an employee  
off duty, which had not been scheduled for the sub-  
-Stituting employee prior to quitting time on the last  
W-day of the work week preceding the substitu-  
tion. This applies only to the first such change in  
any work week. For the purpose of this Paragraph,  
such changed shift schedule is one which involves  
a change from one shift to another—day shift to  
middle or night shift, etc., and does not include  
either a change involving only different hours in  
the same shift or a return from a temporary shift  
schedule to a regular shift schedule.

ally worked, which would have been scheduled  
for the employee if it were a W-day or which were  
scheduled for the employee for whom he is  
substituting, will be paid for at:  
(a) Double and one-half time, when it is the  
second ST-day in a work week.

Section 5. Rest Periods  
A Rest periods shall be applicable in accordance with  
the following provisions when employees are called out or

non-scheduled hours provided employees are eligible as  
defined in the “Rest Period Rules” of Exhibit B of this Agree-  
ment.  
B. Employees working for a period that consists of at least  
three (3) overtime hours, and up to sixteen (16) consecutive  
overtime hours, shall be entitled, when relieved from duty,  
to a rest period as shown on the table in Exhibit B. If sched-  
uled hours fall within the time designated as a rest period,  
the employee will be paid straight time pay for these sched-  
uled hours. Employees required to work during scheduled  
hours that fall within the prescribed rest period, will receive  
pay at time and one-half the employee’s straight time rate  
for such hours worked.  
C. Employees working sixteen (16) or more consecutive  
hours shail be entitled, when relieved from duty, to an eight  
(8)-hour rest period or a rest period as shown on the rest  
period table, whichever is greater, without loss of straight  
time pay for scheduled hours falling within the rest period.  
However, employees required to work during this period will  
be paid two times the straight time rate for any hours worked  
within eight (8) hours after being released from the previous  
work period and their rest period will be calculated using  
the twelve (12)-hour cumulative rule as provided for in Ex-  
hibit B.  
D. The intent of rest periods is for employees to be re-  
leased from work when they have worked sufficient over-  
time hours to become eligible for a rest period. If an em-  
ployee requests to be released on rest period, their request  
shail be granted unless there is an emergency or the com-  
pany is unable to obtain relief, when necessary.

A. Both parties recognize that certain employees cov-  
ered by this Agreement are in jobs which are exempt from  
the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and that em-  
ployees may be hired or transferred to new jobs which will  
likewise be exempt. In order to meet the requirements of  
the Act, the Company will continue to classify all employees  
as exempt or non-exempt.  
B. Some of the jobs may be of such nature that the work  
cannot be scheduled to conform to a definite schedule (such  
as a forty (40)-hour week or five (5) eight (8)-hour days) and  
that, therefore, the overtime provisions of this Agreement  
may not be applicable to these jobs.  
C. It is agreed that for any new jobs in which there are  
employees eligible for Union membership, the Union and  
Company will jointly determine whether the work is of this  
nature.  
Section 7. Residence Requirement

Company will maintain at the respective Headquarters a  
roster of certain employees likely to be called and will select  
from these lists on a rotating or cumulative overtime basis  
as applicable such available employees as are needed. The  
purpose of this arrangement is to provide an equitable dis-  
tribution of overtime work when required. Being subject to  
call-out is not to be considered as hours of work and no  
additional compensation will be paid to cover this respon-  
sibility. The Company will maintain records of overtime

tion; however, the employee will not accrue  
1600 or job seniority for time spent as a Su  
pervisor and they will not pay Union dues or  
remain on the call-out roster. In this situation,  
1600 or job seniority will not be a criteria for  
selection. In order to maintain rights in their  
former Union job, they must be returned to non-  
supervisory status within six (6) months of the  
temporary promotion. If they return after the  
six (6)-month period, they will be placed in an  
entry level position and for 1600 or job senior-  
ity purposes will only be considered to be  
ahead of other employees with less than Six  
(6) months of Company Service. It is further  
understood that the utilization of this provision  
is not intended to provide temporary supervi-  
sors on a continual basis to circumvent the  
creation of permanent supervisors.  
Non-supervisory employees temporarily pro-  
moted to supervisory positions as replace-  
ments for supervisors who are off duty wil! be  
selected basically by job seniority at the work  
location provided fitness and ability are sub-  
stantially equal. In this situation the employee  
will continue to accrue job Seniority, pay Union  
28  
Article V — Sec. 2  
dues, and remain on the call-out roster. Pay  
treatment will be in accordance with Article VI,  
Section 4, Paragraph A of this Agreement.  
(2) Permanent  
(a) Non-supervisory employees who are promoted  
to supervisory positions have a right to return  
to their former job classification at their former  
work location for a period of twelve (12) months  
following their promotion. However, the em-  
ployee will not accrue 1600 or job seniority for  
the time spent as a supervisor and they will  
not pay Union dues or remain on the call-out  
roster. in order to maintain rights in their former  
Union job, they must be returned to non-su-  
pervisory status within twelve (12} months of  
the promotion. If they return after the twelve  
(12)-month period, they will be placed in an  
entry level position and for 1600 seniority pur-  
poses will only be considered to be ahead of  
other employees with less than:six (6) months  
of Company Service.  
(b) When former non-supervisory employees  
have held a supervisory position for twelve (12)  
months or longer and are returned to non-su-  
pervisory jobs, for disability reasons only, they  
will be placed in such a manner as to be able  
to perform meaningful work without adversely  
affecting the job seniority or overtime of em-  
ployees in that line of progression. These  
cases will be referred to the Disability Com-  
mittee for resolution.  
D. (1) A transfer in this Paragraph D is defined as a  
change from one job to another in the same job  
classification and progression line.  
29  
Article V — Sec. 2  
(2) Employees cannot transfer to a job in the same  
progression line or change jobs to other progres-  
sion lines during the first six (6) months of em-  
ployment. Employees will be considered for pro-  
motions in their line of progression during the first  
six (6) months of employment based on their abil-  
ity and job seniority. For posted job vacancies,  
employees with less than six (6) months’ Com-  
pany Service may submit job bidding forms. How-  
ever, only employees who have attained six (6)  
months’ Company Service must be given consid-  
eration for the posted job.  
(3) Transfer requests shall be made in writing by  
(4  
  
the employee before a vacancy exists and em-  
ployees shall forward a copy to the Local Union  
Business Office. For seniority purposes, employ-  
ees requesting a transfer will be considered on  
the basis of their job seniority in comparison to  
the job seniority of employees in the next lower  
job classification in the progression line. Trans-  
ferred employees will retain their job seniority  
date for promotional purposes only.  
Employees with more than six (6) months Com-  
pany Service voluntarily requesting a transfer  
within the same job classification and same pro-  
gression line are restricted to one (1) transfer ev-  
ery five (5) years for each job classification. This  
applies to all job classifications and all pro-  
gression lines. No transfer requests will be al-  
lowed across progression lines.  
An employee who was displaced and obtains a  
iob at a different facility within their  
progression line will have no tiie limits for hon-  
oring transfer letters as long as they are

Article V — Sec. 2  
attempting to return to the facility they were  
originally displaced from. This would also ap-  
ply if they were attempting to return to any  
closer facility within their progression line. For  
example, if an employee was displaced from a  
job at the Harrisburg SC, and obtained a job in  
the placement process at the Newport SC, he  
would be allowed to submit transfer requests  
to either West Shore SC or Harrisburg SC with-  
out the five (5)-year restriction.  
Employees in the Office Jobs Concept with more  
than six (6) months Company Service requesting  
to change jobs to other progression lines must  
enter those progression lines at bottom entry level  
jobs. For seniority purposes, employees chang-  
ing jobs to other progression lines will receive a  
new job seniority date effective the start of the  
first pay period after notification of selection.  
Employees with more than six {6} months Com-  
pany Service transferring on posted job vacan-  
cies will not be restricted to the one (1) transfer  
rule. For seniority purposes, employees transfer-  
ring on a posted job vacancy within the same pro-  
gression line will retain their original job seniority  
date. Employees who change jobs to other pro-  
gression lines as a result of bidding on a posted  
job vacancy will receive a new job seniority date  
effective the start of the first pay period after noti-  
fication of selection.  
Voluntary return rights within the first six (6} months  
of a job change shall be restricted to progression  
line promotions and posted jobs. Employees who  
accept a posted position at a location and vol-  
untarily return during their probationary period  
31  
Article V — Sec. 2  
will not be permitted to rebid the same job clas-  
sification at that location for four (4) years.  
(8) Employees entering Apprenticeship Programs on  
or after August 2, 1982 are restricted from bid-  
ding into other Apprenticeship Programs after the  
six (6)-month probationary period has been  
completed.  
E. The Company may administer tests for determining  
the aptitudes of employees being considered for entry level  
positions and for entry into formal training programs. After  
suitable training, tests of achievement and ability may be  
administered for the purpose of determining qualifications  
for progression within formal training programs, and to com-  
ply with governmental regulations.  
Employees will not be required to successfully complete  
tests to retain a job classification unless periodic testing is  
specifically required as a part of a formal training program  
or by governmental regulations. If an employee success-  
fully performs a job for six (6) months within the past five  
(5) years without having taken the appropriate entry test(s),  
this test(s) will be waived for this employee.  
Employees who fail a minimum entry test two (2) times  
will be restricted from re-testing for a period of six (6)  
months from the date of the second test. If the employee  
can show the Company that they have made efforts to  
improve their skills, the six (6) month restriction will be  
waived.  
Employees who meet or exceed test cut-off scores will  
be considered to have passed the test on an equal basis,  
and will be considered for job openings in accordance with  
Article V, Section 2, Paragraph A of the Labor Agreement.  
The confidentiality of all tests shall be preserved and  
actual test questions, employee answer sheets and indi-  
vidual test scores will not be released by the Company.  
32  
Article V — Sec. 2  
The Company will review actual test questions and results  
with employees upon request, for ail skill assessment tests  
for purposes of identifying strengths and weaknesses.  
Upon request the-Company will continue its practice of  
reviewing the :areas of strengths and weaknesses related  
to aptitude’ tests: with employees.  
lf a question arises regarding test administration or the  
validity of a test relative to the job in question, it may be  
submitted through the Grievance Procedure of Article Ill for  
resolution. It is further understood that tests and agreements  
on testing reached prior to August 2, 1982 will remain in  
effect and for the purpose of filling job vacancies, the Com-  
pany may administer tests to determine job qualifications,  
which will be discussed with the Union prior to implementa-  
tion. Any resulting disputes may be submitted through the  
Grievance Procedure.  
If an employee voluntarily quits, or was discharged  
for cause, and is rehired, he will not receive credit for his .  
previous period of Company Service. If an employee is re-  
employed within two (2) years after layoff, he will receive  
credit for Company Service and 1600 Seniority, but will be  
given a new job seniority date.  
G. Seniority will not be considered when it is necessary  
fo rearrange temporarily an employee’s duties to meet an  
emergency.  
H. The Company will notify the Local Union President  
before the effective date of any promotion, transfer, demo-  
tion or lay off. If a disagreement arises concerning the  
decision involving fitness, ability and/or senior-  
ity, such disagreement may be submitted under Articte [I] of  
this Agreement.  
l The Company will provide the Union with monthly  
compuier updates of employee information as agreed to in  
the Memorandum of Agreement signed April 6, 1987.  
33  
Article V — Sec. 2  
J. If an employee, selected to fill a job vacancy, is de-  
layed in reporting to such job because the Company is un-  
able to release him, he will be credited with seniority from  
the start of the first pay period after the notification of his  
selection. {f the new job represents a promotion for the-em-  
ployee, the employee will receive the appropriate pay credit  
two (2) pay periods following the start of seniority credit,  
and will be considered on probation for a period of six (6)  
months from the day the employee reports to the new job.  
In the event the new job represents a transfer or demotion,  
the employee will receive the appropriate pay credit and  
begin the six (6) months probationary period at the time the  
employee actually reports fo the new job.  
K. Voluntary and involuntary job changes shall be handled  
as follows:  
(1) When employees voluntarily or involuntarily  
demote in the same line of progression during the  
- six (6) months’ probationary period, they will de-  
mote to their former job classification at their former  
work location. They will receive job seniority in the  
lower classification for all time spent in the higher  
classification. Employees voluntarily or involun-  
tarily returning from a job in another line of pro-  
gression during the six (6) months’ probationary  
period will return to the job classification at the work  
location where they last satisfactorily completed  
their probationary period. Employees voluntarily  
returning will receive no seniority credit in the job  
they return to for the time spent in the other pro-  
gression line. However, seniority credit will be re-  
sumed starting with the first pay period after re-  
ceipt of their written request to return. Employees  
invoiuniarily returming will receive seniority credit  
in the job they return to for the time spent in the  
other progression line.  
34  
Article V — Sec. 2  
(2) When employees involuntarily demote in their pro-  
(3  
~~  
——  
gression line after the six (6) months’ probation-  
ary period for reasons other than displacements,  
they will return to the next lower job classification  
they are capable of performing satisfactorily, which  
may result in subsequent promotions for other  
employees in the line of Progression, unless a  
vacancy exists in the lower classification. Employ-  
ees will receive job seniority credit in the lower job  
Classification for the time spent in the higher clas-  
sification.  
When it is necessary to involuntarily return em-  
ployees to jobs outside their Progression line after  
the six (6) months’ probationary period, consider-  
ation will be given to the employee's previous Com-  
pany Service and experience. New seniority date  
for progression line and/or department service  
shall be established effective the date of the  
return. If such employees are returned  
to the job they previously held because a non-su-  
pervisory employee promoted to a supervisory  
position and subsequently returns within twelve  
(12) months of that promotion, the returned em-  
ployee will receive seniority credit in the job they  
return to for the time spent in the other progres-  
sion line.  
To demote voluntarily after the six (6) months’ pro-  
bationary period, employees May request to be  
placed in a vacancy in a lower job classification in  
the progression line they held, un-  
less the lower job was not in the progression line  
when the employee promoted to the higher job. in  
this instance, the employee can demote to a posi-  
tion they did not hold. if a vacancy is not available  
35  
L. Po  
When  
Article V — Sec. 2  
and it is possible to demote the employee to a job  
classification he satisfactorily held in the progres-  
sion line through subsequent promotions in the  
progression line, with the approval of the Com-  
pany and Local Union Office, such a move may be  
initiated. For job seniority purposes, the employee  
will receive no seniority credit in the lower classifi-  
cation for time spent.in the higher classification.  
However, if the employee subsequently promotes  
to the higher classification, he will be credited with  
the time previously held in the higher classifica-  
tion.  
When a vacancy occurs within a progression line  
and employee requests for demotion and/or trans-  
fer are on record prior to the vacancy, they will be  
considered along with promotional candidates.  
Employees shall forward a copy of the demotion  
or transfer request to the Local Union Business  
Office. For seniority purposes, the consideration  
order will be determined by comparing their job  
seniority in their respective job classifications. The  
employee with the greatest job seniority date will  
receive first consideration.

DEFERRED STEP INCREASES: Step increases for em-  
ployees who have been off duty for one (1) pay period or  
reasons. other than vacation, of step increases for  
employees on modified duty who are not performing the pri-  
mary duties of their job description will be postponed for a  
corresponding period.  
J. UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE:  
(1) Any employee who is.not performing satisfactorily  
in his job will be subject to demotion and, in un-  
usual cases, to discharge. lf he is an employee  
who has completed his period of probation but has  
not reached the maximum rate for his job, he will,  
if his progress in the job is unsatisfactory, also be  
subject to having his step increases held up until  
satisfactory progress is shown.  
No action will be taken in accordance with the  
above until the employee has been forewarned by  
. his supervisor and the reasons why his perfor-  
mance or progress is considered unsatisfactory  
fully explained to him. tn all such cases, the  
- Union’s accredited representative will be kept in-  
formed regarding the employee's siatus and any  
contemplated change in his status.

possible, and shall have his salary reduced in 25%  
increments every 6 months for a period of 18  
months in order to reach the appropriate rate of  
pay of the lower job. The first reduction will occur  
when the employee physically reports to the job.  
When it is necessary to demote an employee be-  
cause he has failed to meet the job requirements  
while on probation or upon completion of a tem-  
porary job, his salary rate will be reduced to the  
step he would have attained in his former job. The  
reduction in salary rate will be made immediately  
upon the employee assuming the duties of the  
lower job. The same procedure will apply when  
the demotion to his former job classification is at  
his request and for his personal advantage during  
the probationary period.  
When employees demote after the probationary  
period, their salary will be reduced to the step for  
which their Company Service qualifies them or the  
next lower step rate below their present rate which-  
ever is less except as provided in Article V, Section  
2, Paragraph P. The reduction in salary will be made  
immediately upon the employees assuming the  
duties of the lower job and subsequent step in-  
creases will follow in six (6) months or be deter-  
mined dy their Company Service depending on  
the method used to determine the rate.

ary 1 to March 31 of each year shall be prepared on or  
before November 1 of the preceding year. Schedules cov-  
ering the period from April 1 to December 31 shall be pre-  
pared on or before March 1 of that year. These schedules  
shall be considered tentative and may be modified by, or  
with the approval of, the Department Head as unforeseen  
conditions develop.  
B. These schedules shall be prepared by the Depart-  
ment Head using as a basis dates (first, second and third  
choices) selected by the employees. It shall be the respon-  
sibility of the Department Head to schedule these vacations  
throughout the entire year in order that the Company’s busi-  
ness and operation may continue in an efficient manner.  
Whenever there is a conflict in dates, it will become a matter  
to be straightened out between the employees involved. If  
this procedure fails, the Department Head will decide the  
matter, taking into consideration length of service of the em-  
ployees involved, the reasonableness of each employee's  
claim to the particular time, the settlement of similar con-  
flicts in previous years and all other pertinent factors.  
C. A vacation may begin at any time provided it is prop-  
erly coordinated with the vacation periods of other employ-  
ees involved.

tions may be split into periods of not fess than eight (8) sched-  
uled hours, with the approval of the Department Head.  
E. All scheduled hours elapsing while an employee is on

cember 31 of any current calendar year, or the next preced-  
ing work day to such daté, and whose employment with the  
Company does not terminate on such day, and employees  
laid off December 31 shall be entitled in the next succeed-  
ing calendar year to the same vacation period, including  
longevity allowance, to which he was entitled during the said  
current calendar year. However, an employee who initially  
during such succeeding calendar year becomes entitled to  
increased vacation or longevity allowance under Paragraph  
A of Section 1 of this Article VII, upon meeting the eligibility  
requirements of said Sections shall be entitled to the vaca-  
tion allowance therein provided.  
H. In event of termination of employment of an employee  
for any cause prior to taking of the full vacation allowance or  
payment of longevity allowance to which he is entitled as  
provided in the next preceding Paragraph, such employee  
shall be paid the longevity allowance, if any, and an amount  
of vacation pay (as defined in Section 1 C of this Article  
in of such vacation allowance equivalent to the pay which  
he would have received in respect of such vacation period  
or the part thereof not completed, had such vacation been  
taken immediately prior to such employment termination. In

This allowance shall be determined by applying to his regu-  
lar vacation and longevity entitlement for the current calen-  
dar year the same ratio as the number of full calendar months  
worked in the current calendar year bears to twelve (12)  
months and rounding the result to the nearest multiple of  
eight (8) hours. For the purpose of this Paragraph, an em-  
ployee whose employment terminates because of long term  
disability shall be considered as one who retires. An addi-  
tional allowance determined in the same manner will be paid  
to the person legally entitled thereto for an employee who  
dies.  
J. Except as provided in Section 3 K of this Article, vaca-  
tion allowance not taken in the calendar year during which  
the employee is entitled thereto cannot be accumulated and  
added to the vacation allowance of succeeding year or years  
unless the employee was prevented from taking his full va-  
cation allowance because of illness, injury or at supervisory  
request with mutual agreement. Unused vacation allowance  
as a result of illness or injury shall be taken as soon as it  
can be scheduled after the first full pay period following the  
return to work; and in the case of supervisory  
request, within the first three (3) months of the succeeding  
calendar year. When an employee is permitted to take such  
vacation, it shall not be considered part of the employee's  
vacation entitlement for any succeeding calendar year un-  
der the provisions of Section 3 G of this Article.  
K. An employee with a period of employment of eight (8)  
or more years, subject to the approval of the Department  
Head, may elect not to take all his vacation allowance in the  
calendar year in which he is entitled thereto but may elect to  
carry over vacation allowance into the succeeding calendar  
year under the following conditions:  
(1) Aminimum of forty (40) hours (five (5) days) must  
be carried over and taken in one period within the

year.  
Eligible employees shall indicate their intent  
to carry over vacation as early as possible  
in the current year ul, in no event, later than No-  
vember 1.  
(3) When an employee is permitted to take such va-  
cation, it shall not be considered part of the  
employee’s vacation entitlement for any succeed-  
ing calendar year under the provisions of Section  
3 G of this Article.  
L. (1) When an employee is off duty because of sick-  
ness or injury at the time his vacation is sched-  
uled to begin, the vacation may be rescheduled.  
Employees who become hospitalized while on va-  
cation may reschedule that portion of their vaca-  
tion which was spent in the hospital, provided the  
‘hospitalization was of more than one (1) day’s  
duration and a hospital certificate containing the  
admission and release dates is submitted to the  
Company.  
When sickness or injury occurs after scheduled  
vacation has begun and the period ex-  
tends into the succeeding work week(s), the va-  
_ cation scheduled for the succeeding work week(s)

### ARTICLE VII  
### . GENERAL PROVISIONS |  
### 
Section 1. Sick Pay |  
A. Sick pay allowances will be determined by multiplying  
an individual’s number of full years of Company Service  
completed, up to a maximum of thirty (30), times eighty (80)  
_ hours, and subtracting from this total the number of hours  
- allowed with pay for sickness or injury in the preceding seven  
(7) calendar years and the current year to date. The net hours  
derived from: this calculation, up to a maximum of 2400, .  
represent the number of hours that may be allowed to the  
employee for time off due to a non-occupational illness or  
injury. The day an employee becomes ill is the date from  
which the sick pay entitlement for that period of disability is  
57  
Anticte Vill — Sec. 1  
determined. Therefore, when a disabled employee crosses  
an anniversary date of Company Service or the date when  
the seven-year history under the Plan is updated, any addi-  
tional entitlement is not available for the period of disability  
_already in progress. However, the additional entitlement is  
available for future absences upon the employee’s return to  
work.  
B. To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must have  
completed’ a period of employment of six (6) months and  
have properly reported the cause of the absence in accor-  
dance with established procedures. New employees who  
complete their six (6)-month probationary period will be  
eligible to borrow forty (40) hours of sick pay from the  
eighty (80).hours that they will be entitled to after one  
year of employment.  
C. All cases of iliness or injury must be bona fide. If there  
is a question regarding the nature of the illness or injury,  
medical certification may be required. False claim for sick  
pay shail subject employees to disciplinary action.  
D. Employees are required to furnish medical certifica-  
tion of illness for all absences in excess of five (5) in a pay  
period year. Employees returning to work from the sixth oc-  
illness, and each subsequent illness within the  
year, without proper certification, shall have the period of  
absence charged to “Time Off Without Pay - No Permis-  
sion.”  
(1) Employees scheduled to work either Saturday or  
‘Sunday, who are ill on one or both of these days,  
and properly report off, shall have up to a maxi- .  
mum of forty-eight (48) hours to obtain medical  
certification for the sixth occurrence of illness and  
thereafter.  
E. Employees will be notified when they have depleted  
approximately 80% of their sick pay and employees who  
58  
Article Vill — Sec. 1  
have utilized their full sick pay allowance will be consid-  
ered for further sick pay on the earlier of the next anniver-  
sary of their Company Service date or on January 1st fol-  
lowing the adjustment of their seven (7) year history.  
F The Company will pay the difference between the  
employee's full pay and the amount paid by Workers’ Com-  
pensation for employees absent from work due to occupa-  
‘tional disease or injury. The amount of time available for  
such allowances will be calculated in the same manner as  
basic sick pay under Paragraph A above. When such allow-  
ances are exhausted, employees will receive Workers Com-  
pensation and/or Long Term Disability payments in accor-  
ance with the eligibility requirements of those programs.  
_ (1) To be eligible for such payments, employees ab-  
sent from work due to occupational injury must  
properly notify the Company of an accident before  
the end of the W-day during which it occurs, or at  
the beginning of the next W-day if the injury oc-  
curs during non-scheduled hours in the absence  
of a supervisor. Occupational! disease must be  
reported as soon as possible but no later than forty-  
eight (48) hours after the onset of the disease to  
be eligible for the payments provided in this Para-  
graph.  
G. Employees who exhaust their full allowances for ill-  
ness or injury under Paragraphs A and F above, and who  
are not on leave of absence, will be retained on Company  
records on a no-pay status for purposes of continuing eligi-  
bility for employee benefit plans for a period of time that,  
combined with the exhausted allowances, does not ex-  
ceed 26 continuous weeks of absence from work.  
H. Employees with more than one (1) year of Company  
Service who have had no time off with or without pay under the

factors and giving due emphasis to the length of service,  
pay and regular job, shall place the employee as advanta-  
geously as possible into a vacant position in which the  
employee is able to perform the essentia! functions satis-  
factorily. The disabled employee being reassigned by ac-  
tion of the Disability Committee will be given preference  
over any other employees, with less 1600 Seniority, for any  
vacancy they are capable of filling. The Joint Disability Com-  
mittee will have access to Sections 1, 2, 4, or 8 of Articie X to  
74

shall be examined by an impartial physician or specialist  
selected by the Joint Committee and paid for by the Com-  
pany. Employees will be provided meaningful work within  
their limitations and consistent with their current rate of pay  
until placement by the Committee.  
If the Committee is unable to resolve a particular issue  
brought to it within 90 calendar days after the Committee  
receives all information pertaining to the case, the employee  
will be temporarily placed in the title of “Utility Person” until  
such time as the Committee places the employee in an avail-  
able job consistent with the employee's capabilities. Place-  
ment in the “Utility Person” classification will be on an in-  
cumbent only basis. Duties assigned to such individuals will  
vary depending upon their capabilities. The rate of pay shall  
be the same as that paid other employees for comparable  
assignments except as provided in Paragraphs B and C of  
this Section 10.  
Employees in the “Utility Person” classification will be pro-  
vided on-the-job training as the circumstances justify to im-  
prove their future job prospects.  
Any unilateral placement by the Company without con-  
currence of the Committee may be submitted to arbitration  
in accordance with Article II] of the Labor Agreement.  
After having been placed in another job by the Disability  
Committee, employees with twenty (20) or more years of  
service will not be subject to further demotion, because of  
such disability, as long as they remain at work. However,  
when circumstances warrant, they may be reassigned other  
duties.

Article Vili— Sec. 114  
When a promotional opportunity occurs, the Company  
will contact the employee who is off duty to determine if he  
is interested in the vacancy. If the employee elects to pro-  
mote and is accepted, the vacancy will be filled on a tempo-  
rary basis and will be held for the employee. The employee's  
former job will then be filled on a permanent basis.  
If additional promotional opportunities occur, the em-  
ployee must again be contacted. Only one (1) job will be  
held for an employee; i.e., if he accepts a second promo-  
tion, the first one he accepted will be filled by another em-  
ployee on a permanent basis.  
When a promotion is held for an employee, the appropri-  
ate pay credit and six (6) months’ probationary period will  
begin at the time the employee actually reports to the new  
job. The employee will be credited with job seniority from  
the start of the first pay period after notification of selection.

duty for one pay period or more for reasons of illness or  
temporary disability or step increases for employees on  
modified duty who are not performing the primary duties of  
their job description will be postponed for a corresponding  
period. Additionally, general wage increases for employ-  
ees off duty for one pay period or more for such reasons  
will be deferred until the employee returns to full duty un-  
less the employee is on modified duty as the result of an  
on-the-job accident in which case the employee will re-  
ceive the general wage increase applicable to the job the  
employee is performing.

non-supervisory work which interferes with his supervisory  
responsibilities or results in the elimination of a non-super-  
visory job. A supervisor shall not do the work ordinarily per-  
formed by a non-supervisory employee solely to prevent

### MILITARY SERVICE  
### 
Section 1. Genera!  
A. The Company and the Union have agreed on a de-  
tailed plan for employees who enter and return from military  
service, which meets the reemployment provisions of the  
Universal Military Training Act as amended by the Vietnam  
Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. The  
Company will grant military leave and intends to treat every  
employee returning from military service, insofar as pos-  
sible, as though there had been no interruption in his em-  
ployment.  
79  
Article IX — Sec. 2  
Section 2. Leave of Absence  
A Employees who enter military service will be consid- 4  
ered to be on military leave for the period and under condi-  
tions prescribed by law. Although the law makes no provi-  
sion for employees entering the Merchant Marine, the Com-  
pany will give due consideration, with respect to leave of  
absence, to each such case. .  
B. In order that employees entering the military have  
time off to settle personal affairs before leaving for mili-  
tary service, they will be allowed time off with pay as  
follows:  
(1) When enlisting or drafted as an active employee  
for the first time — up to 5 work days off  
(2) Mandatory periodic training — no days off  
(3) Call-up to active duty for less than 60 days—up  
to 3 work days off  
(4) Call-up to active duty for 60 days or more — up  
to 5 work days off  
Time off with pay for employees who volunteer for  
active duty wiil be reviewed by the parties on a case-by-  
case basis. Each employee entering military service will  
be entitled to the same vacation allowance as he would be  
if he were voluntarily leaving the Company. If he should  
need more time without pay for this purpose, his leave wiil  
start at a mutually agreeable earlier date.  
C. An employee entering military service will be paid in  
full, for time worked and allowed with pay, on the day he is  
released from duty with the Company or as soon thereafter  
as practicable.  
D. The entire cost of the Group Life Insurance of a par-  
ticipating employee entering military service will be borne  
by the Company for a period of two (2) calendar months

a Group Life Insurance coverage will cease. However, the  
¥/ employee's life insurance will be paid in the-event of his  
death during the following thirty-one (31)-day period. Dur-  
ing such two (2) calendar months and during such thirty-  
one (31)-day period, he has the privilege of converting ail or  
part of his Group Life Insurance, without medical examina-  
tion, to a regular policy.  
E. Employees who enter military service will have their  
participation in the Retirement Plan suspended until their  
return to active employment. Benefit entitlement for employ-  
ees who do not return to active employment will be deter-  
mined in accordance with the termination of employment  
provisions of the Pian.  
Section 3. Reinstatement  
_ A. Employees who return from military service and com-  
ply with the reemployment provisions of the Act will be re-  
stored to their former positions, or to positions of like senior-  
ity, status and pay, unless circumstances have so changed  
as to make it or unreasonable. In addition, such  
employees will:  
(1) Be credited with the time they were in military ser-  
vice in determining their position on the salary  
tables.  
(2) Be given promotions to such jobs in the regular  
line of progression as may have become vacant  
during their absence, provided that they are quali-  
fied and would have been selected by Manage-  
; ment as the logical persons to fill the jobs.  
(3) If pay is based on salary tables, the promotion date  
for determining the salary table step will be the  
date or dates the employee who replaced the vet-  
    
   
81  
Article [IX — Sec. 3 i  
eran was promoted. if such dates are not avail- 33 ot  
able, the promotion date for determining the sal- ER  
ary table step will be the date the veteran starts in: a  
the higher job.  
- If pay is based on wage tables, the pay will be the present  
hourly pay for the job to which the veteran is promoted.  
B. in order for an employee returning from military ser-  
vice to be eligible for the benefits under this Plan, he must:  
(1) Have left a position other than a temporary posi-  
tion.  
(2) Have a certificate of satisfactory completion of such  
training and service.  
(3) Be qualified to perform the duties of such posi-  
tion.  
(4) Apply for reemployment within ninety (90) days

‘t=  
  
not qualified to perform the duties of his former position by )  
reason of disability sustained during such service but quali- $  
fied to perform the duties of any other positions will be  
restored to such other position as will provide him with like  
seniority, status and pay or to a position which is the near-  
est approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances  
in the case.  
D. Group Life Insurance Plan:  
An employee returning from military service will be eli-  
gible for the regular amount of insurance based on his an-  
nual earnings.

nity to receive the same retirement benefits un-  
der the Plan as if there had been no interruption  
in employment.  
lf contributions were required under the Plan dur-  
ing any the employee’s absence, the em-  
ployee will be able to receive contributory credit  
for that time provided the employee pays the  
monthly contributions which were not made dur-  
ing the leave.  
F. Vacation and Longevity Allowance:  
The time spent in military service will be counted as a  
period of employment with the Company in determining va-  
cation and longevity allowance.

programs as long as there is a need for the training and  
will establish new programs as needed in order that

### Section 5. Periodic Military Training  
### 
A Where an employee who is a member of a reserve  
military organization of the United States requires absence  
from work in order to attend a mandatory training period,  
the Company will, in any calendar year, grant such employee  
a leave of absence of up to two (2) weeks (eighty (80) sched-  
uled hours) and will pay such employee the difference be-  
tween the regular pay he would have received if he had  
worked and his Government pay. To the extent that the man-  
datory training period exceeds two (2) weeks, the Company  
will grant additional time off without pay.  

### ARTICLE X  
### PLACEMENT PROCESS  
### 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this Article is to provide op-  
portunities for the placement of displaced employees and  
eliminate temporary letters while streamlining the placement  
process. It is not intended solely to provide severance, lay-  
off or retirement opportunities for employees who have not  
been affected by this process:  
The company will identify the job classification and loca-  
tion of the excess position(s). The Labor Relations Depart-  
ment will give 10 working days notice to the Local 1600  
Union Office of any decision to displace employees as a  
result of a reduction, elimination or reassignment of work,  
during which the following procedures will apply.  
NOTE: See the end of this Article X for a Flow Chart of the  
Piacement Process.

been bumped by this process may retire if eligible, elect  
enhanced severance, select layoff or proceed through the  
placement process. Employees who retire will be eligible  
for benefits as described below. Employees will have 5 work-  
ing days from receiving retirement/severance information  
to make a decision.  
(1) Voluntary Early Retirement for Employees Identi-  
fied in the Placement Process.  
Employees who are displaced, bumped or qualify  
as volunteers for displacement will be eligible for  
special early retirement benefits if they have at-  
tained age 55 or over at any time prior to place-  
ment. Qualified employees will receive the follow-

ment equal to 17.5% of their final monthly  
base salary from the date of termination  
until eligibility for the limited SSI benefit  
(presently age 62) has been reached.

ment equal to 4.5% of their final monthly  
base salary from the point of eligibility of  
the limited SSI benefit until the point of eli-  
gibility of the full SSI benefit (presently ages  
62 and 65).

proved by the company as the effective  
date, taking into consideration the availabil-  
ity of qualified replacements, an orderly  
transition of duties and the employees’ pref-  
erences.  
(3) Enhanced Severance for Employees Identified in  
the Placement Process  
Employees who are displaced, bumped or qualify  
as volunteers for displacement, and who are not  
eligible for or do not elect to retire, will be eligible  
for enhanced severance benefits regardless of  
their age or years of 1600 Seniority.

appropriate level, no further action is required.  
(4) NOTES:  
(a) Reemployment rights will only apply to the  
layoff provision.  
(b) Employees will be handled in the process  
below in order of their Local 1600 Senior-  
ity. ~  
(c) Ifa vacancy is available in the same clas-  
sification at the same location, the em-  
ployee will be placed in the vacancy and  
no further action is required.  
Section 2. Box 2  
Canvass the displaced employee’s progression line at  
the same location for volunteers to retire/sever to create an  
appropriate vacancy. An appropriate vacancy is a job at the  
same classification which the displaced employee must ac-  
cept, or a lower or higher job in the progression line that the  
displaced employee is willing to accept. Employees who  
volunteer to retire to create an appropriate vacancy will re-  
ceive the supplemental retirement benefits, as listed above,  
if they are at least 55 years of age.  
. & ‘fan appropriate vacancy exists in the same job clas-  
sification at the same location, the process ends.  
_ B. The canvass for volunteers will last no more than 5  
working days from the day the employee receives the vol-  
unteer form.  
C. The volunteer will have 5 working days to accept the  
offer of retirement/severance after receiving their benefit infor-  
mation from the Company. These days will run concurrently.  
87  
Article X — Sec. 2-4  
D. Any vacancies created through this process will be  
filled by a progression line promotion. Employees will have  
24 hours to accept or decline the promotion.  
E. If a vacancy occurs at a higher level, fill through a  
progression line canvass. If a displaced employee declines  
the promotion and no one in the progression line wants the  
job, then move to Box 6 without red tag.  
If someone in the lower job takes the promotion and the  
displaced employee is willing to roll back, he will take the  
lower job rate of pay through pay tapering.  
F. If more than one employee at a work location volun-  
teers for retirement or severance, the most senior employee  
(1600 Seniority) who would create an appropriate vacancy  
for the displaced employee may retire or sever.  
Section 3. Box 3  
lf the displaced employee has not been placed in Box 2,  
the displaced employee will bump the most junior employee  
(1600 Seniority) in the same classification at their current  
work location.  
A. employee will be handled as follows:  
(1) All employees on the property as of May 18,  
1998 will have full access to this placement  
process when they reach 10 years. Until that  
time, the employee will have LIFO*.  
(2) All employees hired after May 18, 1998 will  
have LIFO* until they reach 15 years, at which  
time they will have full access to the place-  
ment process.  
Section 4. Box 4  
If Box 3 is not available, and if the displaced employee  
chooses a preferred location, canvass other preferred work  
88  
Article X — Sec. 4-7  
locations in the same progression line for volunteers in the  
same rate or classification to retire or sever. The resulting  
vacancy must be at a location in a classification desig-  
nated by the displaced employee. If a vacancy is created,  
the displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and  
the process ends.  
OR  
Section 5. Box §  
If Box 4 is not available or no location is selected, the  
displaced employee may bump the most junior employee  
(1600 Seniority) at the next closest work location where the  
same classification exists, in the same Progression line.  
OR  
Section 6. Box 6  
At the same location, the displaced empioyee may roll-  
back to next lower job in their Progression line and bump  
the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in that classifica-  
tion at 100% red-tag. However, those employees who de-  
cline a promotion in Section 2 Paragraph E will be pay ta-  
péered to the rate of pay for the job. If this option is available,  
but the employee declines and chooses to go to Box 8, the  
employee loses red-tag rate of pay. If this option is not  
available, go to Box 7 with 100% red-tag.  
Section 7. Box 7  
At the next closest work location where lower jobs exist  
in the progression line, the displaced employee may roll-  
back to the next lower job in their progression line that the  
displaced employee’s 1600 Seniority will allow and bump  
the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in that classifi-  
cation at 100% red-tag. However, those employees who  
decline a promotion in Section 2 Paragraph E will be pay  
tapered to the rate of pay for the job. If this option is not  
89  
Article X — Sec. 7-8  
available or not selected, the employee moves to Box 8  
with a 100% red-tag rate of pay.  
Section 8. Box 8  
Canvass all employees for volunteers to retire or sever.  
From this list, the displaced employee can select up to 5  
progression lines designating job classifications and loca-  
tions they are willing to accept. If a vacancy is created, the  
displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and the  
process ends.  
A. Step 1 - In determining eligibility compare the dis-  
placed employee’s 1600 Seniority to the 1600  
Seniority of the employee in the progression line  
who would be eligible to promote to the vacancy  
created by the volunteer. If the displaced employee  
has the 1600 Seniority and qualifications, they take  
the vacancy and allow the volunteer to leave.  
B. Step 2 - If the displaced employee does not have  
the 1600 Seniority and qualifications to fill the job  
of the volunteer, and has designated the next lower  
job as one of their preferences, fill the vacancy  
through a progression line promotion and then  
compare the 1600 Seniority of the displaced em-  
ployee to the 1600 Seniority of the employee in  
the progression line who would be eligible to pro-  
mote to the resulting vacancy. !f the displaced  
employee has the 1600 Seniority and qualifica-  
_ tions, they take the vacancy and allow the volun-  
teer to leave.  
C. Step 3 - If necessary, continue this process until  
the displaced employee fits somewhere in the pro-  
gression line where there is a volunteer holding a  
job designated by the employee.  
90  
Article X — Sec. 8-10  
If the displaced employee cannot fit into any des-  
ignated job in the progression line, then there is  
no appropriate vacancy created and therefore the  
volunteer cannot leave. |  
(1) If Box 6 is available and the employee  
elects to go to Box 9, there will be no red-  
tag rate of pay.  
(2) If Boxes 6, 7, or 8 are unavailable or no  
selection is made in Box 7 or no progres-  
sion line selected in Box 8, the employee  
can select from Box 9 at 100% red-tag.  
OR  
Section 9. Box 9  
If the employee is not handled in Box 8, he then moves to  
Box 9 selecting a bumpable level job (B-04 and below) by  
1600 Seniority or moves to Box 10.  
A. |fBox 6 is available and the employee elects to go  
to Box 10, the employee will assume the rate of  
the selected job through the pay tapering process.  
B. If Box 7 is unavailable or no location was selected, or  
if Box 8 was unavailable or no progression line se-  
lected or no job was selected in Box 9, the employee  
moves to Box 10 with 100% red-tag rate of pay.  
OR  
Section 10. Box 10  
Bump LIFO* employee based on 1600 Seniority and  
qualifications. The Union will handle employees in Box 10  
within 30 days of the date the last displaced employee  
reaches Box 10. Employees displaced after the 30-day clock  
starts, if eligible, can go through Boxes 1 to 9 and wait until  
the current employees in Box 10 are handled. Both parties  
agree to cooperate in the administration of this process. All  
employees’ pay and expenses will be paid in accordance  
91  
Article X — Sec,10—11  
with the labor agreement. Employees not handled in Box  
10, and who are eligible for a company offer as defined  
below, will move to Box 11. |  
Section 11. Box 11  
Except as provided in this section, no regular, full-time  
employee hired prior to May 18, 1998 who has attained ten  
(10) or more years of 1600 Seniority, or hired after May 18,  
14998 who has attained fifteen (15) or more years of 1600  
Seniority, shall be laid off because of a reduction, elimina-  
tion or reassignment of work, unless the employee has ex-  
ercised all of his rights under the placement process. In the  
event of such a reduction, elimination or reassignment of  
work, the employee will have access to the placement pro-  
cess stated above with pay protection signified by the term  
“red-tag”. If the employee utilizes the placement process  
without securing a job, the company will select for the af-  
fected employee a job, which may then be available any-  
where within the bargaining unit. If the employee selects  
this offer, their pay will be red-tagged unless previously lost  
in the placement process. In making such selection, the  
Company will consider the qualifications of the employee,

Section 12. Notes  
A. If the employee is bumped in Boxes 3 to 9, go to  
Paragraph A for processing.  
B. If the empioyee is bumped in Box 10 (LIFO em-  
ployee), the employee can bump only those with  
less 1600 Seniority than he has.  
C. A displaced or bumped employee can elect en-  
hanced severance/layoff/retirement at any step of  
the process.  
D. Any vacancy not created by this process will be  
filled in the following sequence: 1) recall of dis-  
placed employee, 2} progression line promotion/  
demotion (includes transfers), and 3) post. If a dis-  
placed employee is the successful bidder and still  
has their red-tag, they will be awarded the bid job  
at their 100% red-tag rate of pay or at the rate of  
the job if it is higher. If the employee voluntarily  
leaves this bid job during the probationary period,  
the employee then becomes displaced and loses  
the red-tag rate of pay. If the employee involun-  
tarily leaves the bid job, they will keep their 100%  
red-tag rate of pay.  
E Employees who reject the Company offer in Box  
11 or are unable to select a position in Box 10 will  
retain their Article Il rights.  
. Section 13. Associated Issues  
A. Recall Rights - employees who are displaced will  
retain recall rights to their former progression line  
from which they were displaced for a period of 4  
years as provided below. The demotion criteria  
are no longer applicable for recall.  
93  
Article X — Sec. 13  
Employees may be considered for vacancies de-  
clared by the Company in either higher, equal or  
lower job classifications in their former progres-  
sion line, based on the following order of consid-  
eration:  
(1) Same Job Classification - Employees who held  
the vacant job classifications prior to their  
placement in another progression line. Em-  
ployees will be considered based on their Lo-  
cal 1600 Seniority ranking. Employees recalled  
to their former job will have their previous job  
seniority date restored.  
Higher or Lower Job Classification - Fill through  
normal progression line promotion/demotion  
rules. Fill subsequent vacancies through #1  
above.  
Employees with return rights may request to  
be placed in their former progression line in a  
vacancy in a higher or lower job classification  
than the one from which they had been dis-  
placed if the vacancy is not filled through nor-  
mal progression line rules. Empioyees will be  
considered based on their Local 1600 Senior-  
ity. Recall rights will be satisfied if the em-  
ployee returns to a higher or lower job in the  
progression line.  
These opportunities remain in effect for a pe-  
riod of four years from the date the employee  
accrues job classification seniority in another  
progression line, regardless of the number of  
opportunities extended. However, an em-  
ployee who refuses recall back to their former  
job at their former work location will lose their  
recall rights.  
(2  
~~  
94  
Anicle X — Sec. 13  
Returning employees who accept a lower.  
level job in their former progression line will  
receive job classification seniority credit for  
the time previously spent in that job classifi-  
cation and will retain their red-tagged rate of  
pay, if applicable.  
(3) In the event the vacancy is not filled pursuant  
to Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, it will then be  
posted. If it cannot be filled through the post-  
ing process it will be filled through the reem-  
ployment provisions. |  
. Reemployment - employees, who have been laid  
off, shall have reemployment rights for 2 years.  
An employee who refuses a reemployment offer  
to their former job at their former location will be  
considered to be resigned.  
Red-tag - The term Red-tag shall mean the  
regular rate of pay shall not be reduced  
from that which he received in his former job and he  
will receive all applicable pay increases or portions  
thereof when the maximum rate of the job he is  
performing equals or exceeds such pay. Employ-  
ees who are red-tagged and subsequently bid to a  
new progression line will retain their red-tagged  
rate if any of the jobs in that progression line are  
equal to or higher than their current position. Such  
employees who return to their former job during  
their probationary period will retain their red-tagged  
rate of pay. If a red-tagged employee bids to a pro-  
gression line/job with no equal or higher job, they  
will lose their red-tag and wiil assume the rate of  
the new job. Such employees who return to their  
former job during their probationary period will lose  
their red-tagged rate of pay. Comparisons will be at  
95  
Article X — Sec. 13

equal or higher level job.

case basis.  
Pay Taper - employees who have been demoted  
and who are not red-tagged in connection with a  
job change as a result of the placement process  
shall have their salary reduced in 25% increments  
every 6 months for a period of 18 months in order  
to reach the appropriate rate of pay of the lower  
job. The first reduction will occur when the em-  
ployee physically reports to the job.  
. Temporary Assignments - displaced employees  
who are temporarily assigned to a higher rated  
job will be paid the higher salary after four (4) pay  
periods of reporting to the job. Displaced employ-  
ees who are assigned to an equal or lower job  
will continue to receive their current rate of pay.

handled under the placement process will not be  
required to move to accept a job with residence

Section 3. Staffing  
A. Temporary Furlough  
In the event the workload declines to a level where there  
is a need to reduce the workforce, management will iden-  
tify the excess employees by job classification and roster  
location. The necessary reductions will be made in the fol-  
lowing manner:  
1.  
Voluntary Furloughs: Employees at the identified  
roster location may volunteer for temporary fur-  
lough and they will be released on the basis of  
their job classification seniority, with senior em-  
ployee given first choice. Second preference to  
volunteer will be given to employees in the same  
progression line at other roster locations and they  
will be released on the basis of their job classifica-  
tion seniority, with senior employee given first  
choice. Such temporary furloughs will be for spe-  
cific time durations and volunteers will return no  
later than the specified ending date. There is no  
limit on voluntary furloughs.  
118  
Article XIl— Sec. 3  
2. Rollbacks: If there are not enough volunteers, em-  
ployees hired after May 18, 1998, may either bump  
the most junior employee hired after May 18, 1998,  
in their job classification and progression line or  
rollback to lower positions within their progression  
line based on their Local 1600 Seniority. If they do  
not bump another employee, they will be assigned  
to an available Utility Worker position closest to  
their home based on Local 1600 Seniority. In all  
cases, the employee will assume the rate of pay  
for the classification selected. Such employees will  
be subject to furlough or temporary assignments  
to other classifications for up to twelve (12) pay  
periods per rolling year until they attain fifteen (15)  
years of Local 1600 Seniority. .  
3. Employees on furlough will continue to accrue  
Company Service, Local 1600 Seniority, and  
receive full benefits, excluding coverage for any  
injury while working for another employer.  
4. If employees are on furlough or rolled-back in  
this process, contractors cannot be utilized in such  
employees’ quadrant, region, or roster location to  
perform unscheduled, critical work the Company  
employees would have normally performed for  
more than five (5) days during any furlough  
period. If contractors are used and employees  
are not offered the opportunity to return, such  
employees will be paid at the rate of pay for their  
regular classification for all days that contractors  
work in their quadrant, region, or roster location.  
B. Utility Worker Pool  
The parties agree to establish a pool of temporary em-  
ployees, Utility Worker, to replace contractors performing  
Building Custodian, Handyman-Power Production, Handy-  
€  
119  
Article XIl — Sec. 3  
man-Distribution, Groundman, and Laborer functions. This  
poo! will also provide opportunities for employees cov-  
ered under Article XII when their workload declines and it  
is necessary to temporarily reduce the work force. This  
provision will replace the use of Specific Temporaries in  
Article XIl.  
New employees will be hired to work as Utility Workers.  
Their Local 1600 Seniority will be the date of hire regard-  
less of the number of layoffs and such employees are eli-  
gible to bid on posted jobs while actively employed. In the  
event a period of layoff exceeds thirteen (13) pay periods a  
new Local 1600 Seniority date will be established. They are  
not eligible for benefits and travel expenses nor guaranteed  
forty (40) hours per week. Utility Workers will receive the  
same employee benefits and entitlements as defined in  
Article V, Section 4, Paragraph A as Specific Temporary  
employees. an employee is bumped by an Article XiIl  
employee, they can bump other Utility Workers with less  
Local 1600 Seniority.  
The intent of this concept is to replace the contractors  
doing this work with Local 1600 employees. However, to  
meet temporary peaks for flaggers at a particular location,  
contractors may occasionally do this work.  
When regular Article XII employees are assigned to this  
pool, they will be given the Utility Worker position closest to  
their home by Local 1600 Seniority and will continue to re-  
ceive benefits and travel expenses in accordance with the  
Labor Agreement.  
Utility Workers on layoff will have reemployment oppor-  
tunities before a new employee is hired into the Utility Worker  
Pool.  
C. Temporary Promotions  
Employees will be temporarily promoted to meet Field  
Services - Generation welding needs.  
120  
Articla XII — Sec. 3-4  
D. Temporary Promotion to Supervisor  
Non-supervisory employees may be temporarily pro-  
moted to supervisory positions in accordance with Article V,  
Section 2, Paragraph C(1) a, b.  
Section 4. Genera!  
A. Jobs Postponed or Canceled  
Whenever crews report for regular work and the job is  
canceled or postponed, they will be given First Aid, Safety,  
or other instructions or other work, and will be allowed, pro-  
vided they accept miscellaneous assignments, a minimum  
pay for that day equal to the pay for eight (8) hours at straight  
time rates.  
Whenever crews report for prearranged overtime work  
and the job is canceled or postponed they will be given First  
Aid, Safety, or other instructions or other work, and will be  
allowed, provided they accept miscellaneous assignments,  
a minimum pay for that day equal to the pay for four (4)  
hours at straight time rates. If the employee accepts the  
cancellation of prearranged overtime and elects not to re-  
port to work, the minimum compensation shail not apply.  
Employees who report for work and are not offered any other  
assignments will be eligible for the minimum compensation.  
B. Travel Time  
Travel time both ways between work headquarters and  
the job will be considered time worked.  
C. Short Shifting  
Employees who have their work schedule changed, per  
the Labor Agreement, will have at Jeast eight (8) hours of  
rest at home. They will be released from their regular as-  
signment at the time they are notified. Employees who have  
their work location changed will have at least eight (8) hours  
of rest at home before reporting to the new location.  
121  
Article XIl — Sec. 4  
D. Safety  
The parties agree all employees need to be committed  
to maintain an accident-free environment. No employee  
will be expected to perform work assignments for which  
they have not been trained or have an equivalent level of  
practical experience.  
When PPL employees perform work for others, they will  
follow PPL Safety Rules. In these situations, PPL Energy  
Control Process procedures will be followed as closely as  
possible.  
The President of Loca! 1600 shall select the bargaining  
unit members of joint Safety and Health Committees.  
When a lineman is working in the danger zone, a second  
lineman will be at that location.  
E. Training  
Formal training will be provided to employees at each  
level of the progression lines. Employees will begin training  
on the appropriate modules when they promote/select the  
new position. Employees must pass associated module  
testing in their current position prior to being considered for  
future promotions. Failure of training modules is not cause  
for an employee to be removed from their current position  
and employees who fail may re-test. Training will be com-
