### Wage Rate and Benefits  
### 
Wage rates and fringe benefit contributions to be paid employees on projects covered by this  
Agreement are set forth in Schedule A, which are made a part of this Agreement.  
Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to provide any employee a higher rate of pay, a  
greater health or pension contribution, or any other more favorable benefit, term or condition of  
employment than that required by any other collective bargaining contract entered into by the Union  
with any other Contractor competitive with this Company for the same classification of employment  
for the same period of time. To the extent that any such other collective bargaining contract provides  
lower wages, health or contributions, or any other less favorable benefit term or condition of  
employment than those provided hereunder, the provisions shall automatically be extended to the  
Company. If the Union negotiates such a more favorable benefit, it shall provide the Company with a  
written copy of the agreement containing such more favorable benefit within seven (7) calendar days of  
executing such agreement.  
Premium pay practices found elsewhere in the industry shall not be paid on projects worked under this  
Agreement. These prohibited premium pay practices shall include but not be limited to show-up pay  
or reporting pay, stand-by pay, premiums based on height or type of work, premiums based on

not considered fringe benefits and need not be paid by the Employer. eon  
No language in the Agreement shall be construed as guaranteeing any number of hours of work per day  
or per week for any employee.  
The Union and the Company recognize the need to promote training, skiils enhancement, and safety  
activities that would improve job skills and enhance job security for employees as well as contribute to  
the competitiveness and wellbeing of the Company. Therefore both parties agree that the wages set  
forth in Schedule “A” of this agreement are based upon continuous craft training for all eligible  
employees covered by this agreement. Furthermore, such traiming shall be administered under the  
following guidelines:

working hours, and shall not be considered hours worked, and shall not be compensated by the  
Company.  
Z. It is agreed that the Union and the Company will conduct all training in a spirit of cooperation  
with the intent to produce safer, more efficient, and conscientious employees. Therefore, the  
Company shall be ultimately responsible for the assessment of employees’ training needs; to  
determine course selection, and to assist in the location and scheduling of all training classes.  
Furthermore, the company may make such training a condition for continued employment  
provided that adequate time is afforded to the employee to receive said training.  
3. The Union and the Joint Apprenticeship Committee shall be ultimately responsible for the  
training process, course content and delivery, instructor certifications, and expenses associated  
with the training of eligible employees.  
4, It is understood that sufficient time will be allotted to adequately cover the selected subject  
matter, and that each course may range from at least eight (8) hours to no more than forty (40)  
hours. Any employee that has not received eight (8) hours of craft training prior to July 1, 2004  
may, at the Company’s discretion, be required to receive an additional eight hours of craft  
training in order to receive this contract’s guaranteed wage.

### Owner Relations

The parties to this Agreement have a deep appreciation for the Owner and a respect for all the  
prerogatives and privileges of the Owner. It is the Owner who provides the work and the employment  
opportunities and it is the PLEDGE of the parties to satisfy the Owner’s requirements and to develop a  
“repeat business” relationship.  
The parties recognize that many Owners have constructed facilities in Georgia to improve their  
employee’s relations and to avail themselves of the abundant labor supply in the state. The trades want to  
continue to perform construction and maintenance for the Owners and PLEDGE that they will not  
participate in any organizational effort toward an Owner whose facility is constructed or maintained under  
this Agreement, nor support such an effort by others.  
1. Employees covered by this Agreement will keep out of areas of the project which have been  
accepted by the Owner for beneficial occupancy and designated as such. Exceptions will be made  
for employees who have been directed by the Employer to enter such areas to perform specific  
work assignments.  
2. Union representatives and employees covered by the Agreement will not contact employees of the  
Owner during work hours for non-job-rejated purposes.  
3. . This Agreement will have no relationship or effect upon the operation, production, or  
maintenance work within a facility being performed by the Owner, its employees or other  
employers reporting directly to the Owner. As areas of the construction project are accepted by  
the Owner for beneficial occupancy, there will be no further interest in such occupied areas except  
where the Employer must return to accomplish repairs, modifications, check out or warranty  
functions required by the contract with the Owner.  
The Owner may perform any part of the construction work, or any work or service related thereto, with  
their own employees as they deem best, or to contract all or any part of such work or services, including  
the maintenance of machinery or equipment, or the calibration, testing, checking and start-up of  
equipment, systems or partial systems, areas, or pieces of equipment turned over to the Owner.  
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Employer from using any materials, supplies or  
equipment regardless of source or whether fabricated or assembled off the job site. The Employer’s  
purchase order or contract for purchase of equipment shall be considered the Owner’s instructions for the  
purchase ofa specific item. There shall be no controversy over installation of such materials, supplies or  
equipment.  

### ARTICLE X

Intent of the Parties  
It is intended that this Agreement shall not violate any applicable federal or state law, but if any condition  
is held to violate any law, that portion of the Agreement shall be considered null and void; but the  
remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

with Disabilities Act”. Such action shall not be a violation of this Agreement, nor shall it be a subject of
