employees in the Network Television or Local Television  
Seniority Group, whichever is applicable, after first laying off  
all employees m the applicable group, the excess shall be laid  
off in inverse order of seniority from the employees in the

next occur in inverse order of Unit Seniority from among  
those empioyees previously in the Master Television Seniority  
Group employed, by either network television or local

overall performance is satisfactory, an employee shall no longer be  
subject to that particular notice of discharge.  
If, after the employee’s having been given this opportunity to establish  
and maintain a satisfactory level] of performance, the Company  
determines that a discharge under this Section 14,1(b) is appropriate,

discharges under 14. f(a). Should the Union determine to arbitrate the  
discharge, the procedures to be followed are provided for in Section

either party in any other discipline arbitration.  
(c) [fat any time the Company determines that the particular nature of the  
“unsatisfactory performance” by itself or in combination with other conduct  
warrants proceeding instead under the “just cause” provisions of Section 14.1(a),  
it may elect to do so.  
(d) The Company shall have no obligation to transfer, reassign or train any employee  
to perform any other bargaining unit job function prior to a discharge for just

(5)  
All time spent in service is counted in accruing seniority for all  
purposes under the NABET agreements including the requisite periods  
of more than five (5) years for the extra vacation.  
Those returning after the vacation season will receive no vacation until  
the following year.  
If the number of months the employee worked in the year in which he  
or she went into the service, added to the number of months he or she  
worked in the year in which the employee returned from service, is  
twelve (12) months or less, he or she shal! receive one (1) full vacation  
period or vacation pay, for both years combined.  
Subject 10 Paragraph (3), if ihe sum exceeds twelve (12) months, the  
total vacation for the combined years shall be prorated, a fractional day  
counting as a full day. For example, if the sum ts eighteen (18) months,  
the employee shall receive a total of one and one-half (1-1/2) vacations  
for both years and if, for example, the employee received in time or  
money a full vacation on leaving, the employee would be entitled to  
one-half (1/2) of a full vacation for the year in which he or she returns.  
When an employee who has been on an unpaid leave of absence for a total of  
more than sixty (60) working days in any calendar year pursuant to any Section  
of Article XIH returns to active employment during the course of that year, he or  
she shaif receive a pro-rated vacation in the subsequent year, The number of  
weeks (or days} of such vacation shal] be based on a fraction, the numerator of  
which shall be the total number of workweeks worked by the employee in the  
year he or she returns from the leave of absence and the denominator of which  
shall be fifty-two (52), multiplied by the applicable number of weeks set forth in  
Section 19,1, The employee will be entitled to time off without pay for the  
unpaid portion of his or her vacation.  
Where an employee is entitled under the terms of this Agreement to vacation or  
holiday pay on termination of employment, such payment shall be made to his or her  
estate in the case of the employee’s death.

Section 19.16  
At the Company’s television stations in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and  
Los Angeles, and at its Washington office, an employee eligible for vacation may  
schedule one week of his or her vacation entitlement in single days, in accordance with  
the following:  
(a) The employee must elect this option on hts or her first pick;  
{b) Single days in any particular vacation selection Group will not be  
permitted if vacation selections for such Group are already at  
maximum level;  
{c) Requests for scheduling single vacation days must be made in writing  
to the appropriate Company scheduling office and the Local Commitiee  
for the station in which the employee is assigned no less than ten (10)  
days prior to the posting of the schedule on which the requested day off

of the given year or those remaining days may be scheduled by the  
Station;  
(f} Single vacation days cannot be transferred to any subsequent year, and,  
(g} Under no circumstanccs will single vacation days be paid for rather  
than taken as time off.

alternate on existing Safety Committees where established and to the creation of Safety  
Committees with a NABET-CWA-representative and alternate to be appointed thereto at  
cach office of the Company where no Safety Committee currently exists. Meetings will  
be held every other month at each office, unless the exigencies of the situation require a  
meeting of the Safety Committee to take place at other times.  
Section 21.2  
In the event the Union wishes to retain safety consultants to advise it on matters  
of occupational health and safety, the Company agrees to designate a representative to  
meet with such consultants at times and places mutually agreed upon by the Company  
gnd the Union. Such consultants may also, at the Union's request and upon reasonable  
prior notice to the Company, attend meetings of the Safety Committees provided for in  
Section 21.1 above.  
Section 21.3  
During the course of their 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the matter of  
the safety of employees assigned to ENG pickups in the field. The parties fully  
recognize that news gathering assignments in the field by their very nature have  
historically presented safety issues not normally present in other aspects of the  
broadcasting industry. In the course of these discussions, the parties recognized that the  
safety of ENG personnel assigned to these pickups has been and continues to be a matter  
of prime importance.  
The parties acknowledge that an ENG field assignment is “hazardous” only if its  
performance (or continued performance) necessarily entails an immediate and significant  
risk of a serious physical! injury to the employee(s) assigned. Moreover, it is expressly  
understood and agreed that while the right of assignment belongs exclusively with the  
Company, as in the past an employee(s) at the pickup location of a news story who has  
assessed the particular situation need not commence a hazardous assignment or, if the  
assignment has already begun but has become hazardous, may withdraw to a position of  
safety at or near the site of the pickup. In either case, such employee shall use his or her  
best efforts to fulfill the assignment.  
65  
   
Section 21.3 Cont'd  
As the parties have recognized in the past, any decision not to begin or continue  
to perform a hazardous assignment must be made in good faith, be reasonable under al!  
of the circumstances, and whenever possible with prior consultation with an appropriate  
assignment editor or management personnel, If, under the circumstances, such pnor  
consultation is not possible, the decision not to begin or continue to perform a hazardous  
assignment must be communicated as soon as possible to the assignment  
editor or management personne}. In the event of any conflict between an employee’s  
decision and an order to perform given by an assignment editor or a manager, the  
employee(s) shall not be regarded as insubordinate provided that his or her decision is in  
accordance with the foregoing provisions. °  
In view of this, the panies are in agreement that at each Company operating unit  
where ENG personnel are employed, a special committee, consisting of representative  
employees from the ENG unit and local management whose presence may be conducive  
to a discussion of safety shali periodically mect as mutually agreed upon to discuss  
issues of safety relating ta ENG field assignments. At each Company television station  
these meetings shall be attended by the News Director and other senior station officials.  
At each network ENG location the Network News Bureau Chief and a senior BO&E  
official, along with other appropriate management officials will attend such meeting(s).  
An agreed upon number of ENG ficld personnel shail attend such meetings as  
operational requirements permit in order to provide information or make suggestions on  
the basis of their own news gathering experience, These meetings shall be held no less  
than once every six (6} months.

Tun concurrently with any paid short term disability leave to which an  
employee is entitled under Section (c} 2., but only for the first five (5)  
consecutive days an employce is out of work. After the fifth (Sth)  
consecutive day of sick leave, any subsequent consecutive days will be  
counted only as Short Term Disability, For example, if an employee  
who is eligible for ten (10) paid sick days under Section (c) 1. is absent  
due to illness for seven {7) consecutive work days, the first five (5)  
consecutive days of that leave would count concurrently as paid sick  
leave under Section (¢) 1. and as Short Term Disability leave under  
Section (c} 2., but the last two (2) consecutive days would count only  
as Short Term Disability Leave under Section (c) 2. This employee  
would then be eligible for five (5) days of paid sick days remaining  
for use in that calendar year.  
If, after an employee exhausts his or her maximum sick leave with pay as outlined in  
(b), above, [or for employees in the Los Angeles and San Francisco offices of the  
Company, short term disability leave as provided in (c) 2.], the disability  
continues, he or she will be eligible to receive for any further period of disability, but  
not continuing past six {6) months from the start of the disability, payments at fifty  
percent (50%) of the employee’s salary rate less any amount payable under any state  
disability benefit program for the applicable period.

and then returns to work, the employee may again be eligible for compensation  
under Paragraph (d) if he or she is disabled for a penod of five (5) work days;  
provided, however, that if such subsequent absence is relatcd to the prior  
disability, the employee must have returned to work for a period of six (6) months  
before he or she is again eligible for compensation under Paragraph (d).

herein will be deemed to require inputs at such source to be entered by  
employees covered by this Agreement. In addition, any information  
which has been collected, input or processed in the memory of any  
computer by any person not covered by the Master Agreement may be  
transferred, directly or indirectly, to any technical equipment.  
If there are any instances in which the foregoing paragraph or the last  
paragraph of this Section A2.2(b) creates a severe operational problem  
for the Company resulting in unanticipated hardships, the matter will  
be discussed with the Union and, if no satisfactory arrangement is  
made, the method of handling the matter will be subject to arbitration.  
The Company wilt provide opportunities for employees to improve  
their skills in the use of such devices in connection with the production  
of program material. This will include but will not be limited to on-  
the-job training and outside sources of instruction.  
The provisions of this Section A2.2(b) shall be applicable to the  
operation of keyboard or other input devices when such devices are  
used to feed information into, or extract information from, a memory  
or storage device not covered by the first sentence of this Section

When the Company intends to cover a news story with  
electronic cameras capable of being hand-held, it may pool  
whatever lighting work is necessary for such coverage with  
any news and other information gathering compan(ies) or  
organization(s), The companies will rotate such pool lighting  
assignments on a basis that will] assure that ABC’s  
engineering employees will handle a fair proportion of the  
work involved in such assignments. When ABC is to supply  
the lighting under such arrangement, NABET-CWA-  
represented engineering employees will be assigned to  
perform such work.  
Similarly, when two (2) or three (3) of the four (4) companies  
intend to cover a news story and the third (3rd) or fourth  
(4th) such company 1s either not covering that news story at  
all, or is covering it with a film crew, the other two (2) or  
three (3) companies may pool whatever lighting work is  
necessary for such coverage. The companies participating in  
such pool lighting assignments wilt rotate the assignments on  
a basis that will assure that ABC engineering employees will  
handle a fair proportion of the work involved in such  
assignments. When ABC is to supply the lighting under such  
arrangement, NABET-C WA-represented engineering  
employees will be assigned to perform such work.  
The engineering employees of the company performing the  
pooled lighting assignment hereunder shall, upon request,  
perform for any of the other companies such additional or  
modified lighting work (including relocating and refocusing  
of lights) as may be required by them for their special use  
(e.g., a “standupper” that takes place before, during or after  
the companies’ general coverage of the story itself) but may  
perform such additional or modified lighting for such other  
companies only if such additional or modified lighting takes  
place in the same general area as the pooled lighting itself.  
Where the pooled lighting itself ts in a room, the term  
“general area” shall include the same room or an immediately  
adjacent area.

In situations when it is ABC's turn to provide pool lighting, if  
the Company should assign an engineer(s) specifically to the  
remote location in advance of the arrival of its crew in order  
10 be responsible for the necessary pool lighting work, the  
classification of one (1) such engineer shall be a Group 7.  
Except as provided for in the preceding sentence, the parties  
recognize that lighting for the poo) can be assigned to the  
engineering employees assigned to the crew in accordance  
with this Section A2.2(e).  
In addition to the foregoing, if two (2) or more of the  
companies are covering a Presidential trip with equipment of  
the type covered by this Section A2.2(¢), within the  
Continental United States (but outside Washington, D.C., or  
its immediate vicinity), sach companies may similarly pool  
whatever lighting work is necessary. The companies will  
rotate these Presidential trip assignments where lighting is  
pooled on a basis that will assure that ABC's engineering  
employees will handle a fair proportion of such overall  
Presidential trips. The company which has the pool  
responsibility under the terms of this Subparagraph will  
assign an additional engineering employee to the crew(s) to  
perform whatever pool or unilateral lighting work may be  
required by the pool participants as well as other work that  
may be required to assist the other crew members, such as  
moving or transporting equipment. It is understood that on  
Presidential trips, some lighting functions may be performed  
by non-Company personnel in connection with “lighting the  
President’, as heretofore.  
The foregoing Subparagraphs are only applicable to pickups  
of the type described in Subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (v) where  
camera coverage is handled on a unilateral basis by each  
company and it is therefore understood that technica] work  
unretated to lighting will not be affected by this Agreement.  
A record will be kept by the Company of pool assignments  
made hereunder and will show which companies’ employees  
were assigned to do the lighting work. The purpose is to  
assure an equitable distribution of the work performed  
hereunder. Such record shall be available to the Union.

Section A2.2¢¢)4 (vill)  
This Paragraph 4 is limited to the situations described above.  
It is not intended to imply either the same or a different  
treatment in other situations. [t wil] not be precedent for any  
assignments of work on any pickups except those specified  
herein, and neither this Paragraph 4 nor any practice under it  
on any pickup covered by it, nor any practice preceding this  
Paragraph 4 if it had been in effect on that date, will be cited  
in any case covering a different type of pickup. Specifically,  
not fo be cited in any such case, is the use of the lighting  
“pool” arrangement hereunder for pooling only part of the  
technical work involved in a particular pickup.  
It is the intent of the foregoing provisions of this Section  
A2.2(e)4 that when two (2) or more of the four (4) companies  
are covering a news pickup with equipment of the type  
described herein, the lighting wil] be performed by the  
engineering employees of one (1} of such companies.  
However, it is recognized that situations may develop when  
organizations other than ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are  
already present at the site of the pickup which may make it  
impracticable for any of the companies to set up lights  
although their gear and engineering personnel are available at  
the site. If such situations are not kept to a minimum, ABC  
and NABET-CWA will consult with each other in order to  
develop procedures, together with other companies and  
unions, if possible, to solve such problems  
On news pickups in the ficld, not covered by (i) through (ix)  
above, engineering employees assigned to the event in  
accordance with this Section A2.2(e) shall perform any  
lighting functions that are performed unless the lighting is to  
be performed in a location where another union has  
contracted “house jurisdictian” over lighting functions which  
does noi exclude electranic news pickups, Further, when  
lights have already been set up by other film or tape crews at  
a place where the news story is to be cavered, the pickup may  
be made without employees hereunder setting up lights if  
such other lights are sufficient for the pickup. {lt is the intent  
of the Company that the engineering crew and their gear will  
normally be assigned to the site in such a manner that they  
will have time and equipment to do the lighting just as  
though no one else had done it.)

following manner:  
I. In the event an employee is laid off and has accepted severance pay,  
and is subsequently recalled, the employee will retain the full amount  
of his or her severance pay upon recall and any severance pay to which  
the employee may be entitled thereafter shall accrue only from the date  
of his or her last recall, plus any portion of a year for which no  
severance pay has previously been received.  
2. If an employee declines downgrading to a lower pay classification, the  
employee will be required to acknowledge such action in writing at the  
time of layoff and his or her acceptance of severance pay will preclude  
the employee returning to the declined pay classification during a  
period equal to the number of weeks of paid severance.  
3, In the event that an employee accepts downgrading and a reduction in  
tate as an alternative to layoff, and is subsequently laid off before the  
employee has completed twelve (12) months in the lower classification,

Notwithstanding any provision of Section A2.2{d), persons not covered by the  
Engineering Agreement may feed information and/or instructions, the purpose of which  
is to control any operation to which a Technical Director would otherwise be assigned,  
into a computer as descnbed in Section A2.2(d) by using input devices located and  
operated either in technical or non-technical areas at any time prior to broadcast.  
If the Company elects to “break” such computer by placing the information or  
instructions to such computer on a magnetic tape, punch tape or similar device for  
insertion into the computer instead of feeding such information or instructions to such  
computer directly through a keyboard or similar input device, then the preceding  
paragraph shall not be applicable. In such case, however, Section A2.2(d)} will not  
prevent persons not covered by the Engineering Agreement from physically preparing the  
punch tape, magnetic tape or similar device for use by a Technical Director covered by  
this Agreement to feed information and instructions into the computer.  
Where a “back-up” tape is prepared for use in case the computer fails to operate  
properly on direct input, this shall not be deemed to be an election to break such  
computer, but if such back-up tape must be used to feed the instructions or information  
which runs the computer, a Technical Director covered by the Engineering Agreement  
will feed or insert such tape into the computer.  
When a process control computer is taken out of service for maintenance and is  
subsequently put back in service, the engineering employee who updates such computer  
shall be a Group 7 employee, or an employee temporarily upgraded to Group 7 on the  
day(s) such updating is performed.

notwithstanding Sections 3,6 and 3.7 of the Master  
Agreement, the employment and any extensions  
thereof of persons who are placed on the “vacation  
relief list” as vacation relief employees in  
succeeding calendar years shall not result in such  
employees’ achieving regular status under the  
Agreement;  
the entitlement of a person on the “vacation rehef  
list” to be recalled for vacation relief employment  
shall be terminated if such person (a) has not been
