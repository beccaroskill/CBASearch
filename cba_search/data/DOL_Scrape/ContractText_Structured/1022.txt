the Employer, shall immediately notify the Business Agent, who shall proceed at once to  
collect the amount due, including pay for waiting time, not exceeding one day, which shall

percent (1%) of the amount of contribution due, for each month or part thereof of  
delinquency beyond sixty (60) days.  
4. The Employer further agrees that if, as a result of an audit ordered by the Trustees of  
one of the Fringe Benefit Funds, he is found to have been substantially inaccurate in  
reporting, or late in remitting contributions due, he may be charged the costs of making  
such audit, in the discretion of the Trustees involved.  
5. (a) In the event any Employer is delinquent for more than forty-five (45) days in the  
payment of contributions to the fringe benefit funds provided in this Agreement, the  
Employer shall, at the end of each pay period, and not later than 4:30 p.m. on Friday of the  
pay week, make payment by cashier's or certified check to the Local Union of a sum equal  
to the fringe benefits owing for that pay period accompanied by reporting forms as required

gan Laborers’ Fringe Benefit Funds.  
(b) After a delinquency has been corrected and the Employer has made timely weekly  
payments for one (1) month, the Employer may resume fringe benefit payments on a  
monthly basis.

12

no slowdown, no stoppage of work, no strike (unless Article XII, Section 4, is applicable)  
and no lock-out over the terms and conditions of this Agreement, it being the good faith  
intention of the parties hereto that by the execution of this Agreement industrial peace shall  
16  
be brought about and maintained, that the parties shall cooperate to the end that the work  
may be done efficiently and without interruption. In the case of any violation of this  
Agreement, the Employer and the Union shall be notified immediately.

interpretation of this Agreement or the operation of either party hereunder cannot be  
adjusted between Employer and Union, then the Labor Director of the Associated General

opinion or dispute, and he shall take such steps as he deems necessary to attempt to  
adjust such difference of opinion or dispute. If no adjustment or settlement can be resolved,  
then the Secretary shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, call a meeting between the Labor  
Committee of the Associated General Contractors of America, Greater Detroit Chapter,  
Inc., and the party or parties involved in the dispute, at which time an attempt shall be

the Employer and one by the Union. These two Arbitration Board Members shall have  
authority to choose a third member. If no third member can be agreed upon within  
forty-eight (48) hours, then application shall be made to the State of Michigan Conciliation  
Service for appointment of a third member. A decision of the majority of the Arbitration  
Board shall be binding upon both parties, and both parties agree to abide thereby to carry  
out the decision. Pending settlement of any such dispute, however, it is agreed that the  
work shall be processed without slowdown, work stoppage or lockout.

work, any and all Fringe Benefit Payments, as provided in this Agreement, shall not be  
considered as subject to arbitration, provided the Union gives twenty-four (24) hours written  
or telegraphic notice to the Association and the Employer concerned, prior to taking  
economic action (including strike) for violation of payment, as provided in this Agreement.  
The Arbitration Board shall have no power to modify, change or amend or abrogate this  
Agreement in any way.  
5. The above procedure applies to Employer members of the Associated General  
Contractors of America, Greater Detroit Chapter, Inc. However, the Secretary and Labor  
Committee of the Association are not precluded from taking whatever action is deemed  
necessary and appropriate with respect to the adjustment of disputes between the Union  
and other Employers.  
6. In the event Employer fails or refuses to comply with the grievance procedure set out in  
Section 3 hereinabove, the provisions of Article XII, Section 1, shall not be binding upon the  
Union. If the Union fails or refuses to comply with the grievance procedure set out in Article  
XIl, Section 1 hereinabove, then Employer shail have the right to declare this entire  
Agreement null and void.  
17  
7. It is further agreed that there shall be no stoppage of work due to jurisdictional  
controversy between the trades and that said jurisdictional controversy arising shall be

Board.  
8. Members not submitting claims for proper wages or overtime due within thirty (30) days
