Notwithstanding any other provision in Article XI to the con-  \ntrary, the Trustees of the fringe benefit funds may require any  \nEmployer who has been frequently delinquent in making such  \nconinbutions, as certified by the Administrator of any fringe  \nbenefit fund, or whose current payroll exceeds his classification,  \nto comply with the provisions of Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this  \nArticle XI.  \n13.

The  \nobligation to make the $.10 contribution will cease when  \nthe toial amount deposited by such Employer equals  \n$25,000 in excess of any indebtedness to the fringe benefit  \nfunds.  \n(c) A New Employer is defined as an Employer who has been  \nmaking fringe benefit contributions to the Funds for less than two  \n(2) years.

A Bridge Job is construction-related work  \nwhich may or may not be within the work jurisdiction of the  \nUnion. The scale of wages will be determined by the administrat-  \ning physician's classification of the tasks to be performed com-  \nmensurate with the capability of the carpenter. The work classifica-  \ntions are:  \nVery Light Work: Lifting ten pounds maximum and occa-  \nsionally lifting and/or carrying such articles as dockets, ledgers  \nand small tools. Although a very light job is defined as one  \nwhich involves sitting, walking and/or standing may often be  \nnecessary in carrying out job duties. The amount of walking  \nand/or standing permissible will be determined by the extent  \nto which the injured body part impairs the ability to walk  \nand/or stand.  \nLight Work: Lifting twenty pounds maximum with frequent  \nlifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds.  \nEven though the weight lifted may be only a negligible  \namount, a job is in this category when it requires walking or  \nstanding to a significant degree or when it involves sitting with  \na moderate degree of pushing and pulling of arm and/or leg  \ncontrols.  \nMedium Work: Lifting fifty pounds maximum with frequent  \nlifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to twenty-five  \npounds.  \nThe Base Wage for Very Light Work will be 30% of the Joumey-  \nman Base Wage. The Base Wage for Light Work will be 50% of  \nthe Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage for Medium Work  \nwill be 75% of the Joumeyman Base Wage. For all work classifi-  \ncations, the Employer will pay the full dollar amount of fringe  \nbenefits received by a Carpenter Journeyman in addition to the  \napplicable Base Wage. Compensation would increase as the  \ncarpenter progresses through the work classifications based on the  \nphysician's approval of the next level of physical demand.  \nThe Workers' Compensation insurance provider may pay an  \nadditional weekly amount to the employee as an added incentive  \nto encourage his voluntary participation in the Back-to-Work  \nProgram. This amount, if any, will be determined based on the  \nformula as provided for by the workers\u2019 compensation guidelines.  \nRefusal of a reasonable offer of employment may jeopardize the  \ncontinued collection of benefits in accordance with State law.  \n37  \nA carpenter's employment under the Back-to-Work Program is  \nlimited to a maximum of six months for each incident. Implemen-  \ntation of the Program is discretionary on behalf of the Employer,  \nand is subject to the availability of Bridge Jobs. Upon release for  \nwork by the administrating physician, the carpenter would return  \nto full wages and be placed in available work.  \nTHE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF AMERI-  \nCA, GREATER DETROIT CHAPTER, INC.  \nForrest A.
