In the event of significant  \nchanges in performance, changes in content of the employee\u2019s work, or in the event of promotion, reduction  \nin force, or other reason, an additional evaluation may be performed. Any significant improvement or  \ndecline in an MTS\u2019s performance ratings in comparison with previous years must be explained in Part II B  \nof the Performance Evaluation Form, which contains the supervisor\u2019s comments. This explanation should  \nspecifically identify, where appropriate, any apparent decline or increase in an MTS\u2019s rating because of a  \nchange in the manner or method of evaluation.  \n606 The performance documentation shall include an evaluation of the bargaining unit member,  \nusing a list of performance factors and appropriate performance indicators. Where factors other than those  \nlisted on the review form are also relevant because of the nature of the job, such other factors may also be  \nutilized by supervision. Where factors other than the established factors set forth in the Performance  \n11  \nEvaluation Form are determined by management to be relevant in evaluating an MTS\u2019s performance in a  \nparticular position, those factors should be identified and discussed with the MTS sufficiently in advance to  \nfairly advise the employee and subsequently be identified on the form itself.  \n607 Each employee will be informed of his or her evaluation in the course of a personal  \ndiscussion with supervision. The employee will have the opportunity to comment on the evaluation verbally  \nand in writing. Any written comments will become part of the evaluation record and a copy of the  \nevaluation will be given to the employee.  \n608 Each employee in an organization is ranked according to value. If desired, the employee  \nmay verbally request to receive in writing marked as \u201cHigh Sensitivity\u201d and \u201cAerospace Internal Use Only\u201d  \nhis/her value ranking and a brief narrative describing its basis. Employee value rankings are reported to the  \nindividual employee in one (1) of five (5) groups (also known as \"bins\"), of approximately 1-10, 11-30, 31-  \n70, 71-90, and 91-100 percent. In small organizations such as those with less than 10 employees, fewer  \ngroups may be utilized in reporting value rankings. Specifically, an employee may request to be informed  \nwhere he/she is in the bottom group.  \n609 Where an employee\u2019s performance is established as unsatisfactory or has significantly  \ndeclined, that fact shall be stated on the evaluation form and the employee given the opportunity to discuss  \nwith supervision the reasons for that judgment and the areas where improvement is required.  \n610 The performance management process for the MTS is described in Appendix C, Work  \nEnvironment, Section 1, Performance Management Process.  \n611 Transfers  \n612 ~All open job positions within the bargaining unit shall be posted or communicated to all  \nCorporate locations unless a specific determination is made to the contrary by the cognizant Level 6 Vice  \nPresident.  \n613 The Corporation shall provide APSA with a monthly report (Report 021-116, SAP-  \nZHRRAPSO, APSA Report on the Exempt Active Population) in paper copy only indicating employees who  \nhave transferred into and out of the bargaining unit. This report includes bargaining unit employees who  \nhave entered or terminated employment from, changed status, or transferred within the Corporation. This  \nreport shall include the following information for each bargaining unit member: employee badge number,  \nemployee name, four-digit cost center code, pay plan, organization level and status.  \n614 \u2014 All applications for posted positions shall be written and full consideration shall be given to  \nall such applications. A member of the bargaining unit may apply for any open position without prejudice to  \nhis or her current position. In administering the provisions of this paragraph, the Corporation will send a  \nletter to job applicants with the following text:  \n\u201cYour request for transfer for the above noted personnel requisition has been received and referred  \nto the appropriate supervisor.\u201d  \n\u201cTt is the practice of the Human Resources Division not to notify the Supervisor of an employee  \nwho is seeking a transfer. It is felt that such notice by an employee to her or his Supervisor is good  \nbusiness practice but it is not required.\u201d  \n12  \n615 Transfers will be made at the discretion of the Corporation based upon management\u2019s  \nassessment of the operational requirements and of the applying employee\u2019s suitability. Unsuccessful  \napplicants for posted jobs shall, upon rejection, be informed in writing of the reasons therefore.  \n616 No bargaining unit employee shall, except under unusual circumstances, be involuntarily  \nreclassified to a position at a lower level as a result of reorganization or otherwise without having been  \ngiven at least forty-five (45) calendar days to seek another position with the Corporation.  \n617 The corporation\u2019s policy is not to transfer an employee into an organization where the  \nemployee would be reporting to the same manager/supervisor as a family member or domestic partner.  \nFamily members and domestic partners may not be in a supervisory relationship.  \n618 The limit of 6 pending transfers can be waived on a case-by-case basis by the Human  \nResources Department.  \n619 The limit of 6 pending transfers is waived for those in displaced status or those notified  \nthey have been selected for a reduction in force.  \n620 Reduction in Force (RIF)  \n621 Whenever it becomes necessary to reduce or change the composition of the working force  \nbecause of lack of work, the imposition of budgetary changes, a reorganization of tasks, changing  \nrequirements for particular skills or occupations or other reasons, management may select employees for  \nreduction in force. Ability to perform the remaining work, performance as an Aerospace employee, and, to  \nthe extent it bears upon the foregoing, experience gained in years of service at Aerospace and elsewhere  \nshall be considered by Management in selecting employees for RIF. All members of the bargaining unit  \nshall be evaluated on a non-discriminatory basis. It is the intent of the Corporation to select employees for  \nRIF from as broad a base as is suitable under the circumstances; however, the provisions of this Article do  \nnot require that all reductions are Corporate-wide in scope nor restrict the Corporation\u2019s right to transfer  \nemployees or to offer transfers and/or reclassifications to employees affected by reduction in force. In cases  \nof RIF, the Corporation agrees to expedite its review of applications for transfer in those situations where  \nthe Corporation believes transfers may be warranted.  \n622 Employees who are eligible to enter retirement from active employment and who have been  \nselected for termination of employment as part of a RIF shall not be required to forego severance pay as a  \ncondition to invoking retirement status.  \n623 In the event of a RIF, access of RIF\u2019d ees to Aerospace facilities shall not be limited  \nbeyond normal controls for regular employees between 7:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday  \n(except holidays). Exceptions may be made where program security or individual circumstances warrant.  \n624 Rehire  \n625 The Corporation shall establish a roster consisting of the names of those employees whose  \nemployment has been terminated under the provisions of Paragraph 621 of this Agreement. At the  \ntermination interview, employees shall be informed of the Corporation\u2019s rehire policy as specified in  \nParagraph 650 of this Agreement. At this time, the Corporation shall ask employees if they wish to have  \ntheir name on the roster. Only employees, who respond \u201cYes\u201d, will have their names included on the roster.  \nThe Corporation shall request resumes from all employees who have responded \u201cYes.\u201d The collected  \nresumes shall be included with the roster. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to provide the  \nCorporation with a resume. For a period of one (1) year following termination of employment, the  \n13  \nCorporation shall send copies of the current MTS position vacancies to each person on said roster. The  \nmailings shall be concurrent with distribution within the Corporation of each publication of these postings.  \nThe Corporation shall implement procedures to ensure that persons on said roster who notify the  \nCorporation in writing of their interest and suitability shall be considered along with other applicants for  \nany position to be filled by the Corporation by outside hiring. No outside applicant shall be hired for a  \nposition as to which there is a person on said roster who has notified the Corporation of his or her interest  \nand suitability unless a written explanation has been approved by the level 4 manager. It shall be the  \nresponsibility of persons on said roster to keep the Corporation informed of his or her address. Persons shall  \nremain on said roster for a period of one (1) year, or until such person is rehired, declines an offer of rehire,  \nor asks to have his or her name removed from the roster.  \n626 Notification in the Event of a Reduction in Force  \n627 To the Individual  \n628 An employee designated to be terminated through RIF shall be given written notice in  \naccordance with Paragraph 633.  \n629 ToAPSA  \n630 The Corporation agrees, to the extent practicable, to notify APSA in writing at least three  \n(3) weeks prior to the notification of any individual of their inclusion in a RIF when the RIF 1s anticipated  \nto involve five (5) or more members of the bargaining unit. There shall be no obligation to give APSA  \nadvance notice of the names of the individuals whose inclusion in the RIF is anticipated or to discuss with  \nAPSA the names of the individuals under review for possible inclusion in the RIF. In any RIF, APSA shall  \nbe notified in writing of the name of each member of the bargaining unit to be included in the RIF concur-  \nrently with such notice to the individual. A letter of notification shall inform the individual that he/she may  \nhave an APSA representative present at the notification interview. Any individual to be included in the RIF  \nmay request the presence of an APSA representative at the notification interview.  \n631 APSA agrees that the information, which it receives from the Corporation in advance of  \nany anticipated RIF, shall be treated by it as confidential.  \n632 Options in Event of RIF  \n633 Any member of the bargaining unit whose employment is being terminated due to a RIF  \nshall receive four (4) week\u2019s written notice of his or her termination of employment. Any bargaining unit  \nmember designated for RIF shall have the option of receiving up to four (4) weeks\u2019 pay in lieu of notice.  \nBargaining unit members shall receive at least one (1) week\u2019s written notice plus three (3) weeks\u2019 pay or a  \ncombination of written notice and pay in lieu of notice equaling four (4) weeks\u2019 salary. If, in the opinion of  \nthe cognizant Level 6 Vice President, operational factors should require immediate termination the  \nbargaining unit member shall receive four (4) weeks\u2019 pay in lieu of notice.  \n634 The Corporation shall provide for bargaining unit members who have been designated for  \nRIF and who are otherwise eligible for retirement to be able to enter retirement from active employment.  \n635 Corrective Action Process  \n636 The Corporation has a corrective action process for managing unsatisfactory performance  \nand/or unacceptable conduct by bargaining unit members. If requested by the member, an APSA  \nrepresentative shall be allowed to be present to represent the bargaining unit member in any Step 2 or 3  \n14  \ncorrective action meeting. With or without the participation of APSA, a bargaining unit member shall be  \nprovided an opportunity to respond to the identified problem(s) in any corrective action meeting. A  \ndescription of the corrective action process is provided in Appendix C, Work Environment, Section 2,  \nCorrective Action.  \n637 Termination for Cause  \n638 The Corporation has the right to terminate for cause. The Corporation shall notify APSA  \npromptly, but in any event within two (2) working days, of any termination for cause. Any employee in the  \nprocess of being terminated for cause may request the presence of an APSA representative at the  \ntermination interview.  \n639 Termination for cause shall include but not be limited to terminations for unsatisfactory  \nperformance. An employee terminated for \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d shall be given a prior written  \nCorrective Action concerning his performance and a reasonable time to correct the deficiency. All such  \nwritten Corrective Actions shall be reviewed by the Human Resources Division to consider whether  \nremedial action or a remedial program is appropriate and has been recommended.  \n640 Termination for cause shall also include a very limited category of discretionary  \nterminations upon the authority of the President or cognizant Senior Vice President of the Corporation. Any  \nsuch discretionary termination shall not be subject to grievance.  \n641 Displaced Status  \n642 Displaced status occurs when an employee\u2019s job has been eliminated as a result of  \nreorganization, has been filled during an employee\u2019s leave of absence or has become unsuitable as a result  \nof an employee\u2019s inability to perform the primary functions of the job. APSA shall be notified, in writing,  \nof the name of each member of the bargaining unit to be placed on displaced status concurrently with such  \nnotice to the individual.  \n643 The goal of placing employees in displaced status is to provide an opportunity for the  \nemployee to seek a new position or work assignment. Hence, an employee in displaced status would  \nnormally be assigned work during the displaced period. If an employee elects to seek employment within  \nthe Corporation he or she may do so for a period of ninety-one (91) days. At any time during the ninety-  \none days an employee may elect to terminate employment and receive RIF notice, benefits and severance  \npay. At the end of ninety-one days in displaced status, the employee\u2019s employment is subject to immediate  \ntermination. The terminating employee will receive RIF notice, benefits and severance pay. Extension of  \nthe ninety-one day period requires approval of the Director, Employee Relations.  \n644 If temporary work assignments are unavailable, the employee may go into no-pay status  \nbetween assignments; however, the employee is not normally subject to immediate termination of  \nemployment. Should a company-wide RIF occur, an employee may be subject to involuntary termination  \nduring the ninety-one day period in displaced status.  \n645 Disability Leave - Return to Work  \n646 The Corporation assists an employee\u2019s return from Disability leave to active employment  \ndirectly or through a rehabilitation program. The goal is to provide a reasonable time for the employee to  \nfind suitable work if the employee\u2019s position has been filled or eliminated during the leave, or if the  \nemployee is no longer able to perform that type of work. An employee returning from temporary disability  \nleave normally returns to the same organization and position. An employee may be put in displaced status  \n15  \nif his or her position has been eliminated or filled due to a critical need, or if the employee can no longer  \nperform the primary functions of that position.  \n647 An employee on temporary disability leave or Long-Term Disability (LTD) may participate  \nin a rehabilitation program that allows the employee, under approved circumstances, to return to work to his  \nor her previous position or similar position on a part-time basis. The employee will receive full-time  \nregular benefits from the Corporation, as well as pay for hours worked, and where the employee elected  \nLTD coverage, proportionally reduced disability benefits from the insurer, provided the insurer approves  \nthe individual\u2019s rehabilitation program.  \n648 Termination Pay  \n649 Employees who voluntarily terminate employment receive no termination pay. Employees  \nterminated involuntarily for reasons other than a reduction in force receive two (2) weeks\u2019 termination pay  \nif employed for six (6) months or more, or one (1) week\u2019s pay if employed for less than six (6) months.  \nEmployees terminated for cause sufficient to render continued employment detrimental to the corporation\u2019s  \ninterests or aS a consequence of ongoing corrective action receive neither advance notice nor termination  \npay.  \n650 An employee who is terminated in a reduction in force shall receive severance pay in  \naccordance with the Corporation\u2019s severance pay policies (see Appendix E, Employee Programs, Section 9,  \nSeverance Pay). If a person who has been so terminated is rehired, such person shall be rehired as a new  \nemployee unless the rehire is within a period of one (1) year and the person rehired repays to the  \nCorporation the sums he or she has received as pay in lieu of notice and severance pay to the extent such  \npay exceeds the product of the employee\u2019s weekly wage at the time of the reduction multiplied by the  \nnumber of weeks the employee was unemployed. Any sums so returned shall constitute the full extent of  \nthe severance pay available for such employee in the event of a subsequent reduction except that such  \nemployee shall thereafter accrue additional weeks of severance pay at the rate of one (1) week of severance  \npay for each year of subsequent employment up to a maximum total of nineteen (19) weeks.  \n651 A description of the benefits associated with a reduction in force is provided in Appendix  \nE, Employee Programs, Section 10, Reduction-In-Force (RIF) Benefits.  \n652 MTS Pay Plan  \n653 A description of the MTS salary structure is provided in Section 4 of Appendix B.

An APSA representative shall be  \nallowed to be present to represent the bargaining unit member in all meetings, which include the bargaining  \nunit member if requested by the member. The Corporation shall advise any member of the bargaining unit  \naccused of sexual harassment of the member\u2019s right to have an APSA representative present whenever the  \nmember is requested to attend any meeting regarding the alleged sexual harassment.  \n704 Once the investigation of an alleged sexual harassment incident has been concluded, the  \nVice President, Office of Human Resources, the General Counsel, and the Director, D&EEO Office  \nrecommend a course of action to the harasser\u2019s cognizant level 6 vice president if sexual harassment is  \nfound to have occurred. Whether sexual harassment has or has not been found to have occurred, upon  \nrequest the D&EEO Office shall provide a confidential written statement discussing the findings of the  \ninvestigation to the alleged harasser and/or harassee.  \n705 Either party, within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the findings and resolution, may file a  \nStep 3 grievance in accordance with Paragraph 1513 of this Agreement. A second independent  \ninvestigation may be necessary to resolve any outstanding issues. At the conclusion of the grievance, the  \nPeer Review Board issues a final decision.
