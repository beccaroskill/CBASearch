### HIRING HALL PROCEDURE  
### 
. The Union shall establish and maintain an open employ-  
ment list for the employment of workmen. Such list shal)  
be established and maintained on a non-discriminatory  
basis, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or  
national origin, and shall not be based on, or in any way  
affected by union membership, by-laws, rules, regula-  
tions, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect or  
obligation of union membership, policies or require-  
ments.  
2. Whenever desiring to employ workmen, the Employer  
shall call upon the Union for any workmen as the  
Employer may, from time to time need, and the Union  
Shall refer such workmen from the open employment list.  
The Employer shall give the Union twenty-four (24)  
hours notice when requiring the services of a workman  
—

4.  
covered hereunder, said notice time to be exclusive of  
Saturday, Sunday and Holidays.  
a) In notifying the Union of its need for the  
Employer shall specify to the Union: (1) the number  
of workers required, (2) the location of the project,  
(3) the nature and type of involved, (4)  
the work to be performed, and (5) such other infor-  
mation as may be necessary to enable the Union to  
make proper referral of applicants.  
b) When an Employer states requirements for special  
skills or abilities in his request for Employees, the  
Union shall refer the first applicant on the register  
possessing such skills and abilities.  
The Employer shall retain the absolute and uncondition-  
at right to reject any workman referred by the Union not  
possessing the requisite work qualifications, or special  
skills and abilities, since the Union is not to be deemed to  
guarantee same. However, in no case shall a referred  
workman be rejected without just cause. Any workman  
who is rejected by the Employer with just cause, shalt be  
restored to his place on the list.  
Ali members and registrants on hiring hall lists must per-  
sonally register and be properly identified and pho-  
tographed.  
. Recognizing that many older workers are restricted in  
the operation of heavy construction equipment by reason  
of technical advances and/or physical handicaps which do  
not, however, prevent them performing usefully and well,  
certain functions of the Operating Engineers’ craft, and  
with a view towards maintaining a source of employment  
for persons falling in this category, the hiring halt will  
maintain a “Limited Preferred Status List,” from which  
dispatch will be made for maintenance and operation of  
welding machines, compressors, elevators, house cars,  
peneratats, pumps, temporary heating equipment, con-  
veyors and tuggers.  
In order to qualify for referral from this list, the follow-  
ing criteria must be met:  
(a) The member or registrant must voluntarily submit  
his name for inclusion on the list for a minimum peri-  
od of six (6) months and during this time will not be  
eligible for referrals except as to equipment under  
the “Limited Preferred Status List.”  
(b) The member or registrant on the “Limited Preferred  
Status List” must be at least fifty-five (55) years of  
age and have had twenty years of experience in the  
industry as evidenced by his continuing  
on the Hiring Hall List, or in lieu thereof.  
(c)A person on the “Limited Preferred Status List"  
must have a bonafide physical handicap with proof  
thereof being submitted to the satisfaction of the  
Executive Board of Loca) Union 825, which handicap  
would unduly restrict his capacity to operate equip-  
ment other than that on the “Limited Preferred  
Status List.”  
(d) In view of the restriction on employment of those on  
the “Limited Preferred Status List” to the equipment  
specified herein, contractors may not request an  
6.  
7.  
8.  
9.  
Employee by name on this list.  
(e) In the event that the “Limited Preferred Status List”  
is exhausted and no one is available therefrom for  
employment, a registrant or member from the gener-  
al hiring halt list may be referred to a job normally  
filled by a person from the “Limited Preferred Status  
List.”  
When a man is referred from the hiring hall for employ-  
ment, he shall continue to retain his position at the top of  
the hiring hall list, until he has completed one hundred  
and twenty (120) hours of employment, after which time  
his name shall be re-registered in proper position as of  
the date of notification to the hiring hail of his availabil-  
ity,  
In order that the hiring hall list may correctly reflect the  
availability of registrants, each member and registrant  
must present himself in person at Jeast once a year to the  
hiring hall dispatcher for review of his registration card.  
Registration cards will contain information as to the  
equipment that the registrant can operate and his experi-  
ence in such operation. If a registrant has been dis-  
charged by two or more Contractors because of alleged  
inability to operate the equipment, the equipment in  
question will be removed from his hiring hall card, and he  
will not be dispatched on that equipment. If the regis-  
trant wishes to appeal the removal of the equipment  
from his card, he may request an opportunity to demon-  
strate his ability to the Local Union Examining commit-  
tee, at the Training Site.  
The dispatcher in making referrals from the hiring hall,  
based in part on an Employer’s request to reemploy a  
man who is available and who has had “recent employ-  
ment," shall not consider employment as “recent,”  
unless it was within the preceding one hundred and  
twenty (120) days from the date of request, exclusive of  
winter  
10. Unless otherwise provided by the Collective Bargaining  
1  
det  
Agreement with the Local Union, no person dispatched  
from the hiring hall will operate any machine or equip-  
ment other than those to which he was originally  
assigned to on referral, without approval of the hiring  
hall,  
_ When the machine or equipment to which a man was  
referred is moved to a different job or shut down, the  
operator must notify the hiring hall.  
12. No person selected for referral from the hiring hall will  
13.  
be allowed to refuse a job without just cause. Two such  
refusals without just cause will result in his displacement  
to the bottom of the hiring hall list.  
It shalt be the privilege of members and registrants to  
place their names on any one, or all, of the hiring hail  
lists maintained at the various Union offices throughout  
the jurisdiction of Locat 825.  
14. Upon request of a member or registrant, the hiring hall  
dispatcher shall inform him of his present position on  
the hiring hall referral list. If the member or registrant  
believes that his placement on the list is improper and  
discriminates against him with reference to a possibte  
ARTICLE f (continued)  
15.  
job referral, he shall have the right to review his position  
on the list. If the member or registrant continues to  
believe his placement on the list was improper or dis-  
criminatory he may file a claim pursuant to Section 15,  
of these rules.  
Any member or registrant on the employment list who  
makes written claim that he has been discriminated  
against in violation of his rights under the Labor  
Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, by  
exclusion from a job refersal, shall have the 1ight to an  
immediate appeal to a Joint Board consisting of two (2)  
members of the Union and two (2) repiesentatives of  
the Employer, who shal] be respectively designated  
upon the signing of the Collective Bargaining  
Agreement. Voting by members of the Joint Board  
Shall be on a unit basis. In case the Joint Board fails to  
reach a unanimous decision, the claim shal] be submit-  
ted expeditiously to an impartial umpire, to be agreed  
upon by the Joint Board, herein created, whose decision  
shall be binding and conclusive.  
The Claim of any member or registrant who feels that  
he has been discriminated against must be filed in writ-  
ing with the Union ten (10) days from the date of the  
alleged discriminatory practice, in order to entitle him  
16.  
to the benefits of the appeal procedure hereinbefore set  
forth.  
The cost and expense of establishing and maintaining  
the open list and of referrals therefrom, shall be borne  
by all of the registrants thereon. In the case of regis-  
trants, who are not members of the Union, their share  
of such costs and expenses shall not exceed a sum equal  
to the pro-rata share of the cost and expenses of oper-  
ating the employment list and the referrals therefrom,  
which is being borne by members of the Union from the  
payment of union dues. After seven (7) days from the  
date of this Agreement or of the date of registry on the  
list, whichever is later, registrants shall incur the obliga-  
tion of making quarterly payments of their share of such  
cost and expenses. Failure of a registrant to make pay-  
ment of such cost and expenses shall constitute grounds  
for removal from such list and shall nullify any prior  
referral therefrom.  
17. A registrant must have maintained his permanent resi-  
dence in the geographical area of the entire State of  
New Jersey and the five Southern Counties of New  
York (Delaware, Ulster, Orange, Sullivan and  
Rockland) for a period of one (1) year, or, who having  
had a permanent home in the area, has temporarily Jeft  
with the intention of returning to this area as his per-  
manent home,  
All references in the foregoing Hiring Hall Rules, to the  
masculine gender, shall be deemed to include the femi-  
nine gender.

### EMPLOYER SELECTED TRAINEE  
### 
Whenever the Employer requires the service of a  
trainee, requests must be made to the Operating Engincer’s  
Local 825 Apprenticeship Training Plan; and an indentured  
apprentice will be sent to the job site. If the Apprenticeship  
Training Plan is unable to provide an indentured appren-  
tice, the Employer may hire directly any person of its owa  
choice; however, such Employee, by reason of his hiring,  
will not become an enrollee nor part of the Indentured  
Apprenticeship Training Plan but he will have the right to  
make application for enrollment as all other persons.  
The Employer will have the sole and exclusive  
bility for training and job performance. No trainee will per-  
form work at the job site unless a Journeyman Engineer is  
actually engaged at the time in job site work. No trainee will  
be hired to replace or perform the work of a Journeyman,  
and trainees may not work as assistant Engineer/Oiler but  
may be employed as a paving equipment operator trainee  
or a dirt moving operator trainee. The trainee is not a “cov-  
ered Employee” under the terms of this Collective  
Bargaining Agreement nor is the Union his bargaining  
agent.  
The Employer must notify the Operating Engineers’  
Local 825 Apprenticeship Training Director before hiring a  
trainee and must furnish the name, address, social security  
number, race, sex and telephone number of such trainee.  
For information purposes only, on a monthly basis, the  
Employer will advise the Operating Engineers’  
Apprenticeship Training Director of the type of equipment  
and hours worked by trainees and of the wages paid for the  
first 1,000 hours of employment as a trainee and for the sec-  
ond 1,000 hours.  
If the Employer extends medical coverage to such  
trainee, then the cost of such coverage is the sole and exclu-  
sive responsibility of the Employer, and neither the Union  
nor the Operating Engineer’s Local 825 Welfare plan shall  
have any responsibility in connection therewith to the  
trainee or any person rendering hospital or medical services  
on his behalf.

### ARTICLE XVI  
### PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO MAKE  
### CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDS  
### 
The failure of any Employer to pay required contribu-  
tions to the Welfare, Pension, Supplemental  
Unemployment Benefit, Apprenticeship Training and  
Retraining, Annuity and Savings Funds, or to pay interest  
on such delinquencies, or legal and auditing fees and costs  
assessed against such delinquent Employer, as provided  
herein, shall constitute a violation of this Agrecment and  
the Union shall be authorized to remove the Employees  
from the job, in which case they shall report for work daily  
and shall be paid a day's pay of eight (8) hours until the  
Employer settles his delinquent payments of contributions,  
interest, legal and auditing fees with the Fund  
Administrator. If any Employer has a record of delinquen-  
cy on a prior job, the Union shall refuse to permit  
Employees to work for such Employer, until all such delin-  
quencies have been paid to the respective Funds, including  
interest and legal and auditing fees.  
If the Trustees or the Fund Administrator of any of said  
Funds is required to utilize legal services to collect  
Employer delinquencies or auditing services to ascertain  
the correct amount due from the Employer, the delinquent  
Employer shall be required to pay, in addition to 2% over  
the Prime Interest Rate, interest from date of delinquency,  
the reasonable cost of the auditing services and, in addition  
thereto, legal fees at the following rates: 15% on the first  
$750.00; 10% on any amount in excess of $750.00; mini-  
mum collector fee of $15.00; and 50% on any amount less  
than $100.00, due and payable on default.  
All contributions required to be made to any of the  
aforementioned Funds by the Employer shall be made on a  
weekly basis on the day the Employees are paid by the  
Employer delivering to the Lead Engineer or Shop Steward  
drafts made payable to each said Fund, in the amount  
required for each, for delivery to the Fund Administrator,  
together with completed farms, furnished by each Fund,  
indicating the names of afl Employees, number of hours  
worked or paid and amount of hourly wages as required,  
together with amount of contribution for each Employee to  
each Fund. Such periodic reporting forms must be filed by  
the Employer with the Fund(s) regardless of whether any  
contributions are due and owing the Fund(s) in the report-  
ing period unless the Trustees upon application of the  
Employer excuse him from so reporting. In the event that  
the contributions are due and owing in the reporting peri-  
od, the Employer shall so state on the form and the reasons  
therefore. With regard to the Savings Fund, the Employer  
shal] furnish to each Employee on payday a statement of  
the amount of money contributed on behalf of such  
Employee to the said Fund. The Funds Trustees will have  
13  
the right to conduct periodic payroll audits of companies  
signatory to this Agreement.  
The Trustees of any Fund or an alleged delinquent  
Employer may request arbitration of any alleged delin-  
quencies or breach of agreement regarding the Funds  
Contributions and arbitration may be heard within thirty  
(30) days after such request. The Trustees may join an indi-  
vidual Engineer as a party to any such arbitration proceed-  
ing agreement regarding Fund Contributions in which such  
Engineer may be involved. Each Engineer subject to this  
Agreement does hereby, through his duly authorized repre-  
sentative, consent to such joinder and to the issuance of an  
award binding upon him in connection therewith. The arbi-  
tration shall be heard at the Operating Engineers Loca] 825  
Funds Office, or as designated in the demand at the option  
of the Fund and the procedures followed shall be in accor-  
dance with the rules of the New Jersey Mediation Service.  
The Trustees in their discretion may permit an Employer  
to make monthly instead of weekly contributions where the  
contribution record of the Employer justifies such an  
action.  
All Employers covered by this Agreement must file with  
the Trustees of the Fringe Benefit Plan, a Surety Company  
Bond in an amount no less than $25,000.00 tn order to  
insure payment by them to the various Fringe Benefit Plans.  
The Trustees shall determine the amount of such Surety  
Bond. The Trustees shall also have the power to fix a lesser  
Bond for any Employer who pays weekly where the contri-  
bution record of such Employer justifies such action.  
However, effective January 1, 1982, any Employer may  
have aS af alternative option the opportunity to purchase  
combination stamps from the 825 Fund Facility and in lieu  
of posting a Surety Bond will contribute directly to the  
Employee these stamps as a medium of payment to the var-  
ious contributory Funds in the amount determined by hours  
paid. The payment of stamps to cach Employee will be  
made on a weekly basis on the Employer’s normal payday.  
(Article hercof).  
No officers, agents, representatives or Employees of any  
Union or of any Employer shali be deemed an agent or rep-  
resentative of the Board(s) of Trustees or be deemed as  
authorized to make any oral or written representations, or  
give any form of commitment which may be relied upon by  
the Employee, his or her spouse, beneficiary or dependent.  
It is further agreed and understood that no single Trustee or  
Employee(s) of any Fund has authority to give any such  
representations or comitments since such representations  
or commitments, unless authorized by the Boards of  
Trustees, can only be made by the Board of Trustees acting  
as Boards of Trustees.
