Agreement.  
(c) The term day when used in this procedure, shall be work days (Monday through Friday).  
(d) A grievant is the person affected by the misapplication or misinterpretation of this agreement.  
(e) It is agreed and understood that Association Representatives may, without loss of pay, with prior approval  
of the immediate supervisor, process grievances. The supervisor's approval shall not be unreasonably  
withheld. It is further agreed and understood that Association Representatives shall process grievances in  
such a manner as not to disrupt normal School Board operations and activities.  
Purpose  
The purpose of this grievance procedure is to settle equitably, at the lowest possible level, issues which may arise  
from time to time with respect to misapplications or misinterpretations of the provisions of this Agreement.  
Procedure  
(a) Time Limit - The number of days indicated at each level should be considered as maximum and every effort  
should be made to expedite the process. The time limits may be extended by mutual consent in writing by  
each party or by the representatives designated by each party.  
(b) Level One - A person who chooses to initiate this procedure shall do so in the following manner:  
(1) Following the awareness of a grievable event or incident, the grievant shall discuss the  
matter informally with his/her immediate supervisor.  
(2) In the event the matter is not resolved informally, the grievant may file a formal grievance on the  
form prescribed by the Department of Labor Relations as soon as possible and no more than  
twenty (20) days following the grievant's knowledge or awareness of the incident which is the basis  
of the grievance.  
(3) Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the formal grievance, in writing, to the supervisor, a meeting  
shall take place between the immediate supervisor, the grievant and, if either party desires, their  
representative. An answer to the grievance shall be given to the grievant, or the grievant s  
representative if applicable, in writing, within ten (10) days after the meeting.  
Level Two - If the grievant is not satisfied at Level One, he/she may transmit the grievance to the  
Superintendent by filing written notice within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the response in Level  
One. A meeting between the Superintendent, or designated representative(s), and the grievant shall take  
place within ten (10) days following the receipt of such notice to the Superintendent. The Superintendent's  
written decision shall be transmitted to the grievant or representative if applicable, within ten (10) days after  
the meeting.  
Level Three - If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level Two, or if no  
disposition has been made by the Superintendent within twenty (20) days from receipt of the grievance by  
the Superintendent, the grievance may be submitted by the grievant to arbitration before an impartial  
arbitrator, using the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS). The grievant, at his/her option,  
shall give written notice to the Superintendent of the grievant's intent to proceed through arbitration within  
twenty (20) days following the receipt of the Superintendent’s decision in Level Two. If the parties cannot  
agree as to the arbitrator within seven (7) days of the receipt of the list of arbitrators from FMCS, then the  
arbitrator will be selected by FMCS in accord with its rules. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to,  
subtract from, modify or alter the terms of the Agreement. The arbitrator shall render his/her decision in  
writing within (30) days after the close of the arbitration hearing and shall furnish a copy to the Association  
and the Board.  
If the Board does not agree within ten (10) days of receipt of the written notice that the matter is arbitrable,  
the Board shall notify the Association, in writing, that it disagrees as to the arbitrability of the grievance.  
The parties agree that in such an instance, an arbitrator will be selected, according to the rules of FMCS, to  
determine solely the question of arbitrability. If there is no objection by either party to the arbitrability of the  
grievance, and the above-mentioned procedure has been fully complied with, or results in a determination  
that the grievance is arbitrable, the parties shall proceed to arbitrate the grievance. The Board and the  
Association agree to make available, upon specific written request to the other, such information as is  
necessary to effectively process grievances. The cost of gathering the information shall be borne by the  
requesting party in accordance with Florida Statutes. Requests for such information shall allow a  
reasonable time prior to the Level II hearing (except that if the arbitration hearing is to determine  
arbitrability, then a reasonable time before a hearing Is set for the purpose) for collection of requested  
information. The Board and the Association shall not be permitted to assert in such arbitration proceeding  
any ground or rely on any evidence which has been specifically requested by the opposite party but which  
was not previously disclosed to the requesting party. Both parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator  
shall be final and binding on all parties. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by  
the Board and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them, and neither  
party shall be responsible for the expense of witnesses called by the other.  
Other provisions relating to the Grievance Procedure.  
(1) No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by or against any participant in the grievance procedure by  
reason of such participation.  
(2) lf the Association decides to withdraw its support of an alleged grievance, the individual may  
continue to process the claim on his/her own, so long as all costs are borne by that individual.  
6  
(3) All documents, communications and records dealing with processing of a grievance shall be filed in  
a separate grievance file and shall not be kept in the official personnel file of any of the  
participants.  
(4) Nothing in this agreement shall prevent the Association, an employee, or an individual grievant  
from withdrawing the grievance claim at any step of the process. A grievance, once withdrawn,  
may not be reopened without mutual agreement between the Board and the Association.  
(5) The time limits provided in this agreement shall be strictly observed unless extended by written  
agreement of both parties. Failure of the grievant to proceed with his/her grievance within the time  
hereinbefore provided shall result in the dismissal of the grievance. Failure of the Board or its  
representative to take the required action within the time provided shall entitle the grievant to  
proceed to the next step of this Grievance Procedure.  

### ARTICLE 3 - EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
### SECTION A - WORK YEAR AND WORKING HOURS  
### 
1.  
Workweek  
The basic workweek shall consist of forty (40) hours unless otherwise specified by the District. Where practical, to  
accomplish the mission of the District, the workweek should be scheduled in five (5) or less consecutive workdays.  
During the normal workday, hours shall be scheduled consecutively. The District shall establish the basic workday,  
workweek, work year and hours of work best suited to meet the needs of the department and to provide superior  
service to the District. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of limitation of the number of  
hours per day or days per week to be worked.  
When an employee is removed from his/her job duties and assigned temporary duties in a higher classification for  
fifteen (15) consecutive work days, the employee shall receive a five percent (5%) increase or the new minimum of  
the higher classification, whichever is greater. The increase will be retroactive to the first day of assignment in the  
higher classification. All reassignments in this provision shall be done by the Principal or Department Head. In no  
instance, however, will a paraprofessional | be eligible for substitute teacher or permanent substitute pay.  
Overtime  
All authorized and approved work actually performed by an employee in excess of forty (40) hours worked in any  
workweek shall be considered overtime and shall be compensated as follows:  
(a) One and one-half (1.5) times the regular rate of pay, or,  
(b) Compensatory time off which is earned at the rate of one and one-half hours (1 1/2) of compensatory time  
for each hour of overtime worked.  
Any employee who has requested the use of compensatory time, shall be permitted by the employer to use  
such time within a reasonable period after making the request. The use of compensatory time shall not be  
denied unless it unduly disrupts the operation of the employer. Compensatory time shall be scheduled  
7  
mutually between the employee and the supervisor.  
For the purpose of computing overtime, an employee should not be penalized for any District designated  
Holidays during that work week (Monday thru Friday).  
Duty Free Lunch  
All members of the bargaining unit shall be entitled to an uninterrupted duty-free lunch period without pay as  
follows:  
(a) Employees may have a lunch period as scheduled by the supervisor. In no event shall this lunch period be  
less than thirty (30) minutes.  
(b) An employee may leave the building and/or campus during his/her scheduled duty-free lunch period upon  
notification to the supervisor. However, in emergency situations, the supervisor may temporarily suspend  
the duty-free lunch period. An employee whose duty-free lunch period is suspended due to an emergency,  
will have such time credited as work time for compensation purposes, if their work schedule is not  
otherwise adjusted. Any employee who is away from the building and/or campus under this provision shall  
not be considered to be carrying out the responsibilities of his/her position and the Board shall not be liable  
for injury to the employee or damage to the property, unless the employee is performing  
authorized duties.  
Break Time  
Employees shall be provided a fifteen (15) minute break for each four (4) hours worked per day. Break time must  
be taken at a time convenient with the supervisor. By mutual consent, the two fifteen (15) minute breaks may be  
taken in conjunction with a thirty (30) minute lunch for a combined total of one (1) hour. Employees who work a ten-  
hour workday shall be provided with an additional fifteen (15) minute break.  
SECTION B - PERSONNEL PROCEDURES  
1.  
Transfer Requests/Involuntary Transfers/Temporary Transfers  
Employees wishing to transfer must apply directly to the school or department. Application is made by submitting a  
letter of application and resume. Employees desiring to transfer must possess the qualifications stated in Board  
approved job descriptions.  
(a) Involuntary Transfers  
An involuntary transfer shall be made only after a meeting between the employee involved and the  
supervisor. Such factors as length of service, job competency, and geographic location should be given  
consideration. The administration shall provide affected employees with a copy of comparable vacant  
positions. District shall give consideration to the wishes of the affected employee when placing that  
employee in an available position.  
(b) Temporary Transfers  
lf a regular employee is absent for greater than thirty (30) days, and another employee is assigned the  
responsibilities of the job description of the absent person, then the employee filling the absent  
responsibilities may request a review by his/her superior as to whether such employee is fulfilling the total  
8  
responsibilities of the absent job description.  
In such a case, the supervisor shall make a determination as to whether the employee is fulfilling the total  
responsibilities of the absent employee. If the supervisor determines the employee is fulfilling the total  
responsibilities of the absent job description, then such employee shall be given an interim appointment  
to the absent position. Payment for such interim appointment shall begin on the 31st duty day of  
performance of the total responsibility of the job description of the absent person.  
lf an employee disagrees with the determination of his/her immediate supervisor, such employee may request a  
review of such decision by the Superintendent. The Superintendent's decision in such cases shall be final and that  
decision is not subject to the grievance procedure.  
Temporaries  
The supervisor shall make a determination as to whether a temporary is required in the case of a long-term  
absence of an employee. However, the decision of the supervisor shall be final.  
Vacancies  
(a) All openings not filled from within the school or department, shall be listed as a job opening with Personnel  
Services.  
(b) Any job opening in a school or department will be posted prior to filling the position. The vacancy will be  
posted in the FOCUS on Education and on the Employment Hotline unless changed by some other form of  
advertising.  
(c) Current employees having the necessary qualifications shall be given equal consideration from among  
qualified applicants when available for such vacancies or promotions whenever possible.  
Evaluation  
(a) All members of the bargaining unit shall have one end of the school year written evaluation.  
(b) Prior to an end of the year evaluation that may result in “less than satisfactory,” a conference shall be  
arranged no less than twenty (20) work days prior to the formal evaluation being conducted to allow an  
employee the opportunity to improve his/her performance. At this conference a Memorandum of  
Assistance will be presented to the employee, which will state specific reasons why the job  
performance is considered unsatisfactory. This Memorandum will also state specific steps to take for the  
employee to improve his/her performance.  
(c) Employees will be given a copy of the written evaluation prepared by the supervising administrator or  
trained designee and will have the right to discuss such evaluation with his/her supervising administrator or  
trained designee.  
(d) The professional judgment of the evaluator and the content of the evaluation shall not be subject to the  
grievance procedure. Any other grievance filed under this section of the contract shall not be subject to  
9  
(g)  
binding arbitration.  
The employee shall have twenty (20) work days to attach a written statement of rebuttal to the evaluation.  
All written rebuttals shall be sent to the Department of Employee Records and Information Services and to  
the evaluator.  
No supervisor shall discuss any matter relating to the performance of an employee in the presence of  
students, parents or other employees. All personnel and/or confidential matters shall only be discussed in  
private offices.  
When three (3) or more criteria or areas of concern have been evaluated as unsatisfactory on the annual  
evaluation instrument, the performance will be rated as overall unsatisfactory for that year.  
Personnel File  
Evaluation statements and letters of reprimand and/or complaints shall not be placed in the employee’s personnel  
file in Personnel Services unless the employee has signed or been given a copy of the document. All such  
documents placed in the employee’s file shall be identified as to the source.  
An employee may, within twenty (20) work days after receipt of such document, file a statement of reaction to the  
document. The employee shall provide a copy to the originator of the document and a copy to Employee Records  
and Information Services; and such copy shall be attached to the originator’s copy and placed in the employee’s  
personnel file.  
Members of the bargaining unit shall have the right to examine their file at any reasonable time in the presence of a  
staff member from Employee Records and Information Services. Any employee may request copies of documents  
in the file. Such copies of documents shall be provided at the employee’s expense in accordance with Florida  
Statutes. An employee may request that a representative accompany him/her when the file is being reviewed by  
the employee. On notarized authorization, the employee may permit any designated person to examine his/her file.  
Job Descriptions and Assignments  
(a)  
The Board will prepare, review and revise job descriptions for those job classifications covered by the  
Agreement, as it deems necessary. The Division of Human Resources will provide the Association copies  
of new or revised job description and afford same the opportunity to review and comment prior to  
implementation.  
It is understood by the parties that every incidental duty connected with the functions enumerated in the job  
description is not specifically described. This does not preclude the requirement of performance by the  
employee of related duties.  
An employee in the bargaining unit will be afforded the opportunity to discuss and review his/her job  
description and regular working assignments with his/her supervisor. Ongoing regular duties will not be  
arbitrarily changed, nor instituted without verbal notification.  
Nothing in a job description is intended or shall be construed so as to concede to an employee, or group of  
employees, the right to refuse to follow instructions or orders.  
The Board maintains total authority to change job descriptions in any manner it sees fit in order to best  
manage its affairs and to accomplish the mission of the Board.  
10  
The employee shall be provided a revised copy of the new job description and, if necessary, be provided  
opportunity and available training within a reasonable length of time to learn new skills to continue in the  
job.  
Employees who allege they are regularly performing duties substantially divergent from those authorized in  
official job descriptions shall meet with their supervisor to resolve the issue. In the event that a solution is  
not reached, the employee may request a second conference with their immediate supervisor and that  
administrator's supervisor. In the event that a solution is not reached, the employee may request a  
conference with the Chief Personnel Officer. A complaint under this section is not subject to the grievance  
procedure.  
Job Reclassification  
(a)  
(b)  
Any employee, class of employees, or the Board, may make a request for job reclassification utilizing  
procedures established by the Superintendent, and the final decision shall be made by the Superintendent.  
When an employee is advanced to a position in a higher classification level, the employee will be placed  
within the appropriate classification level which will provide an hourly rate increase of five percent (5%), or  
the minimum hourly rate of the new classification level, whichever is greater.  
When an employee is transferred from one position to another position in the same classification level, the  
employee’s level/step shall remain the same.  
If an employee requests a change in position to a lower classification, and he/she has been employed in  
the present position for one full year of duty days or longer, the salary shall remain the same as long as the  
current salary is within the minimum and maximum of the salary level.  
lf an employee requests a change to a lower classification, and he/she has not been employed in their  
present position for a minimum of a full year of duty days, there will be a reduction of five percent (5%) of  
their annual salary. If employee’s salary after the five percent (5%) reduction is not within the salary range  
of the lower classification, the salary shall be adjusted to the maximum of the range for that  
classification.  
lf an employee is reassigned into a lower classification level due to excess, reorganization or other imposed  
change, the employee’s salary shall remain the same through the current fiscal year. However, if the salary  
was not within the range for the lower classification, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, the salary will  
be adjusted to the maximum of the range for that level.  
lf an employee has been promoted to a higher level or job classification and has been in the position for  
less than one full year of duty days and requests or is reassigned to the previous position or level held,  
he/she will be returned to the previous annual salary plus any raises that occurred in the interim.  
Assignment to Temporary Duty Elsewhere  
(a)  
A bargaining unit member may be assigned temporarily to duties other than his/her regular duties and  
place of employment. Such assignment to temporary duty will ordinarily originate with the Superintendent.  
All requests for assignment of temporary duty outside the county shall be submitted to the Superintendent  
at least ten (10) calendar days in advance. A member shall receive his/her regular pay and may be  
allowed expenses as provided by law, regulation of the State Board of Education, and Board Policies.  
11  
10.  
11.  
12.  
(b) Temporary duty within the District may be approved by the supervisor when no substitute service or other  
additional cost to the Board is involved.  
(c) The supervisor authorizing such temporary duty shall be responsible to ascertain that the temporary duty  
has been performed. No temporary duty forms need to be submitted for this type of assignment.  
(d) Such temporary duty shall be considered equal to the regular duties of the individual, and an employee  
performing such temporary duty shall not be considered on leave.  
(e) It is understood that such leave is provided only when the temporary assignment is necessary to effectively  
carry out the mission of the District and that such leave is not provided for personal reasons of the member  
or for Association business.  
Break in Service  
Employees who resign in good standing and are rehired within one (1) calendar year into a position in the same  
grade as the one previously held, may be rehired either at their former rate, grade and step, or the new minimum,  
whichever is higher. An employee who has been separated from the system for a period exceeding one (1) year  
shall be treated as a new employee.  
Seniority/Longevity Rights  
seniority shall be defined as the total length of continuous service with the Board. Seniority shall be district wide  
and shall date from the last effective date of employment. Time off for Board approved noncompensable leaves of  
absence shall count for seniority purposes and such leave shall not be considered as an interruption of service.  
Reduction-in-Force Policy  
In the event that a reduction in work force (RIF) becomes necessary due to declines in enrollment, budgetary  
restrictions, reorganization, or other causes as determined by the Board, the following reduction-in-work force  
provisions shall apply:  
(a) The Board will determine the classification(s) and assignments within the classification(s) to be reduced.  
The Superintendent will notify the Association’s President in advance of any pending reduction in work  
force action. When units are reduced, employees will be released in the inverse order of their length of  
time in the District within the classifications and assignment within the classification(s).  
(b) In the event that two (2) or more employees affected have the same amount of continuous service within  
the District, the Superintendent or designee shall make the decision of who shall be retained.  
Recall  
When employees are recalled from layoff, the employee with the greatest seniority in the District shall be recalled  
first. Employees in layoff status will retain recall rights for one year and shall have preference to work over  
applicants on eligible lists. Recall will be made by certified mail to the last address in the records.  
Within five (5) workdays of the certified receipt date or attempted delivery, laid-off employees must signify in writing  
to the Human Resources their intention of returning to work. Employees must return to their assigned work location  
within five (5) workdays of acceptance of recall. If an employee fails to respond to a recall notice or declines an  
offer, the next senior employee will be recalled. If an employee fails to respond or declines an offer three (3) times  
he/she will forfeit further recall rights.  
12  
If several positions within a recalled classification become available for recall at one time, the Superintendent, when  
recalling employees, shall first place the employees in the school or department from which they were laid off if  
such position is available. If such position is not available, then the Superintendent, when filling such positions,  
shall consider affirmative action goals, geographic location, preference of the senior employee, and the needs of  
the District. However, the decision of the Superintendent shall be final. If an employee fails to accept an offer of  
recall, the employee forfeits all recall rights.  
Any accrued sick leave of record at the time of layoff shall be restored at the time the employee is rehired. An  
employee who is on layoff status is eligible to apply for any other position, and if re-employed by the District, the  
employee forfeits rights to recall.  
Terminal Pay Benefits  
(a) An employee who retires and submits proof of eligibility from the Florida Retirement System or whose  
employment is terminated by death shall receive payment for accrued sick leave days. Such  
compensation shall be the daily rate of pay at retirement or death of the employee multiplied by the  
maximum percentage provided for by Florida Statute times the number of accumulated sick leave days. In  
the event service is terminated by death, benefits shall be paid to the beneficiary as identified on the  
employee's group life insurance form.  
(b) Accrued Annual Leave: A member of the bargaining unit shall receive payment for all accrued vacation  
leave (if applicable) at his/her daily rate at time of resignation or termination, retirement, or to his/her  
beneficiary, if service is terminated by death, as terminal leave pay. Resignation or termination shall be the  
last duty day an employee is physically on duty unless the employee is by necessity required to resign or  
terminate while on sick leave.  
Performance-Based Termination/Suspension  
(a) Any employee whose performance is deemed to be less than satisfactory by his/her supervisor shall be so  
advised in writing of such unsatisfactory performance by the supervisor.  
(b) The employee will be provided assistance to improve his/her performance.  
(c) No employee shall be recommended for termination/suspension based on an unsatisfactory evaluation  
unless he/she has been given at least thirty (30) calendar days to improve his/her performance.  
(d) An employee who will be recommended to the Board for termination/suspension shall be given notice, in  
writing, with documentation stating the reasons. The employee shall be given prior notice if the  
Superintendent is recommending termination/suspension prior to Board action.  
(e) After Board action, an employee may, within fifteen (15) days, protest his/her performance-based  
termination/suspension through either the grievance procedure or the Department of Administration  
Hearings (DOAK).

promotional probationary period, either the District or the employee can cancel the promotion for any or no  
reason. The decision not to continue an employee in the promoted position and/or the written feedback  
shall not be the subject of a grievance procedure. In the event the promoted employee does not continue  
in the higher classified position for 90-days, he/she shall be given a position at the same level and with the  
same benefits he/she received prior to the promotion.

Superintendent for additional compensation leave days. If the Superintendent is satisfied that the condition  
warrants, he/she shall recommend additional compensated leave to the Board.

inoculations are not available and exclusive of upper respiratory infections or complications therefrom at the  
school/department to which he/she is assigned, may qualify for a maximum additional twenty-two (22) days  
for non-cumulative sick leave if the disease requires the employee to use more than five (5) days of his/her  
accumulated sick balance. If the employee does not have the five (5) days of accumulated sick leave, this  
leave shall begin immediately after the use of the last sick leave day.  
Catastrophic Illness or Injury

A catastrophic illness or injury shall be defined as a medical condition not covered by Workers’  
Compensation, requiring absence from work greater than fifty (50) working days of consecutive absence for  
a single illness or injury.

matching basis, supplementary catastrophic illness or injury leave not to exceed the number of regular  
unused sick leave days that the employee had accumulated on the first day of the regular sick leave  
applied to the catastrophic illness or injury.

holiday or the first or last week of the school year when students are in attendance, at the discretion of the  
supervisor.  
Permanently and Totally Disabled Employees

an employee based upon the determination that the employee is permanently and totally disabled pursuant to  
applicable Workers’ Compensation statutes, rules and regulations. To the extent allowed by statutes, the employee  
will receive his/her terminal pay for any unused sick leave and/or annual leave and any leave the employee is on

abortion, miscarriage, or related medical conditions, or recovery therefrom. It does not include leave taken or  
requested for personal reasons related to maternity, e.g., preparing for the birth of a child or caring for an infant  
where there is no accompanying disability.  
Once an expected date of confinement has been established, no further medical statement is required for sick leave  
if maternity disability (use of accrued sick days) occurs within three (3) weeks prior to the expected date of delivery  
or within six (6) weeks after the actual birth of the child. Any extended sick leave for maternity outside these nine  
(9) weeks must be supported by a physician’s statement. If accrued sick leave is not sufficient, or if an employee  
elects not to use accrued sick leave for maternity, unpaid personal leave may be used.  
Short term illness related to maternity is treated as the same as any other day-to-day illness.

one additional year provided that the total time away from the job is not more than eighteen (18) months.
