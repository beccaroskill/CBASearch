and in the capacities and status designated in Article 2 hereof, estab-  
lishes rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, fringe benefits and  
vacations, where applicable and other terms and provisions concerning  
employment relations and collective bargaining relations, and collec-  
tive bargaining between or involving such parties on construction work  
in the State of Minnesota.  
NOW, THEREFORE, for such purposes, it is agreed as follows:  
A. The considerations for this Agreement are the mutual promises of  
the parties and their mutual purposes to establish, maintain and  
promote sound and harmonious labor relations,  
It is desirable to maintain the cooperative relationships and juris-  
dictional work assignments existing during past years between the  
Employers and the employees represented by the Union.  

### ARTICLE 2  
### Designation of Parties  
### 
A. Associated General Contractors of Minnesota (hereinafter called  
AGC), and affiliated organizations are a party to this Agreement in  
a representative capacity and as agent only, acting on behalf of cer-  
tain of its members who have agreed to be bound to the terms of  
1  
this Agreement through AGC, and on behalf of such additional  
Employers as may execute identical counterparts. The AGC is enti-  
tled to recognition in such capacity, as agent and collective bar-  
gaining representative for the Employers who are or may become  
parties hereto, for all purposes of this Agreement including its right  
in such capacity to represent such Employer parties before NLRB  
or otherwise pursuant to and/or in aid, support or enforcement of  
the terms and provisions of this Agreement.  
. The AGC members who have agreed to be bound to the terms of  
this Agreement through the AGC, or other Employers who have  
done likewise (hereinafter called Employers) are parties hereto as  
principals, but their status is several and not joint.  
Such parties shall be bound by this Agreement unless the Council  
is notified in writing by those dissenting within thirty (30) days of  
the signing of this Agreement.  
. The labor organizations on their own behalf and on behalf of Car-  
penters, Piledrivers, and their Apprentices whom they represent  
and on whose behalf they are recognized (hereinafter called Union)  
are parties hereto. The status of said Union is dual, in that they are  
parties hereto as principals and also as agents for the employees  
whom they represent and on whose behalf they are recognized or to  
be recognized as hereinafter provided.  

### ARTICLE 3  
### Union Recognition  
### 
. Employers hereby recognize each of the Unions to which the Con-  
tractor has agreed to be bound, as the exclusive collective bargain-  
ing representative of the employees in the craft signatory to this  
Agreement, in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment  
and fringe benefits, where applicable, and other conditions of  
employment. The respective Unions are hereby recognized hereun-  
der by the Employers as the sole and exclusive bargaining repre-  
sentatives of the employees respectively represented by them. The  
respective Unions represent that they are qualified for such  
recognition,

ing construction work, exclusive of maintenance and repair shops,  
with their employees on whose behalf any of the Unions have been  
granted recognition hereunder individually or collectively which in  
any way conflicts with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.  
If the Union enters into any Agreement with any individual  
Employer or group of Employers competing in the same type of  
work as defined in this Agreement, which provides for different  
2  
wages, hours or conditions than as herein specified, the Employer

There shall be no discrimination against any employee because of  
race, color, creed, political/religious beliefs, sex, disability, national ori-

in this Agreement, it is understood that these references or any other  
references, are generic and shall apply equally to the female gender.  
The Employer shall not discriminate against any employee as long  
as the employee is performing work assigned in a safe, normal and  
workmanlike manner.  
The Unions recognized under Article 3 of this Agreement shall be  
entitled to union security to the extent that each employee in the col-  
lective bargaining unit represented by such Union shall on the eighth  
(8th) day following the beginning of employment in such collective bar-  
gaining unit by such Employer under the coverage of this Agreement  
or the effective date of this Agreement whichever is later, be required

### ARTICLE 7  
### Grievances, Disputes and Arbitration  
### 
A. Any controversy over the interpretation of or adherence to the  
terms of this Agreement shall first be attempted to be resolved  
between the Union and the Employer. Any controversy or grievance  
shall be deemed to be waived unless submitted in writing within  
ten (10) working days after the first occurrence of the event or  
knowledge of the condition giving rise to the grievance.  
B. If a satisfctory settlement cannot be reached within five (5) work-  
ing days the matter may be brought to the AGC-Basic Trades Dis-  
pute Board if both parties agree in writing. In such case the griev-  
5  
ing party shall submit a written statement of the claim and facts of  
the matter to other parties including the Employer, the Union and  
the AGC. (The rules of the Disputes Board shall be those already  
adopted by the Joint Committee).  
Both parties must sign the Agreement to bring the matter to the  
Disputes Board. Both parties must sign the document binding  
them to the Board decision. If either party does not attend the  
meeting after signing above and being notified of the meeting date  
and time, a decision will be rendered though they are not present.  
Decisions of the Disputes Board will be drafted at the conclusion of  
the meeting, signed by members of the Board, and distributed to  
both parties at that time.  
. The disputes board is to be made up of equal numbers of Manage-  
ment and Labor representatives, who will meet regularly to settle  
any disputes, (other than jurisdictional disputes) to avoid work  
stoppages, or other problems affecting productivity. This Board  
shall have no power to add to, delete, or modify, any of the terms or  
provisions of this Agreement. All decisions of the Disputes Board  
shail be final and binding on the parties. If either party, after sign-  
ing above documents, refuses to abide by the decision of the Dis-  
putes Board, economic action may be taken by the other party.  
. Should the Disputes Board, as established, be unable to reach a  
decision on the matter before it, or because of a deadlock (lack of  
majority) or if either party refuses to use the Joint Disputes Board  
then the matter may be referred to a Board of Arbitration that shall  
operate in the following manner: The Union shall appoint an Arbi-  
trator and the Employer shal! appoint an Arbitrator within ten (10)  
working days and the two Arbitrators thus selected shall appoint a  
Neutral Chairman. In the event of the failure of the Arbitrators  
selected by the parties to agree on a Neutral Chairman within ten  
(10) working days after the dispute is referred to arbitration, they  
shall ask the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for a list  
of five (5) names from which the aggrieved party shall strike the  
first two (2) names and the other party shall then strike two (2)  
names, and the final name shall be selected as the Neutral Chair-  
man. The Neutral Chairman thus selected shall set the time and  
place for hearings, which shall begin no later than ten (10) working  
days after his selection, with the final decision to be handed down  
in not more than ten (10) working days after the last hearing is  
held. The time may be extended by mutual agreement between the  
parties. The decision of the Arbitrators shall be final and binding on  
signatories to this Agreement who are parties to the dispute; pro-  
vided, however, that the Arbitrators shail have no power to add to,  
delete, or modify any provisions of this Agreement.

will pay all expenses of its Arbitrator, and the Employer and the  
Union will share equally all fees and expenses of the Neutral

### Subcontractors  
### WORK PRESERVATION  
### 
To protect and preserve, for the employees and their Employers cov-  
ered by this Agreement, work traditionally having been performed by  
the Employers and assigned to employees under this Agreement or its  
predecessor Agreements, and to prevent intentional interference with  
the protection and preservation of such work, it is agreed as follows:  
SUBCONTRACTING  
There are four (4) different districts relating to subcontracting, basi-  
cally along county lines; however where cities or towns fall on Bound-  
ary lines, the city limits or towns are referenced separately at the end  
of the article under the heading "Cities and Towns on Boundary Lines,”  
and are covered by the subcontracting language applicable to  
those areas.  
SUBCONTRACTING LANGUAGE FOR DISTRICT 1 ONLY  
With regard to work traditionally having been performed by the  
Employers and assigned to employees under this Agreement or its pre-  
decessor Agreements on the job-site, if the Employer subcontracts such |  
work to a subcontractor, the Employer shall require that such subcon-  
tractor be signatory to a current collective bargaining agreement with  
the Union covering such work.  
This provision shall be enforceable through Article 7, Settlement of  
Disputes. In addition to any amount payable to the joint Employer/  
Union Trust Funds covering pensions, health and welfare and vacation  
and/or the joint apprenticeship program, an arbitrator enforcing this  
Agreement shall have authority to award other damages to be payable  
to one or more of the above Employer/Union Trust Funds.  
The above language pertains to District 1 only, which shall consist of  
Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Hennepin, Isanti, Kanabec, Pine,  
Ramsey, Scott, Sherburne, Washington and Wright counties in Min-  
nesota, and the territory in Wisconsin described in Article 4 of this con-

nesota and the territory in Wisconsin described in Article 4 of this con-  
tract. (See "Cities or Towns on Boundary Lines")  
SUBCONTRACTING LANGUAGE FOR DISTRICT 2 ONLY  
If the Employer subcontracts carpentry work to be performed at the  
jobsite, the Employer shall require the subcontractor to sign a Subcon-  
tract Agreement containing the following provision:  
"The subcontractor agrees to comply with the provisions relating to  
wages, fringe benefits, premium pay and on-the-job working conditions  
in the current collective bargaining agreement entered into between  
the AGC and the Lakes and Plains Regional Council of Carpenters &  
Joiners for the duration of the Employer's project."  
The Employer shall require the subcontractor to sign a Subcontract  
Agreement containing the foregoing provision only when performing  
carpentry work on the project, and when the subcontractor does not  
represent to the Employer that he has an established building trade’s  
collective bargaining agreement covering the affected classification  
of work.  
The above language pertains to District 2 only, which shall consist of  
Meeker, McLeod, LeSueur, Rice, Goodhue (Note: See Red Wing exclu-  
sion in cities or towns on Boundary lines), Wabasha, Blue Earth,  
Waseca, Steele, Dodge, Olmsted, Winona, Faribault, Freeborn, Mower,

south on #23 to the south line of Nicollet County. NOTE: Extending 20  
miles beyond the town or city limits of New Auburn, Gaylord, New  
Sweden and Nicollet shall be in Subcontracting District 4. (See "Cities  
or Towns on Boundary Lines")  
SUBCONTRACTING LANGUAGE FOR DISTRICT 3 ONLY  
1. If the Employer subcontracts bargaining unit work, the Employer  
will subcontract such work only to another Employer which has a  
current collective bargaining agreement with this Union covering  
such bargaining unit work.  
2. Where the Employer is competing against non-union prime con-  
tractors, or where Union subcontractors are not available, or where  
the project owner designates certain non-union subcontractors to  
be used on the project, the contractor shall notify the Union who  
the non-signatory contractor is, and provide the total wage package  
to be paid to employees of this subcontractor in writing, in a time-  
ly manner.  
3. It is agreed that not more than one (1) non-signatory subcontractor,  
limited to one phase (i.e. drywall/steel framing, wood framing, roof-  
ing, etc.) of bargaining unit work on a jobsite shall be utilized, as  
specified in Paragraph 2 above, All others shall comply with para-  
graph 1 of this subcontractor clause.  
If the Employer is unable to comply with this Section (3) due to avail-  
ability of signatory subcontractors, it is agreed that the Union and the  
Employer will convene to resolve the problem.  
The above language pertains to District 3 only, which consists of  
Stearns counties and the area surrounding the City of St. Cloud and

The parties agree to not subcontract any work that the contractor  
normally performs in order to avoid the terms and conditions of this  
Agreement. They also agree that it is mutually desirable to have work  
performed by subcontractors working for the contractor who is a party  
to the Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement, and the con-  
tractor will, in letting subcontracts, endeavor to obtain this objective.

15th of the following month, hereinafter called the “due date,” such  
sums for Pension, Health and Welfare, Vacation, Delta Dental, Appren-  
ticeship and Promotion Funds as they may be established, an amount  
for each hour worked by all employees covered by this Agreement.  
Each payment shall be accompanied by a report in a form as specified  
by the Trustees. The Funds’ Trustees shall equally represent the Union  
and the Employer. The terms of the Trust Agreement establishing  
those Funds are hereby incorporated as a part hereof.  
A. An Employer shall be considered "delinquent" for a particular work  
month (or work week in the case of Employers on weekly reporting  
under (c) below) if its required report and the proper payment for  
that month (week) are not postmarked on or before the l5th day of  
the following month (Friday of the following week) (the "due date"),  
irrespective of whether such delinquency is willful or otherwise.  
B. Contributions which are delinquent as defined in (A) above shall be  
deemed to be “unpaid contributions” for purposes of the Funds'  
remedies pursuant to this Agreement and applicable law. An  
Employer who is delinquent and has unpaid contributions shall be  
required to pay to the Funds an additiona! amount of 10% of the  
amount of the unpaid contributions as liquidated damages togeth-  
er with interest on the unpaid contributions as specified in the  
Trust Agreement, or if greater, two times the specified interest on  
the unpaid contributions,  
C. In addition to other remedies provided herein, if an Employer is  
habitually delinquent, defined as being delinquent twice in a  
twelve (12) month period, the trustees may require a bond or a  
deposit of an estimated amount of future contributions and/or may  
require that the Employer make weekly fringe fund reports and  
payments for 26 consecutive weeks without further delinquency.  
“Weekly basis” shall mean that the Employer’s report and payment  
for a particular work week shall be due on the Friday of the follow-  
ing week (the “due date”), An Employer's report and payment shall  
be considered "delinquent” if not postmarked on or before such day.  
D. The Employer may demand that the question of his failure to pay  
the amount due the Trusts be submitted to arbitration according to  
the Contract. Providing such request is submitted to the Union in  
writing within 72 hours after receipt of the above notice, and pro-  
vided further that the Employer deposit in escrow with the Admin-  
istrator of the Fund the amount of the claimed delinquent pay-  
ments, Upon the filing of the request for arbitration and the  
14  
depositing of the amount in dispute, the Union will not engage in  
any economic activities pending the resolution of such dispute.  
. Illustration of clauses A,B,C and D: If an Employer's report and  
payment for the January work month have not been postmarked  
before February 16, such contractor becomes delinquent at that  
point and must pay the full amount due, plus interest and 10% as  
liquidated damages or, if greater, double interest. In addition, the  
Employer shall be placed on the weekly reporting basis for work  
weeks commencing after February 16. Reports and payments shall  
then be due each week on the Friday of the week following the work  
week until the Employer has completed 26 consecutive weeks with-  
out further delinquency.  
- The delinquent Employer shall also be required to pay all cost of  
collection actually incurred by the Trust Fund, including all attor-  
ney fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter fees and al! other  
fees, costs and disbursements incurred by or on behalf of the Trust  
Funds in collecting the amount due.  
. Each Employer who is required to make payment to the Trust  
Funds shall promptly furnish to the Trustees or their authorized  
agents, on demand, all necessary employment and payroll records  
relating to its employees covered by this Agreement, including any  
other relevant information that may be required in connection with  
the administration of the Trust Funds. The Trustees or their autho-  
rized agents may examine such employment or payroll records  
whenever such examination is deemed necessary in connection  
with the proper administration of the Trust Funds upon authoriza-  
tion of the Trustees.  
If any Employer fails or refuses to furnish its payroll records to the  
Trustees or their authorized agents upon demand or refuses to  
afford the Trustees, or their authorized agents reasonable opportu-  
nity to examine the same in accordance with standard auditing  
procedures, the Trustees may enforce such right by legal action in  
which event all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter  
fees, and other legal costs and disbursements, as well as the audit-  
ing fees and costs incurred in conducting such audit, shall be paid  
by such Employer on direction of the Trustees.  
. The Unions shall also have the right to take economic action,  
including but not limited to the nght to refuse to supply personnel,  
to enforce the rights enumerated in this Article on behalf of the  
Unions and the Trustees. The parties to this Agreement acknowl-  
edge that the provisions of this Agreement establishing rates of  
pay, wages, all hours of employment and other terms and conditions

ters & Joiners for the duration of the Employer's project.”

tors, or where Union subcontractors are not available, or where the  
project owner designates certain non-union subcontractors to be  
used on the project, the contractor shall notify the Union who the  
non-signatory contractor is and provide the total wage package to be  
paid to employees of this subcontractor in writing, in a timely  
manner.  
3) It is agreed that not more than one (1) non-signatory subcontractor,

mit work.

lishing those funds are hereby incorporated as a part hereof.

paragraph c below, shall be considered “delinquent” for a particular  
work month if its required report and the proper payment for that  
month are not postmarked on or before the fifteenth (15th ) day of  
the following month (the “due date”), irrespective of whether such.  
delinquency is willful or otherwise.

deemed to be “unpaid contributions” for purposes of the Funds’  
remedies pursuant to this Agreement and applicable law, An

habitually delinquent, defined as being delinquent twice in a  
twelve (12) month period, the trustees may require a bond or a  
deposit of an estimated amount of future contributions and/or may  
require that the Employer make weekly fringe fund reports and  
payments for 26 consecutive weeks without further delinquency.

for a particular workweek shall be due on Friday of the following  
week (the “due date”). An Employer’s report and payment shall be

contract. Providing such request is submitted to the Union in write  
ing within seventy-two (72) hours after receipt of the above notice,  
and provided further that the Employer deposit in escrow, the  
amount of the claimed delinquent payments with the Administra-  
tor of the Fund. Upon the filing of the request for arbitration and

est and 10% as liquidated damages, or if greater, double interest. In  
addition, the Employer shall be placed on the weekly reporting  
basis for workweeks commencing after February sixteenth (16th).

pleted twenty-six (26) consecutive weeks without further delin-  
quency.  
' The delinquent Employer shall also be required to pay all costs of  
collection actually incurred by the Trust Fund, including all attor-  
ney fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter fees, and all other  
fees, costs and disbursements incurred by or on behalf of the Trust  
Funds in determining, assessing and collecting the amount due.  
_ Each Employer who is required to make payments to the Trust  
Funds shall promptly furnish to the Trustees or their authorized  
agents, on demand, all necessary employment and payroll records,  
and any other relevant information relating to its employees cov-  
ered by this Agreement for examination, whenever such examina-  
tion is deemed necessary in connection with the proper adminis-  
tration of the Trust Funds.

demand to the Trustees or their authorized agents of refuses to  
afford the Trustees or their authorized agents reasonable opportu-  
nity to examine the same (in accordance with standard auditing  
procedures), the Trustees may enforce such rights by legal action,
