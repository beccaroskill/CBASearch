### ARTICLE I  
### Exclusive Bargaining, Employment and General Terms and Conditions  
### 
1. The Association signatory hereto recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective  
bargaining agent for a majority of all persons employed as Carpenters in the geographical area  
coming within the jurisdiction of the Union; and  
The Union recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for  
its members, the majority of contractors engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and  
heavy construction work, for the purpose of collective bargaining in the geographical area  
coming within the jurisdiction of the Union.  
2. It is specifically agreed and understood that this Agreement exclusively governs the wages,  
terms, and conditions of employment of all Carpenters performing work of any description  
coming under the jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,  
employed by an Employer represented through the Association, the majority of contractors  
engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and heavy construction work, regardless of  
whether such Employer is acting in the capacity of a prime or subcontractor.  
3. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they are subject to state and federal law and  
municipal ordinances regarding equal employment opportunity and fair employment practices  
and therefore will jointly take the necessary steps to comply with these laws and ordinances  
within the scope of this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will in no way  
discriminate against any person based on race, color, religion or creed, sex (including pregnancy,  
gender identity and sexual orientation), national origin or ancestry, age (40 or older), veteran  
status, citizenship, disability or genetic information, reprisal, or any other protected class defined  
by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  
1  
   
4. The Union agrees to furnish competent workers, if available, upon notification to the office  
of the Union or authorized person or persons. The Employer and Union agree that in the interest  
of job equity, there shall be no discrimination because of age and both parties shall endeavor to  
give favorable consideration to the employment of Carpenters who are 55 years of age or older  
providing such persons are capable to perform the work required.  
5. The Employer agrees that in the employment of workers to perform the various  
classifications of labor required under this Agreement, he will not discriminate against applicants  
because of membership or non-membership in the Union. Each employee shall, as a condition of  
employment, become and remain a member of the Union for the term of his employment, after  
the seventh (7th) calendar day after the beginning of his employment by an Employer or  
Employers in the area covered by this Agreement, or seven (7) days after the date of this  
Agreement, whichever is the later.  
The Employer shall be furnished with a notice in writing by the Union, setting forth that the  
employee has refused to join the Union, although he has been offered membership on the same  
terms as other members or that the employee’s membership in the Union has been terminated for  
reason of nonpayment of dues or regular initiation fees. The Union will also provide the affected  
Employers with written notification of all members that have opted out of union dues collection.  
(a) In the event the National Labor Relations Act is amended, while this Agreement is in force  
so that an employee may lawfully be required to become a member of the Union as a  
condition of employment in less than seven (7) days, then such shorter period of time shall  
immediately become operative under this Agreement notwithstanding the provisions of  
Paragraph 5 above.  
(b) The Employer shall not be obligated hereunder to discharge or discriminate against any  
employee for non-membership in the Union:  
(1) If he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the  
employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or  
(2) If he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for  
reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation  
fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.  
(c) The Union will hold the Employers and the Association harmless and indemnify them from  
any loss suffered, including defense costs, as a result of any Employee claims, charges,  
actions or lawsuits of any kind in which the Employers and/or the Association are named as a  
party or responding party, claims of actions related to the union dues deduction and  
membership obligations under P.A. 348 of 2012; or any action, claim or suit relating to the  
negotiations of this Collective Bargaining Agreement provided the Union is given at least 30  
days’ written notice of such claims, charges, actions or lawsuits from the time the Employer  
or Association is served with and receives same and the Union retains the right to tender a  
defense to such claims, charges, actions or lawsuits on their behalf, unless prohibited by  
Federal law.  
   

### ARTICLE II  
### Jurisdiction  
### 
1. This Agreement covers all employees performing carpentry work coming under the  
jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, as determined by  
Agreements and Decisions of Record (such as "Plan for Settling Jurisdictional Disputes  
Nationally and Locally") and by area practices in the area covered by this Agreement.  
2. If, in the exercise of his management rights, the Employer makes a specific assignment of  
any work to an employee covered by this Agreement, the Employer agrees to provide a letter to  
the Union recording the specific assignment if requested to do so in writing by a Representative  
of the Union.  
3. To keep both parties to the Agreement fully informed of jurisdictional assignments made to  
the Union, the Union agrees to provide the AGC of Michigan a copy of both the original request  
and any Employer's (including non-Association employers) letter regarding the assignment. The  
letter should provide all appropriate information including project name and location, quantity,  
description, and specifics of the work assigned.  
4. In the event of a jurisdictional dispute involving the Union, the parties shall request the other  
union or unions involved to send representatives to the jobsite to meet with representatives of the  
Union and Employer to settle the dispute. If a settlement is not reached at that meeting the Union  
shall request that its International Union assign a representative who shall make arrangements to  
meet representatives of the other International Union or Unions involved and representatives of  
the Employer on the jobsite to seek settlement of the dispute. The Employer shall also request  
the International Unions involved to assign representatives to seek settlement of the dispute. The  
Union agrees that there shall be no work stoppages or strikes over jurisdictional disputes while  
such disputes are being processed.  
5. In the event the Association becomes a party to a National Board, or a Local or State Board  
is established to which the Association is a party, this Article shall be revised to include such  
participation.  
6. Pre-job Conferences. When requested by the Union, the Employer agrees to hold a pre-job  
conference to discuss carpentry work to be performed on said job and consider assignments of  
work, following established Agreements and Decisions rendered affecting the building industry.  
7. The Employer and/or General Contractor agree to provide the names of all known carpentry  
subcontractors, directly under contract, on the specific project if requested of the project  
superintendent by the Union representative. Such information shall be made available to the  
union representative within 48 business hours after award of contract and upon written request.  
8. The Union recognizes the following associations, AGC, ACTA, CCA, and WCA as the sole  
and exclusive representatives for their perspective members, the vast majority of contractors  
engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and heavy construction work in the geographical  
area coming within the jurisdiction of the Union. In recognition of these associations’ standing  
in the industry, the Union shall designate to these associations’ sponsored industry promotion  
funds all IAP contributions paid by their respective members and any other employer performing  
work within the Union’s geographical jurisdiction, who is not signatory to another multi-  
employer association collective bargaining agreement with the Union, or is not otherwise a party  
to a separate multi-employer industry promotion trust fund.  
   
   

### ARTICLE I  
### General Principles  
### 
1. There shall be no restriction on the use of Employer-furnished tools, machinery, power  
equipment, mechanical equipment or mechanical devices, such as gin poles, except when, in the  
opinion of the employee, it has become unsafe. There shall be no discrimination against an  
employee who has claimed that such items indicated above have become unsafe. Any dispute  
arising out of a claim of unsafe equipment shall be settled in conformance with Paragraph 3 of  
Article XIII, “Steward”, of this Agreement.  
2. Change House. The Employer shall furnish suitable heat for the purpose of drying clothes;  
reasonable, comfortable, and large enough quarters for the exclusive use of all his Carpenters on  
the job, including suitable storage for tools under lock; and shall provide proper sanitation and  
suitable sanitary containers for drinking water with paper cups or a bubbler.  
3. Parking. The Employer will furnish adequate parking within a reasonable distance.  
4, Tool/Clothing Loss. The Employer shall be responsible for the worker's tools and clothing  
for loss by fire and/or burglary on the jobsite when the project is not operating; provided that the  
employee shall have given the Employer an itemized list of his tools by noon of the second day  
on the job. Such liability shall be limited to not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) for  
loss of tools and Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) for loss of clothing for each employee.  
Employers shall be responsible for tools lost due to damage or accident during working hours  
provided that such loss is not the result of the employee's negligence. The Labor/Management  
Productivity & Training Committee will periodically send to Carpenters and Employers an  
explanation of their obligation under the tool loss provision in the contract accompanied by a  
form to be used for reporting tools brought onto the jobsite.  
5. Safety. The Employer agrees to register with the Michigan Construction Safety Commission  
and cooperate with its provisions on safety. The Union shall cooperate with the individual  
Employer in carrying out all pertinent rules and regulations dealing with health, safety and  
welfare of employees promulgated by the aforesaid Commission. All employees shall perform  
their duties in each operation in such manner as to promote safe operations of each particular  
duty and of any job as a whole.  
(a) No employee shall be discharged for refusing to work under conditions injurious to his  
health or safety as determined under any rule or regulation of the State of Michigan or any  
political subdivision thereof. Such determination shall be made by a responsible agent of the  
State of Michigan or any of its political subdivisions or by a Safety Inspector from the applicable  
Insurance Carrier.  
(b) Employer shall furnish a safety hat for each employee and a new winter liner when required.  
Hats and liners are to be returned to Employer upon lay-off or discharge.  
6. Drug Usage. In the interest of safety: intoxication, possession, consumption or use of  
alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs is not permitted on jobsites or while driving a company  
vehicle. The Union agrees to abide by the substance abuse program approved by the  
labor-management committee known as Management and Unions Serving Together (M.U.S.T.),  
adopted on February 25, 1992, or any other M.U.S.T. agreement jointly amended.  
   
7. The Employer shall furnish all power equipment and battery-operated tools. All Employer  
trucks, power saws, power tools, ladders, etc., are to be permanently and adequately marked or  
identified to indicate they are the property of the Employer. Magnetic signs on trucks shall not be  
considered permanent and are not acceptable.  
8. The Employer agrees that employees shall be allowed time to sharpen their personal tools.  
9. The Employer agrees to furnish suitable wearing apparel such as pullover boots and raincoats  
on all jobs where employees are required to work in inclement weather or under extremely wet  
or muddy conditions.  
10. Jobsite Injury. An employee, who as a result of a disabling on-the-job injury is unable to  
complete a full day's work, shall nevertheless be paid for the full day on which such injury  
occurred. The Employer shall mail a copy of Claim Form F-100 to employee within ten (10)  
calendar days of the injury. The Steward or an Employer representative shall accompany injured  
employee to the hospital. The Employer shall make arrangements for an injured employee's  
transportation from the hospital to his automobile, to the jobsite, or to his home as may be  
appropriate under the circumstances.  
11. Vacation. An employee shall be allowed to take an annual vacation upon two weeks notice  
to the Employer. If the employee is laid off during the vacation, the employee shall receive a  
lack of work slip and final paycheck.  
12. The supervision will be encouraged to call in job starts to the Union.  
13. Maintenance work may be performed under the current provisions of the “General  
Presidents' Project Agreement for Maintenance by Contract”, initially developed by the General  
President's Committee in September 1956. The parties to this Agreement will meet to negotiate a  
Maintenance Agreement applicable within the geographic jurisdiction of this Agreement.  
14. Safety Training: Effective June 1, 2001, each employee covered by this Agreement shall  
be required to carry a valid first aid training card and scaffold user training card, and shall attend  
on their own time, any classes or training necessary to maintain this requirement. The Union  
shall make every effort to provide these classes on a regular basis.  
15. Journeymen Upgrade Training. The union and management recognize the importance of  
journeyman training and upgrade training for all employees, and agrees to fully cooperate with  
Employers in their concerted effort to provide a highly skilled workforce within which to  
compete in the market place.  
The Union and Employer agree to promote and expect a minimum of 16 hours of instruction per  
calendar year of upgrade training. The JATC, with input from the Labor Management Forum  
Group, will determine the classes that qualify for this upgrade training.  
16. Labor/Management Forum. There is hereby established a Labor/Management Forum,  
which shall be comprised of an equal number representing the Union and the Association, for the  
purpose of reviewing on a quarterly basis (or as needed) basic problems, market share  
discussions, and/or issues confronting the industry and developing resolutions for same.  
   
   
   
In addition, the Labor/Management Forum will meet at least 90 days prior to the effective date of  
the negotiated future increase to review the financial status of the respective fringe benefit funds  
and make recommendations to the various fringe fund trustees on allocation and benefit plan  
revisions.  
17. Market Recovery. It is recognized by the parties that in certain areas of the state, the Union  
construction market has been threatened by non-union competition. Where the mutual interests  
of the Union and the Associations are served by cooperating to enable Association Contractor  
members to compete more effectively, it is agreed that the Labor/Management Forum (refer to  
Article III, Section 16) will meet to negotiate a market recovery rate and/or terms and conditions  
on a job by job or on an area basis. The Labor/Management Forum will meet periodically, but  
not less than twice annually, to discuss any problems with the market recovery system. The  
Union shall provide notification to the Associations of all market recovery rates within 48 hours  
upon written request.  

### ARTICLE IV  
### Equal Treatment  
### 
1. The Union shall not knowingly permit its members to work for any Employer who does not  
have an Agreement with the Union.  
2. If during the term of this Agreement, the Union has a collective bargaining agreement with  
any other Employer engaged in construction work within the geographic jurisdiction of this  
Agreement as done by the Employers that contains terms and conditions more favorable than  
those contained herein, the Union agrees that such more favorable terms or conditions shall  
automatically become a part of this Agreement replacing those herein which are less favorable.  
In addition, the Union shall notify and provide the Associations with a copy of any Agreements  
within 48 hours upon written request.  
3. Should an Employer covered by this Agreement engage in any work within the geographic  
jurisdiction of this Agreement (including specialty work and/or home building work) covered by  
other current existing agreements between the Union and other Employers engaged in that work,  
then that Employer shall be required to comply with such Agreement covering such work. If  
there is a question on the status of any Employer such question shall be submitted to the Joint  
Settlement Board for determination.  

### ARTICLE V  
### Subcontracting  
### 
1. The Employer agrees that he will not enter into subcontracts for work covered by this  
Agreement to be done at the site of the construction, alteration, or repair of a building, structure,  
or other work with any contractor who does not have a signed agreement with the Union;  
provided however, that where there is any dispute over work jurisdiction or assignment of work,  
such dispute shall be governed by Article I, hereof.  
2. The provisions of this Agreement specifically prohibit the use of labor contractors who as a  
subcontractor furnish workers to perform jobsite work covered by this Agreement, except where  
the labor contractor is signatory to this Agreement.  
   
   
   

### ARTICLE VI  
### Foreman  
### 
1. The foreman shall be selected by and be the representative of the Employer. He shall not be  
required to violate any part of this Agreement as a condition of employment. When three (3) or  
more members of the Union are employed, one (1) shall act as working foreman and receive the  
foreman's rate of pay.  
2. Any Carpenter employed in a supervisory capacity and required to act in a dual capacity of  
Carpenter Foreman and Superintendent will be covered under terms of this Agreement.  

### ARTICLE VII  
### Apprentices  
### 
1. The use of apprentices shall be encouraged under mutually agreeable indentureship rules and  
Detroit Carpentry Apprenticeship and Training Standards. The Employer agrees to abide by the  
rules, regulations and actions of the Detroit Carpentry Joint Apprenticeship and Training  
Committee (JATC) in the employment of apprentices. The Employer and Union agree that it is  
their practical responsibility, in an effort to better the industry, to promote the apprenticeship and  
training program.  
(a) Based on total employment, suitably distributed, the Employer shall employ apprentices in a  
ratio of one (1) apprentice to each five (5) journeymen. If an Employer is found to be employing  
apprentices in a ratio of less than one (1) to five (5), he shall be given notice to procure  
apprentices in the proper ratio within fourteen (14) working days. Any employee that comes  
through the Helmets to Hard Hats program will be recognized as an Apprentice for the purposes  
of calculating the Apprentice/Journeyman ratio. Apprentices shall operate under the rules of the  
Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee at all times.  
2. Payment for School Day. The Employer shall pay the Apprentice for attending classes on a  
regular attendance day, a sum equal to a full day's pay; however, should the Apprentice absent  
himself from the job, 10% per day missed will be deducted from payment for school day. Days  
missed due to weather or other acts by the Employer out of the Apprentice's control will not  
penalize that Apprentice for the 10% pay for each day falling in this category. Payment for  
school day may in no instance be less than the established scale, but shall be the actual wage the  
Apprentice is currently receiving. Hours spent in related classroom instruction shall not be  
considered as hours of work for the purpose of computing overtime.  
(a) The Apprentice attends school one day every two weeks. Five percent (5%) of the  
Apprentices' wage rate is included in all classification percentages for the payment of tuition.  
(b) An accepted applicant may be permitted employment on the jobsite seven (7) days prior to  
enrollment into the school or assignment of a school day, providing all other qualifications have  
been met. Such seven (7) days or part thereof shall constitute credit towards the 90 days  
probationary period.  
(c) It is mutually agreed that there will be periodic meetings of interested parties who will study  
the apprenticeship program with the purpose in mind of updating and streamlining the program.  
   
   
3. Apprentice Candidate Program. The Apprentice Candidate Program shall continue through  
the duration of this Agreement.  
4. Detroit Step Program. The Union (together with the Associations) will recommend that the  
appropriate JATC(s) provide the necessary Detroit Step information to the Association.  
5. Training. OSHA 30, ICRA Training, CPR/First-Aid, Scaffold, all Training — including  
current annual drug test and modules — must be current at time of graduation. All refresher  
courses should also be current/updated upon graduation. The Union, together with the  
Associations, will recommend to the Statewide Apprenticeship Fund and the JATCs to use their  
best efforts to incorporate this training into the Apprenticeship curriculum.  

### ARTICLE  
### Hours of Work  
### 
1. Day Shift. Eight (8) hours shall constitute a day’s work between the hours of 7:00 a.m.

between the Employer and the Union prior to the start of the job.  
2. Flex Time Workweek Monday through Friday. Straight-time shall be paid for work up  
to 10 hours per day or 40 hours per week Monday through Friday, with Monday as the starting  
day of the workweek (regardless of when the Employer’s payroll week begins). One and one-  
half (1%) the straight-time rate will apply after 10 hours per day or 40 hours per week, Monday  
through Friday. Saturdays may not be used as a make-up day. One and one-half (1%) the  
straight-time rate applies to all Saturday hours and those over 40 per week. Double-time applies  
on Sundays, Holidays and all time over 12 hours per day.  
3. Shift Work. All shift work shall be on a two (2) day basis regardless of the days on which  
worked.  
(a) When one (1) or two (2) shifts are employed, regardless of whether the day shift is worked,  
each shift shall work eight (8) hours before the overtime applies.  
(b) When three (3) shifts are employed, the first shift shall work eight (8) hours, the second  
shift shall work seven and one-half (7%) hours, and the third shift shall work seven (7) hours  
before the overtime rate applies.  
c) Shift work between the hours of 8:00 a.m. Monday and 8:00 a.m. Saturday shall be paid for  
at the regular shift rates as scheduled in Article IX. Shift work between the hours of 8:00 a.m.  
Saturday and 8:00 a.m. Monday shall be paid for at double the regular shift rates as scheduled in  
Article IX, with the exception that eight (8) hours of shift work may be performed between 8:00  
a.m. Saturday and 8:00 a.m. Sunday for one and one-half the straight time rate.  
(d) Employers shall have the right to designate shift hours and shall notify the Union of the start  
of such shifts within twenty-four (24) hours after start of shift work, except on weekends when  
notice shall be given Monday morning. Failure to notify as agreed, all the time worked shall be  
at double time. No employee covered by this Agreement shall knowingly be allowed to work two  
(2) consecutive shifts.  
   
   
   
(ec) It is understood that in the event job circumstances beyond the control of the Employer  
arise, the Employer and the Union will meet to arrange special shift provisions.  
4. Lunch Period. There shall be a lunch period at the end of the first four (4) hours of work on  
any shift. In the case of a flexible starting time, the period may be extended to a maximum of  
five hours. However, if job circumstances require the employee to work during the usual lunch  
period and take his unpaid lunch period at some other time, then the work performed during the  
usual lunch period shall be paid for at time and one-half (1’4). If an employee is requested to  
work more than twelve (12) hours, a lunch period of one-half (2) hour shall be allowed at the  
start of the thirteenth (13th) hour.  
(a) When any employee works through his normal lunch period, he shall be given his lunch  
period without unreasonable delay based on job conditions at the completion of his normal lunch  
period. If the employee is not relieved, he shall be paid at time and one-half (1/2) from the  
completion of his normal lunch period until relieved. All Carpenters shall have a full one-half  
(4) hour lunch period.  
5. Holidays. The holidays or days so celebrated, recognized by this Agreement and calling for  
double time for any work performed are: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July,  
Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and Labor Day. No work shall be done on Labor Day except  
for protection of life or property. If any of the above holidays fall on Sunday, the following  
Monday shall be considered the holiday and if work is performed the rate shall be double time.  
(a) If a holiday is celebrated on Friday or Monday, four 10-hour straight-time weekdays may be  
worked during the calendar week in which a holiday is celebrated to enable Carpenters to have a  
3-day weekend. In addition, the Employer may choose to work four 10-hour, straight-time  
weekdays during the week preceding or following this holiday week, to enable Carpenters to  
have a 4-day weekend. Jobs which have worked overtime on a regular basis within two weeks of  
the holiday may not change the workweek in accordance with this Paragraph. Notice must be  
given to the Union at least 5 work days before the first 4-10 day is worked.  
6. Travel. When an employee agrees to be sent out of the territorial jurisdiction of the Union by  
the Employer he shall receive all authorized expenses and either the scale or wages in the locality  
or in this Agreement.  
7. Coffee Break. Where all crafts employed on the job site agree, the following coffee break  
schedule shall apply. Each employee shall be allowed to take a 20-minute coffee break near  
their workstation during the first four (4) hour work period. If an employee is requested to work  
10 (ten) hours or more, an additional 10-minute coffee break shall be provided during the ninth  
hour of work time for all employees. During the time period of June 1* through August 31%)  
Carpenters working on outdoor projects only may be permitted a ten (10) minute coffee break  
near their work station during the first four (4) hour work period and once during the second four  
(4) hour work period. The specific times of all breaks shall be determined by the Employer and  
need not be at the same time for all employees. This Coffee Break schedule shall only apply to  
the Carpenters if all other crafts employed on the job site agree to this beverage break schedule.  
   
   
   
   

### ARTICLE IX  
### Wages and Fringe Benefit Contributions  
### 
The gross wage shown in these schedules includes required payments for Wages, Insurance,  
Pension and Dues Assessment contributions. Failure to pay the Base Wage and the funded fringe  
benefit contributions when due is payment of less than the Gross Wage and shall constitute a  
status of delinquency and a violation of this Agreement. The Union shall withhold its members  
from Employers who are thus in violation: In the event any Employer is delinquent in the  
payment of Wages or his contributions to the Insurance, Pension, Apprenticeship, Dues  
Assessment or Labor-Management Productivity and Training Funds, the Union, after giving the  
Employer and the Association twenty-four (24) hours notice (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and  
Holidays) by certified mail or telegram, of such delinquency, shall have the right to take strike  
action against such Employer, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement.  
1. The minimum rate of wages for Foremen, Journeymen, and Apprentice Carpenters shall be  
defined as follows for all geographic areas of this Agreement (formerly Zones | and 2):  
The geographic territory governed by this Agreement consists of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb,

### ARTICLE X  
### Guaranty Fund/Security Deposit  
### 
1. The parties have heretofore entered into an Agreement and Declaration of Trust establishing  
the Carpenters Guaranty Fund, hereinafter called the Guaranty Fund, administered by a joint  
Committee of an equal number of Union Representatives and Representatives appointed by the  
various Associations. The Guaranty Fund shall receive the deposits required hereunder and hold,  
administer and disperse the same as provided in the trust agreement.  
2. Each Employer covered by the terms of an Agreement with the Union will: (a) deposit and  
maintain with the Guaranty Fund such sum of money as shown in Paragraph 13 of Article X  
which shall operate as a security deposit under the terms and conditions of the Agreement, or (b)  
post a surety bond in such amount, issued by a bonding company licensed to do business in the  
State of Michigan, in a form acceptable to the Fringe Benefit Funds. As long as the Association  
represents the Employer, the guarantee of the Association that acts as its surety, as hereinafter  
provided shall be in lieu of a deposit or surety bond required by an individual Employer.  
3. Each Association may stand surety for the Employers it represents in the amount of $25,000  
for its Members who are Employers in Good Standing and $50,000 for its Members who are  
New Employers or Delinquent Employers or provide a suitable bond in lieu thereof. Subject to  
the restrictions and limitations provided herein the security deposit shall be used to cover claims  
against fringe benefit funds, and (b) for up to two (2) weeks of uncollected wages paid by checks  
not honored by the bank on which drawn. The total liability shall not exceed the Security  
Deposit or surety bond, subject to the restrictions and limitations provided herein.  
(a) Each Association shall advise the Union and the Guaranty Fund in writing of the names,  
addresses and classifications of its members not covered by the security deposit of the  
Association. Such Employer shall then be treated as a non-associated Employer for purposes for  
this Article.  
(b) If the coverage of any Employer is terminated by such notice, the guarantee of the  
Association shall nevertheless be liable for any claim against such Employer for delinquent  
payments accruing prior to such notice and for a period of two (2) weeks following the receipt of  
such notice, but in no event in excess of the maximum amount referred to in Paragraph 5 below.  
(c) The Association shall be notified promptly by the Union or the administrators of the various  
fringe benefit funds of the delinquency of any Employer who is covered by the deposit of the  
Association.  
20  
   
   
   
4. To the extent provided herein, the principal amount of the security deposit or surety bond of  
an individual Employer who is a member of the Association shall secure and guarantee payment  
of such individual Employer's obligations as described in Paragraph 3 immediately above, but  
shall not be used to defray the obligations of any other Employer. The obligations of such  
Employer to the various fringe benefit funds shall be deemed to include interest and cost of  
collection charges assessed by the said funds for late payment. The foregoing shall not apply to  
any Guaranty Fund hourly contributions due hereunder.  
5. The total amount of all claims by the various fringe benefit funds for delinquent payments  
that may be asserted against the security deposit for any one Employer shall be limited to the  
amount accrued, and in no event shall exceed the amount shown in Section 13 for the  
classification of the delinquent Employer.  
6. A statement of delinquency certified by the Administrator of any fringe benefit fund must be  
based upon an audit, admission of liability or refusal to allow an audit and shall be required  
before payment from the security deposit may be made by the Guaranty Fund. Payment by the  
Guaranty Fund shall be made immediately upon any one of the aforesaid requirements.  
7. No claims may be asserted and paid from security deposits made hereunder for any  
obligations of Employers accruing prior to June 15, 1970.  
8. This security deposit or surety bond shall continue for the term of this Agreement, as  
extended from time to time.  
9. Each Employer covered by the terms of this Agreement shall, at the end of each pay period,  
and not later than 4:30 p.m. on Friday of the pay week, make payment by cashier's or certified  
check to the Administrator's office of the fringe benefit funds of a sum equal to the fringe  
benefits owing for that pay period. The Employer shall submit reporting forms as otherwise  
required by the Trustees of the Fringe Benefit Funds.  
10. In the event any Employer is delinquent at the end of a pay period in the payment of wages  
or in contributions to the fringe benefit funds provided in Paragraph 9 above, the employees or  
their representatives shall take such action as necessary, forthwith, to collect such delinquent  
payments, and it is further agreed that in the event any such action is taken, the Employer shall  
be responsible to the employees for all losses resulting therefrom, including loss of wages.  
11. The provisions of Paragraphs 9 and 10 above shall not apply to any Employer who elects to  
make a security deposit or post a surety bond, as set forth below with the Guaranty Fund or any  
Employer covered by the undertaking of an Association, and such Employer shall continue to  
make payments monthly to the depository of the fringe benefit funds as prescribed by current  
rules and regulations.  
12. Notwithstanding any other provision in Article X to the contrary, the Trustees of the fringe  
benefit funds may require any Employer who has been frequently delinquent in making such  
contributions, as certified by the Administrator of any fringe benefit fund, or whose current  
payroll exceeds his classification, to comply with the provisions of Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this  
Article X.  
a1  
   
   
   
13. Employers for whom the Association does not stand surety shall comply with the following:  
(a) An Employer in Good Standing not later than December 31 of each year shall submit to the  
Trustees of the Guaranty Fund a sworn affidavit stating the average number of Carpenters on  
the Employer's payroll during the twenty-six week period from May 1 through October 31 of  
the preceding calendar year and showing a computation made by taking the highest number of  
Carpenters employed on any one day for each week during the period and dividing the total by  
the number of weeks during which Carpenters were on the payroll. The security deposit or  
surety bond amount required from each Employer in Good Standing corresponding to the  
average number of carpenters employed shall be as follows:  
Classification Average Number Deposit  
of Employer of Carpenters Amount  
A 1-5 $25,000.00  
B 6-10 $50,000.00  
C 11-15 $75,000.00  
D 16 or more $100,000.00  
In the alternative, such Employer shall make the $.10 per hour contribution in  
accordance with Section 13(b)(ii).  
(b) A New Employer or a Delinquent Employer shall have the option of either:  
1) Posting a $100,000.00 security deposit or surety bond with the Carpenters Guaranty  
Fund; or,  
2) (i) Paying its fringe benefit contributions on a weekly or monthly basis as required by  
the Detroit Carpenters' Fringe Benefit Funds’ Joint Delinquency Committee, and  
(ii) Contributing $.10 to the Carpenters Guaranty Fund for each hour worked by all  
employees covered by this Agreement. The Guaranty Fund contribution shall be made  
together with all other Fringe Benefit Fund payments. The hourly contributions made  
under this Subparagraph (b)(ii) to the Guaranty Fund shall be paid in addition to any  
existing security deposit posted by the Employer. If an Employer posts a security  
deposit or surety bond, or joins an Association that stands as its surety, after having paid  
the aforesaid hourly contributions, any such payments made prior to such posting shall  
not be refundable to the Employer.  
(c) A New Employer is defined as an Employer who has been making fringe benefit  
contributions to the Funds for less than two (2) years. A Delinquent Employer is defined as an  
Employer who during the preceding consecutive twelve (12) month period has failed to make  
timely payment of any amounts due the Funds hereunder. An Employer in Good Standing is  
defined as an Employer who is neither a New Employer nor a Delinquent Employer. The Detroit  
Carpenters’ Fringe Benefit Funds’ Joint Delinquency Committee has authority to waive the  
delinquent status of an Employer when the status was the result of errors in payment of  
insignificant amounts, brief delays in payment, or errors due to unintentional clerical mistakes. A  
New Employer or a Delinquent Employer who becomes an Employer in Good Standing may  
request a refund of his deposit to the extent it is in excess of the deposit required of him as an  
Employer in Good Standing.

### ARTICLE XI  
### Pay Day  
### 
1. Friday shall be the weekly pay day on all work, except where a State, Federal, or local law or  
regulation makes it impracticable. Each employee shall be paid weekly and during working  
hours. Employers may pay employees by Direct Deposit for hours worked, including overtime.  
The Employer shall provide a paper copy of a check stub to any employee who requests it.  
Employees shall receive a stub or memorandum indicating the dates of the pay period, the gross  
amount of the check, F.I.C.A. and income tax withheld; the Employer's name, address, hours  
worked and the employee's name. No more than one week's pay shall be held back.  
2. Employer shall furnish with an employee's final paycheck a statement giving the Employer's  
Michigan Employment Security Agency (M.E.S.A.) Number.  
3. A statement showing the total amount of insurance and pension contributions paid, or to be

least once a month. If an employee is employed less than one (1) month, the statement shall be  
furnished him at time of termination of employment.  
4. The Employer shall give any employee who is laid off or discharged, not less than one (1)  
hour's notice of the lay off or the discharge. On an extremely large job, or jobs within a large  
industrial plant requiring check out of tools, one and one-half (2) hours' notice shall be given. An  
Employee who is laid off or discharged shall be paid off in full on the job and given a separation  
slip stating the reason for such action. A temporary work stoppage for reasons other than weather  
and not exceeding one work day will not be considered a lay off. In the event a laid off or  
discharged employee is not paid at the time set forth above, his pay-off check shall be mailed to  
the employee by certified mail (no return receipt requested) before the end of the next business  
day. If the pay check is not mailed before the end of the next business day, the employee shall be  
paid an additional two (2) hours pay for each twenty-four (24) hours of delay retroactive to the  
day of lay-off. Note: Regarding layoff and discharge, see Article XII], Section 4.  
5. When weather does not permit work to start on pay day, pay checks shall be issued between  
the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. In case issuance of pay checks is not started until after 9:00  
a.m., each employee who has waited from 8:00 a.m. for his check shall be paid for a minimum of  
waiting time of one and one-half (%) hours, from 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. If the checks are not  
distributed at 9:30 a.m. waiting time shall be paid for by the Employer in one-half (2) hour  
intervals, but not to exceed the end of a normal working day. The Employer shall not be  
obligated to pay for waiting time if he or his representative appears on the job with pay checks  
for issuance any time between the hours of 8:00 am. and 9:00 a.m., nor shall he or his  
representative be required to remain on the job longer than to issue checks or arrange for the  
issuance of checks.  
6. If paychecks are not issued by the end of the regular day's work or regular shift work on  
payday, the employee shall be paid an additional hour's pay, at straight time, for each hour he is  
required to wait for his check, up to a maximum additional payment of eight (8) hours’ pay.  
Additional pay shall not be required if Employer was prevented from issuing checks by strikes,  
civil disorder, severe weather or other casualty beyond control of the Employer. Direct Deposit  
shall be allowed on a company wide basis in accordance with all provisions as stated previously  
in relation to payday and lay off. Pay stubs will be mailed no later than the next business day.

not put to work, or when regular employees report on any job and are not put to work, weather  
permitting, they shall be paid not less than two (2) hours' pay for so reporting. No Carpenter shall  
be allowed to stay on the job beyond the first hour unless they are on the payroll of the  
Employer. Should a Carpenter report late to the jobsite, his reporting pay shall be reduced by a  
deductible for such late reporting.  
2. Show-Up Pay: Carpenters sent from the office of the Union to a jobsite where M.U.S.T.  
certification is required by the owner employing the contractor must demonstrate they have the  
requisite M.U.S.T. Safety Program certification as required by the owner. All employees must  
be current with the M.U.S.T. Drug and Alcohol Screening Program, or its successor, and must  
have successfully completed the requisite M.U.S.T. Safety Program training modules to be  
eligible for show-up time pay. The contractor is required to provide the Union with the required  
specifications signed and authorized via facsimile or mail at least 24 hours prior to the request  
for Employees for such job.  
3. On projects where work cannot start due to weather, the following method of payment for  
show-up time shall apply:  
At Start of Normal Shift:  
The employee shall receive two (2) hours' show-up time regardless of weather at the applicable  
shift rate. During these two (2) hours the employee must stay on the jobsite unless excused by  
the Employer. On Saturdays all show-up time is paid at time and one-half the applicable shift  
rate, and on Sundays and holidays at double the applicable shift rate.  
If Work Starts During the Said Two Hours:  
Carpenters who start to work shall receive pay at the applicable shift rate as though they  
commenced work at the start of the shift, plus any time worked beyond the first two hours.  
If a Partial Crew of Carpenters is Requested to Report Before Their Normal Shift Hours:  
They shall remain on the job for early start hours, plus two (2) hours into their normal shift.  
They shall receive one (1) hour's pay at the applicable rate for each hour until their normal shift  
starting time; and shall remain on the job for the first two (2) hours of their normal shift for  
which they shall receive two (2) hours’ pay at the applicable shift rate.  
4. M.U.S.T. Safety Program. The parties agreed to establish a task force consisting of  
representatives from each of the parties signatory to this settlement to develop new guidelines

Program training modules in an expeditious manner.  

### ARTICLE XUI  
### Steward  
### 
1. A Steward shall be selected on all jobs from the employees on the job, if practical. A steward  
should be first aid and scaffold user trained. A representative of the Union shall have the right to  
visit the job during working hours to interview the Employer, steward, or workers, but in no way  
hinder the progress of the work.  
24

working, who shall report any violation of the Agreement, and perform the usual duties of the  
steward with the least interference to the job.  
3. The steward shall call the foreman's attention to any unsafe equipment or unsafe working  
conditions. If the foreman and the steward cannot agree on what is unsafe equipment or unsafe  
working conditions, or if having agreed, action to correct same is not taken by the foreman, the  
steward must make a report to the Union. The Employer and the Union will then send  
representatives to the job to observe conditions and agree on corrective measures to be taken.  
4. The Employer or his agents shall not lay off, discharge, or transfer a Carpenter steward, so  
acting on any job, until the matter has been discussed with representatives of the Union.  
(a) When a job is reactivated after having been temporarily shut down, the Steward shall be the  
first man recalled after the Foreman. Both the Steward and the Union Business Agent shall be  
notified of job reactivation by telephone, telegram, or registered mail.  
5. The Employer shall permit the steward a reasonable amount of time to record the hours  
worked by the Carpenters on the job and will cooperate with the steward in the procurement of  
time data. Any new employees shall be referred to the steward before starting to work to be  
added to the rolls. Before any employee is to be laid off or discharged, the steward shall be  
notified prior to such layoff or discharge.  
6. The Executive Secretary of the Union or his representative will place a steward on the jobs of  
an Employer in the following circumstances:  
a) When an Employer pays fringe benefits on a weekly basis;  
b) When an Employer intentionally fails to pay the correct base wage; or  
c) When an Employer becomes more than thirty (30) days delinquent in the payment of  
monthly fringe benefit contributions, by either failing to accurately report hours worked, by  
paying less than the correct contribution rate, or by otherwise not paying the complete  
amount when due.  
d) Failure to call in job start within 72 hours of beginning work.  
When an Employer has intentionally failed to pay the correct base wage, a steward will be placed  
on all of the Employer's current jobs and on all of the Employer's jobs starting within six (6)  
months of the latest occurrence. When an Employer has become more than thirty (30) days  
delinquent in the payment of fringe benefits, a steward will be placed on all of the Employer's  
current jobs and on all of the Employer's jobs starting while the delinquency exists. Stewards  
must be journeymen carpenters and have been members of the Union not less than two (2) years.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT  
CARPENTER BACK-TO-WORK PROGRAM  
A carpenter injured while working for an Employer may return to work for that Employer  
at a reduced scale of wages to perform a limited work scope, "Bridge Job," as approved  
in writing by the administrating physician. A Bridge Job is construction-related work  
which may or may not be within the work jurisdiction of the Union. The scale of wages  
will be determined by the administrating physician's classification of the tasks to be  
performed commensurate with the capability of the carpenter. The work classifications  
are:  
Very Light Work: Lifting ten pounds maximum and occasionally lifting and/or  
carrying such articles as dockets, ledgers and small tools. Although a very light job is  
defined as one which involves sitting, walking and/or standing may often be necessary  
in carrying out job duties. The amount of walking and/or standing permissible will be  
determined by the extent to which the injured body part impairs the ability to walk  
and/or stand.  
Light Work: Lifting twenty pounds maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying of  
objects weighing up to ten pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be only a  
negligible amount, a job is in this category when it requires walking or standing to a  
significant degree or when it involves sitting with a moderate degree of pushing and  
pulling of arm and/or leg controls.  
Medium Work: Lifting fifty pounds maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying of  
objects weighing up to twenty-five pounds.  
The Base Wage for Very Light Work will be 30% of the Journeyman Base Wage. The  
Base Wage for Light Work will be 50% of the Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage  
for Medium Work will be 75% of the Journeyman Base Wage. For all work  
classifications, the Employer will pay the full dollar amount of fringe benefits received  
by a Carpenter Journeyman in addition to the applicable Base Wage. Compensation  
would increase as the carpenter progresses through the work classifications based on the  
physician's approval of the next level of physical demand.  
The Workers' Compensation insurance provider may pay an additional weekly amount to  
the employee as an added incentive to encourage his voluntary participation in the Back-  
to-Work Program. This amount, if any, will be determined based on the formula as  
provided for by the workers' compensation guidelines. Refusal of a reasonable offer of  
employment may jeopardize the continued collection of benefits in accordance with State  
law.  
A carpenter's employment under the Back-to-Work Program is limited to a maximum of  
six months for each incident. Implementation of the Program is discretionary on behalf of  
the Employer, and is subject to the availability of Bridge Jobs. Upon release for work by  
the administrating physician, the carpenter would return to full wages and be placed in  
available work.
