The Association signatory hereto recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective  \nbargaining agent for a majority of all persons employed as Carpenters in the geographical area  \ncoming within the jurisdiction of the Union; and  \nThe Union recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for  \nits members, the majority of contractors engaged in commercial, industrial, institutional and  \nheavy construction work, for the purpose of collective bargaining in the geographical area  \ncoming within the jurisdiction of the Union.  \n2.

The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they are subject to state and federal law and  \nmunicipal ordinances regarding equal employment opportunity and fair employment practices  \nand therefore will jointly take the necessary steps to comply with these laws and ordinances  \nwithin the scope of this Agreement.

Payment for  \nschool day may in no instance be less than the established scale, but shall be the actual wage the  \nApprentice is currently receiving. Hours spent in related classroom instruction shall not be  \nconsidered as hours of work for the purpose of computing overtime.  \n(a) The Apprentice attends school one day every two weeks. Five percent (5%) of the  \nApprentices' wage rate is included in all classification percentages for the payment of tuition.  \n(b) An accepted applicant may be permitted employment on the jobsite seven (7) days prior to  \nenrollment into the school or assignment of a school day, providing all other qualifications have  \nbeen met.

That amount shall be the aggregate of all benefits  \ncalculated in accordance with the Pension Fund\u2019s Plan in excess of the payment permitted under  \nSection 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, increased to reflect FICA, FUTA and any other  \nsimilar taxes applicable thereto, together with any administrative expenses.

The present schedule of collection charges for late  \ncontributions requires a payment of five percent (5%) on all contributions received between one  \nand fifteen days after the due date and a payment of ten percent (10%) on all contributions  \nreceived more than fifteen days after the due date. An additional two percent (2%) per month  \nassessment will be imposed on contributions received more than sixty days late.  \n19  \n   \n12. Dues Deduction.

The work classifications  \nare:  \nVery Light Work: Lifting ten pounds maximum and occasionally lifting and/or  \ncarrying such articles as dockets, ledgers and small tools. Although a very light job is  \ndefined as one which involves sitting, walking and/or standing may often be necessary  \nin carrying out job duties. The amount of walking and/or standing permissible will be  \ndetermined by the extent to which the injured body part impairs the ability to walk  \nand/or stand.  \nLight Work: Lifting twenty pounds maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying of  \nobjects weighing up to ten pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be only a  \nnegligible amount, a job is in this category when it requires walking or standing to a  \nsignificant degree or when it involves sitting with a moderate degree of pushing and  \npulling of arm and/or leg controls.  \nMedium Work: Lifting fifty pounds maximum with frequent lifting and/or carrying of  \nobjects weighing up to twenty-five pounds.  \nThe Base Wage for Very Light Work will be 30% of the Journeyman Base Wage. The  \nBase Wage for Light Work will be 50% of the Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage  \nfor Medium Work will be 75% of the Journeyman Base Wage. For all work  \nclassifications, the Employer will pay the full dollar amount of fringe benefits received  \nby a Carpenter Journeyman in addition to the applicable Base Wage. Compensation  \nwould increase as the carpenter progresses through the work classifications based on the  \nphysician's approval of the next level of physical demand.  \nThe Workers' Compensation insurance provider may pay an additional weekly amount to  \nthe employee as an added incentive to encourage his voluntary participation in the Back-  \nto-Work Program. This amount, if any, will be determined based on the formula as  \nprovided for by the workers' compensation guidelines. Refusal of a reasonable offer of  \nemployment may jeopardize the continued collection of benefits in accordance with State  \nlaw.  \nA carpenter's employment under the Back-to-Work Program is limited to a maximum of  \nsix months for each incident. Implementation of the Program is discretionary on behalf of  \nthe Employer, and is subject to the availability of Bridge Jobs. Upon release for work by  \nthe administrating physician, the carpenter would return to full wages and be placed in  \navailable work.  \n29  \n   \n   \n   \nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed  \nby their respective proper offices, duly authorized this Ist day of June, 2019.  \nSeat \"Ys  \nAGC of MICHIGAN  \nScott Pantaleo, Director of Labor Relations  \n     \nMICHIGAN REGIONAL COUNCINOF CARPENTERS  \nThomas D.
