Such  \nAGC/Teamster MLA 2002-2007 Page 6  \nworkers shall be cleared and dispatched from the Local Union. Thereafter all other workers shall be  \nreferred from the Loca! Union.  \n6.11.b. On projects requiring more than twenty-five (25) consecutive workdays of Teamster  \nwork, the Contractor will state at the pre-job conference the number of workers whom he desires to  \nbring into the area, and an attempt will be made to reach a mutual understanding on the matter and any  \nsuch understanding shall be reduced to writing. After the agreed number has been brought in, all  \nadditional workers will be referred from the Local Union. If no agreement is reached, then that fact  \nshall be reduced to writing. In the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement the Contractor  \nmay bring in workers under one of the following options:  \n(1) The Contractor will be allowed to bring in any worker on his payroll during the  \ntwelve (12) months preceding the pre-job conference up to a maximum of forty percent (40%) of the  \nwork force, provided that the ratio of workers shall be maintained at sixty percent (60%) from the  \nLocal Union and forty percent (40%) brought into the area by the Contractor. All workers requested  \nunder this option shall be cleared and dispatched by the Local Union subject to the ratio prescribed  \nabove. This option shall not be applied to workers from outside the territory of this Agreement.  \n(2) The Contractor may bring in a worker as the first to be employed on the  \nproject. The next three (3) workers shall be referred from the Local Union pursuant to the provisions  \nof this Article. This procedure shall be repeated as additional workers are required, provided that the  \nratio of workers employed on the project shall be maintained at three (3) workers referred by the Union  \nand one (1) brought in by the Contractor.  \n(3) For asphaltic concrete surfacing operations, the Contractor shall be entitled to  \nbring in any workers on his payroll continuously except for normal and seasonal layoff due to  \ninclement weather or lack of work during the twelve (12) months preceding the pre-job conference up  \nto a maximum of 80 percent of the work force, provided that the ratio of workers shall not exceed  \neighty percent (80%) percent brought into the area by the Contractor. All workers requested under this  \nprovision shall be cleared and dispatched by the Local Union before performing any work on the  \nproject.  \n6.1 1.c. In the preceding Section 6.11.b. (including subparagraphs 1, 2, and 3), where workers  \nare to be referred from the local union, the Contractor may request, by name, fifty percent (50%) of  \nthose referrals from the local union's \"A\" list.  \n6.11.d. Any worker hired by the Contractor in violation of this Section shall be removed from  \nthe project by the Contractor within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of written notice from the  \nUnion specifying this subsection as the reason for such request. The Local Union shall dispatch a  \nreplacement employee. Such replacement shall report to the Contractor for work at such time as is  \nmutually agreed or twenty-four (24) hours from the Contractor's receipt of written notice of violation.  \nPayment of all wages, including overtime and all benefits to the replacement employee shall  \ncommence at the designated time for reporting to work. Such payment shall be for each hour worked  \nthat is in violation of this Section after said reporting time.  \n6.12.

The Local Union shall make every effort to furnish the Contractor with competent,  \nexperienced workers, and the Contractor shall determine the applicant's suitability for the job in a fair  \nand non-discriminatory manner. |  \n6.14. The Contractor and the Union recognize that a Contractor should not lose jobs because  \nof Government requirements, which are in conflict with the hiring hall. Therefore, when a government  \ncontract or Government Agency requires a different hiring hall arrangement to meet Federal or State  \nrequirements, the hiring hall arrangement will be modified to meet the demands of those  \nrequirements. It is understood that the hiring hal! will be followed as closely as possible without being  \nin conflict with the Government requirements.  \nThe Contractor will notify the Union in advance of the commencement of the job of the  \nGovernment requirements, and upon request will provide the Union with a copy of pertinent  \nprovisions.  \n| It is also further understood and agreed that this section is not intended to create jobs  \nwhere none exist.  \n6.15.
