If the supervisor determines the employee is fulfilling the total  \nresponsibilities of the absent job description, then such employee shall be given an interim appointment  \nto the absent position. Payment for such interim appointment shall begin on the 31st duty day of  \nperformance of the total responsibility of the job description of the absent person.  \nlf an employee disagrees with the determination of his/her immediate supervisor, such employee may request a  \nreview of such decision by the Superintendent. The Superintendent's decision in such cases shall be final and that  \ndecision is not subject to the grievance procedure.  \nTemporaries  \nThe supervisor shall make a determination as to whether a temporary is required in the case of a long-term  \nabsence of an employee.

Ongoing regular duties will not be  \narbitrarily changed, nor instituted without verbal notification.  \nNothing in a job description is intended or shall be construed so as to concede to an employee, or group of  \nemployees, the right to refuse to follow instructions or orders.  \nThe Board maintains total authority to change job descriptions in any manner it sees fit in order to best  \nmanage its affairs and to accomplish the mission of the Board.  \n10  \nThe employee shall be provided a revised copy of the new job description and, if necessary, be provided  \nopportunity and available training within a reasonable length of time to learn new skills to continue in the  \njob.  \nEmployees who allege they are regularly performing duties substantially divergent from those authorized in  \nofficial job descriptions shall meet with their supervisor to resolve the issue. In the event that a solution is  \nnot reached, the employee may request a second conference with their immediate supervisor and that  \nadministrator's supervisor. In the event that a solution is not reached, the employee may request a  \nconference with the Chief Personnel Officer. A complaint under this section is not subject to the grievance  \nprocedure.  \nJob Reclassification  \n(a)  \n(b)  \nAny employee, class of employees, or the Board, may make a request for job reclassification utilizing  \nprocedures established by the Superintendent, and the final decision shall be made by the Superintendent.  \nWhen an employee is advanced to a position in a higher classification level, the employee will be placed  \nwithin the appropriate classification level which will provide an hourly rate increase of five percent (5%), or  \nthe minimum hourly rate of the new classification level, whichever is greater.  \nWhen an employee is transferred from one position to another position in the same classification level, the  \nemployee\u2019s level/step shall remain the same.  \nIf an employee requests a change in position to a lower classification, and he/she has been employed in  \nthe present position for one full year of duty days or longer, the salary shall remain the same as long as the  \ncurrent salary is within the minimum and maximum of the salary level.  \nlf an employee requests a change to a lower classification, and he/she has not been employed in their  \npresent position for a minimum of a full year of duty days, there will be a reduction of five percent (5%) of  \ntheir annual salary. If employee\u2019s salary after the five percent (5%) reduction is not within the salary range  \nof the lower classification, the salary shall be adjusted to the maximum of the range for that  \nclassification.  \nlf an employee is reassigned into a lower classification level due to excess, reorganization or other imposed  \nchange, the employee\u2019s salary shall remain the same through the current fiscal year. However, if the salary  \nwas not within the range for the lower classification, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, the salary will  \nbe adjusted to the maximum of the range for that level.  \nlf an employee has been promoted to a higher level or job classification and has been in the position for  \nless than one full year of duty days and requests or is reassigned to the previous position or level held,  \nhe/she will be returned to the previous annual salary plus any raises that occurred in the interim.  \nAssignment to Temporary Duty Elsewhere  \n(a)  \nA bargaining unit member may be assigned temporarily to duties other than his/her regular duties and  \nplace of employment. Such assignment to temporary duty will ordinarily originate with the Superintendent.  \nAll requests for assignment of temporary duty outside the county shall be submitted to the Superintendent  \nat least ten (10) calendar days in advance. A member shall receive his/her regular pay and may be  \nallowed expenses as provided by law, regulation of the State Board of Education, and Board Policies.  \n11  \n10.  \n11.  \n12.  \n(b) Temporary duty within the District may be approved by the supervisor when no substitute service or other  \nadditional cost to the Board is involved.  \n(c) The supervisor authorizing such temporary duty shall be responsible to ascertain that the temporary duty  \nhas been performed. No temporary duty forms need to be submitted for this type of assignment.  \n(d) Such temporary duty shall be considered equal to the regular duties of the individual, and an employee  \nperforming such temporary duty shall not be considered on leave.  \n(e) It is understood that such leave is provided only when the temporary assignment is necessary to effectively  \ncarry out the mission of the District and that such leave is not provided for personal reasons of the member  \nor for Association business.  \nBreak in Service  \nEmployees who resign in good standing and are rehired within one (1) calendar year into a position in the same  \ngrade as the one previously held, may be rehired either at their former rate, grade and step, or the new minimum,  \nwhichever is higher. An employee who has been separated from the system for a period exceeding one (1) year  \nshall be treated as a new employee.  \nSeniority/Longevity Rights  \nseniority shall be defined as the total length of continuous service with the Board. Seniority shall be district wide  \nand shall date from the last effective date of employment. Time off for Board approved noncompensable leaves of  \nabsence shall count for seniority purposes and such leave shall not be considered as an interruption of service.  \nReduction-in-Force Policy  \nIn the event that a reduction in work force (RIF) becomes necessary due to declines in enrollment, budgetary  \nrestrictions, reorganization, or other causes as determined by the Board, the following reduction-in-work force  \nprovisions shall apply:  \n(a) The Board will determine the classification(s) and assignments within the classification(s) to be reduced.  \nThe Superintendent will notify the Association\u2019s President in advance of any pending reduction in work  \nforce action. When units are reduced, employees will be released in the inverse order of their length of  \ntime in the District within the classifications and assignment within the classification(s).  \n(b) In the event that two (2) or more employees affected have the same amount of continuous service within  \nthe District, the Superintendent or designee shall make the decision of who shall be retained.  \nRecall  \nWhen employees are recalled from layoff, the employee with the greatest seniority in the District shall be recalled  \nfirst. Employees in layoff status will retain recall rights for one year and shall have preference to work over  \napplicants on eligible lists. Recall will be made by certified mail to the last address in the records.  \nWithin five (5) workdays of the certified receipt date or attempted delivery, laid-off employees must signify in writing  \nto the Human Resources their intention of returning to work. Employees must return to their assigned work location  \nwithin five (5) workdays of acceptance of recall. If an employee fails to respond to a recall notice or declines an  \noffer, the next senior employee will be recalled. If an employee fails to respond or declines an offer three (3) times  \nhe/she will forfeit further recall rights.  \n12  \nIf several positions within a recalled classification become available for recall at one time, the Superintendent, when  \nrecalling employees, shall first place the employees in the school or department from which they were laid off if  \nsuch position is available. If such position is not available, then the Superintendent, when filling such positions,  \nshall consider affirmative action goals, geographic location, preference of the senior employee, and the needs of  \nthe District. However, the decision of the Superintendent shall be final. If an employee fails to accept an offer of  \nrecall, the employee forfeits all recall rights.  \nAny accrued sick leave of record at the time of layoff shall be restored at the time the employee is rehired. An  \nemployee who is on layoff status is eligible to apply for any other position, and if re-employed by the District, the  \nemployee forfeits rights to recall.  \nTerminal Pay Benefits  \n(a) An employee who retires and submits proof of eligibility from the Florida Retirement System or whose  \nemployment is terminated by death shall receive payment for accrued sick leave days. Such  \ncompensation shall be the daily rate of pay at retirement or death of the employee multiplied by the  \nmaximum percentage provided for by Florida Statute times the number of accumulated sick leave days. In  \nthe event service is terminated by death, benefits shall be paid to the beneficiary as identified on the  \nemployee's group life insurance form.  \n(b) Accrued Annual Leave: A member of the bargaining unit shall receive payment for all accrued vacation  \nleave (if applicable) at his/her daily rate at time of resignation or termination, retirement, or to his/her  \nbeneficiary, if service is terminated by death, as terminal leave pay. Resignation or termination shall be the  \nlast duty day an employee is physically on duty unless the employee is by necessity required to resign or  \nterminate while on sick leave.  \nPerformance-Based Termination/Suspension  \n(a) Any employee whose performance is deemed to be less than satisfactory by his/her supervisor shall be so  \nadvised in writing of such unsatisfactory performance by the supervisor.  \n(b) The employee will be provided assistance to improve his/her performance.  \n(c) No employee shall be recommended for termination/suspension based on an unsatisfactory evaluation  \nunless he/she has been given at least thirty (30) calendar days to improve his/her performance.  \n(d) An employee who will be recommended to the Board for termination/suspension shall be given notice, in  \nwriting, with documentation stating the reasons. The employee shall be given prior notice if the  \nSuperintendent is recommending termination/suspension prior to Board action.  \n(e) After Board action, an employee may, within fifteen (15) days, protest his/her performance-based  \ntermination/suspension through either the grievance procedure or the Department of Administration  \nHearings (DOAK).  \nEqual Employment Rights  \nThe parties to this Agreement agree that the provisions regarding such items as training, assignment, promotion,  \ntransfer, discipline or termination shall be applied without regard to race, creed, color, religion, national origin, age,  \ngender, disability, personal life style, domicile, marital status, sexual orientation, political affiliation or membership in  \n13  \nthe Association. Appeals of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act are not subject to the grievance  \nprocedure.  \nProbationary Employees  \n(a) All newly hired or rehired employees or promoted employees , excluding employees on recall status, shall  \nbe subject to a probationary period of ninety (90) work days.  \n(b) During the probationary period newly hired and re-hired employees may be discharged without recourse.  \n(c) When an employee is promoted to a higher classification, he/she shall be subject to a 90 calendar day  \nprobationary period in that position. During this promotional probationary period, the district will provide  \nwritten feedback to the employee regarding his/her conduct/performance. At any time during the  \npromotional probationary period, either the District or the employee can cancel the promotion for any or no  \nreason. The decision not to continue an employee in the promoted position and/or the written feedback  \nshall not be the subject of a grievance procedure. In the event the promoted employee does not continue  \nin the higher classified position for 90-days, he/she shall be given a position at the same level and with the  \nsame benefits he/she received prior to the promotion.  \n(d) Newly hired/re-hired probationary employees are not eligible to hold any union office or stewardship or to  \nauthorize membership dues deductions.  \n(e) Newly hired/re-hired probationary employees shall not be eligible for any type of leave except accrued sick  \nleave, annual leave, or short term unpaid leave (due to illness), not to exceed five (5) days.  \nSECTION C - PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE  \n1.  \nThis section covers actions involving verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspensions, demotions, dismissals, or  \nreductions in grade or pay with prejudice.  \nDisciplinary action may not be taken against an employee except for just cause and this must be substantiated by  \nsufficient evidence by the Superintendent or Designee which supports the recommended disciplinary action.  \nAll allegations pertaining to a disciplinary action shall be investigated. Actions under this Section shall be initiated  \nafter all the facts have been made known to the official responsible for taking the actions.  \nDisciplinary action shall be governed by applicable State Statutes.  \nAn employee against whom disciplinary action is to be taken may appeal said action through the grievance  \nprocedure, excluding verbal warning and written reprimand. An employee may not appeal an action through the  \ngrievance procedure, to PERC as an unfair labor practice complaint and to DOAH.

This amount of time is to be  \nmutually agreed upon by the parties.  \nPrevious charges or disciplinary actions that have been brought forth by the District may be cited against the  \nemployee if those previous acts are reasonably related to the existing charge. All previous charges or disciplinary  \nactions must have been shared with the employee.  \nThe discipline, dismissal, demotion, and suspension of any employee shall be for just cause.  \nWhere just cause warrants such action(s), an employee may be demoted, suspended or dismissed upon  \nrecommendation to the Superintendent.
