Because the furnishing of services by a Subcontractor who  \n   \n   \nhas not made the appropriate fringe benefit payments serves to undermine the standards of this Agreement  \nand to deprive employees who would otherwise be having fringe benefit contributions paid on their behalf of the  \nopportunity for employment, the Contractor agrees that it shall not subcontract any portion of his job to any  \nsuch Subcontractor.

The Contractor and the Union agree  \nthat such audits are expensive and time consuming for the Trust Funds and the Contractor, but the Trust  \nFunds otherwise have no way of knowing the full extent of the Contractor's obligations, since the records  \nshowing the related employment are in the possession and control of the Contractor. In order to minimize the  \nneed for and frequency of such audits, the Contractor agrees that the Trustees and the Union place trust and  \nconfidence in the Contractor to report and pay contributions properly. For these reasons, if an audit by the  \nTrust Funds discovers that the Contractor has failed to report and pay properly as required by this Agreement,  \nthe Trust Fund's right to sue for the Contractor\u2019s failure to pay shall begin to run from the date of the audit in  \nwhich the delinquent amounts are discovered.  \nAn Employer who refuses to permit an audit by authorized representatives of the Trust Funds shall be  \nconsidered delinquent to the Trust Funds, and shall he liable to the Trust Funds for all jegal costs, including -  \nattorney fees, incurred by the Trust Funds in obtaining the audit, regardless of whether the audit finds any  \ndelinquent contributions due.  \nAll signatory Employers who fail to send the monthly report form as required by the various Trust Funds  \nwhether any employees are employed or not, shall be considered delinquent to the Trust Funds.

A committee of not less than three (3) management representatives and three (3)  \nunion representatives appointed by the Training and Retraining Trust shall establish the protocol for the  \nCertification Examination and its revisions. Each member of the committee must have full knowledge of the  \nskills and necessary requirements for the crane operations that the examination (s) will cover.  \nThe address for testing shall he at the Operating Engineers and management's training site at 2190 Pellisier  \nPlace, Whittier. In addition, the testing site may he designated at an employer's place of business or some other  \nlocation designated by the management/union committee to give a test to all operators. Irrespective of the test  \nsite, testing is to be conducted by an independent and impartial testing organization. The independent and  \nimpartial testing organization will be selected from a list of at least five (5) candidates invited to offer proposals  \nand establish qualifications to the Committee. In the event one (1) candidate cannot be selected by mutual  \nagreement, the Committee will alternately strike names from the list until one (1) candidate remains. At the  \nend of one (1) year of service to the testing program or anyanniversary date thereafter, either the union or the  \nmanagement committee will have the unqualified right to terminate the current independent testing organiza-  \ntion and the entire selection process will be repeated. The cost associated with the testing is the sole responsi-  \nbility of the Training and Retraining Trust.  \nAll operators must initially participate in the written and practical test with no execption. In the event the  \noperator is applying for certification of more than one (1) type and size of crane, each operator must pass the  \nwritten and practical \u201chands on\u201d test for each specific crane separately.

A practical exam would  \nalso be required if the operator is unable to document at least 1000 hours of experience during the immediately  \npreceding certification period, operating the crane or hoisting equipment for which re-certification is sought.  \na. An operator applying for re-certification and not wishing to take the practical exam must provide a  \ncomplete employment record of 1000 hours of work history on cranes or hoisting equipment that re-  \ncertification is sought, within the previous five (5) year period.
