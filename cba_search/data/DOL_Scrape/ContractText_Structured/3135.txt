determination that involuntary transfers must occur. Teachers shall not be subject to involuntary transfer  
to an alternative school for disruptive students.  
In case of staff reduction in a school, volunteers will be transferred first to positions for which they are  
qualified in the judgment of the Superintendent. Involuntary transfers will then be assigned to positions  
for which they are qualified in the judgment of the Superintendent. Teachers who are being involuntarily  
transferred by the district for reasons of staff reduction in a school shall have priority on assignment to  
open positions over all voluntary transfers.  
Involuntary transfers as described in paragraph "a" shall be based on seniority in Pasco County. The

occurs, within the area of assignment affected, shall be first transferred. In grades Pre-K (K)-5 "area of  
assignment" shall mean: Pre-K and K, or elementary grades 1-5.  
Teachers transferred under this provision shall not be again subject to involuntary transfers for a period of  
one (1) year. Should a position become available at the same school from which a teacher was  
involuntarily transferred due to a staff reduction, the teacher shall have the opportunity to return to such  
school, subject to all of the following conditions:  
1) The same or similar position needs to be filled no later than the end of the school year following the  
school year of the transfer.  
2) The position is in the same area of assignment from which the teacher was transferred.  
3) The teacher is certified for the position.  
4) The teacher is qualified for the position in the judgment of the Superintendent.  
In cases in which more than one teacher has been involuntarily transferred from the same area of  
assignment, at the same school, and meet the above conditions, the teacher with the most seniority  
shall first be given the option to return.  
. Should it become necessary to reduce the number of staff members at an alternative school for disruptive  
students the school principal after receiving the recommendations relative to the program needs from the  
staff, will determine the teacher(s) to be transferred. Teachers selected for involuntary transfers shall be  
given notice of the involuntary transfers and the reason therefore in writing.  
. The procedures described in paragraphs "a" through "e" are not intended to apply to individual  
involuntary transfers related to performance or other problems.  
2. Teacher Replacing a Teacher on Extended Leave  
A regular employed teacher on annual contract, professional service contract, or continuing contract who  
transfers to an open position replacing a teacher on extended leave shall be subject to an involuntary transfer  
should the person on leave return to his/her position. Upon accepting such position, the teacher will be  
notified in writing that he/she may be subject to such transfer. This does not apply to a person newly hired to  
the district to replace a person on leave as governed by Article VIII, Section A-6 a).

### ARTICLE VII - WORKING CONDITIONS  
### 
develop a school-wide plan to enhance student behavior, which shall be in compliance with the Code of  
Student Conduct.  
The plan shall be presented to the principal for approval and to the faculty for a vote. Prior to the vote, a  
teacher, upon his/her request, will be provided a copy of the plan. The committee shall meet periodically  
during the school year to review the plan and to consider adjustments for improving the plan. The committee  
is encouraged to facilitate the sharing among faculty members of effective interventions/preventions and to  
develop a program to manage students more effectively.  
2. While on duty, a teacher has a general responsibility for student control and a major responsibility for  
controlling those students under his/her direct supervision. The Board recognizes its responsibility to give  
full support and assistance to teachers in maintaining the appropriate discipline necessary to insure that  
effective teaching and learning takes place in an orderly and disciplined classroom without the distraction  
caused by disobedient, disrespectful, violent, abusive, uncontrollable, and disruptive students. Teachers and  
administrators need to work together mutually supporting each other in a manner to maintain proper student  
behavior and to promote a safe educational environment.  
3. Teachers have the responsibility and authority to establish and maintain classroom order within the  
frameworks of Board and school policies. Should it become necessary for a teacher to use reasonable force to  
maintain classroom/school order, the teacher shall follow the guidelines as provided in the Code of Student  
Conduct.  
4. If, in the opinion of the teacher, and within the guidelines of the school's plan and the Code of Student  
Conduct, a student is disrupting regular classroom activities, the teacher may report the action to the  
principal. The teacher may also submit a recommended course of action consistent with the Code of Student  
Conduct for the principal's consideration. The teacher’s recommendation shall be in writing and be within the  
guidelines of the school’s plan and the Code of Student Conduct. The principal shall employ the teacher’s  
recommended consequence or a more serious disciplinary action; or the principal may determine that a lesser  
disciplinary action is appropriate. If the principal determines that a lesser disciplinary action is appropriate,  
the principal should consult with the teacher prior to taking disciplinary action.  
Any teacher shall have the right to send a student to the office whenever the student is involved in a serious  
disturbance in the classroom. The teacher will notify the office immediately when this action is taken. Such  
notification shall include a personal verbal and/or written explanation of the disturbance. Students removed  
from class for a Level 3 offense as described by the Code of Student Conduct shall not be returned for the  
remainder of that class period or a minimum of thirty (30) minutes for schools which do not have set time  
periods for classes. Should this not be possible, the principal shall consult with the teacher prior to returning  
the student to class.  
5. Student disciplinary infractions shall be reported on the appropriate referral form approved for the school.  
The school administration shall make such forms readily available. At the discretion of the teacher, he/she  
may retain a copy of the form. Upon referral by the teacher, serious disturbance behavioral problems are the  
principal's responsibility for appropriate disciplinary action. Final action shall be taken within five (5) days  
unless there are extenuating circumstances. A copy of the discipline form with principal's action noted shall  
be returned to the teacher as soon as possible, but not more than five (5) days from the date of the referral.  
6. A teacher may request that a disobedient, disrespectful, violent, abusive, uncontrollable, or disruptive student  
be removed from his/her class for the remainder of the school year under any of the following circumstances:  
a) who has been documented by the teacher to repeatedly interfere with the teacher's ability to communicate  
effectively with the students in the class or with the ability of the student's classmates to learn;  
b) whose behavior the teacher determines is so disobedient, disrespectful, violent, abusive, uncontrollable,  
or disruptive that it seriously interferes with the teacher's ability to communicate effectively with the  
students in the class or with the ability of the student's classmates to learn; or  
c) who has threatened personal harm or property damage against the teacher or the teacher's family.  
Upon such request the principal may not return the student to that teacher's class without the teacher's  
consent unless the committee established herein determines that such placement is the best or only  
alternative. The teacher and the Placement Review Committee must render decisions within five (5) days of  
the removal of the student from the classroom. Placement options, however, are limited by program

eligibility requirements, School Board policies, and state and federal laws. If the Placement Review  
Committee’s decision is contrary to the decision of the teacher to withhold consent to the return of the  
removed student to the teacher’s class, the teacher may appeal the committee’s decision to the  
Superintendent. The request to appeal to the Superintendent must be in writing and filed within three (3)  
work days of notification to the teacher of the committee’s decision.

school year, each school shall establish a Placement Review Committee to determine placement of a student  
when a teacher withholds consent to the return of a student to the teacher's class. Before selecting members to  
the committee, the principal and faculty will determine the size of the committee. The ratio of the number of  
members selected by the teachers and the number selected by the principal shall be approximately 2:1, if the  
number of volunteers and/or nominees exceeds the approximate two-thirds (2/3) number designated to be  
selected by teachers, an election will be held to determine which teachers fill the positions. The chairperson  
of the Placement Review Committee shall be elected by the members of the committee. The chairperson shall  
serve as a member of the school's discipline committee. A convened Placement Review Committee must  
include at least two (2) teachers, one (1) selected by the faculty and one (1) selected by the teacher who has  
removed the student, and one (1) member of the school’s staff who is selected by the principal. The teacher  
selected by the teacher who has removed the student may or may not be a current member of the school’s  
committee.

prevention, conflict resolution, verbal aggression diffusion, and related areas. The dates and topics of such  
training shall be provided to the Union and posted at each school on the bulletin board and/or faculty

discipline as specified in the Code of Student Conduct and including that which is required under Florida  
Statutes. The Board, Superintendent, and principal shall fully support teachers in their efforts to follow and  
enforce the Student Code of Conduct.

ensure this safety. Any case of battery upon or an assault against a teacher in the performance of his/her  
duties shall be reported promptly to the principal or immediate supervisor. In such case, the legal assistance  
specified in Article IX, Section C(1), shall be provided if necessary, and the teacher maintains the right to  
report such action to legal authorities. Violence against school personnel by students will be enforced as  
specified in the Code of Student Conduct. Teachers who are involved in such cases shall not lose regular  
salary for any time lost from their duties when their presence is required before a judicial body. In case of  
disability, the Board agrees to continue the teacher's contractual salary until said employee is eligible for  
Workers' Compensation benefits. The Board agrees to follow the provisions of Florida Statute 1012.63 in  
regard to illness-in-line-of-duty leave.

1) the birth of a child of the employee and care following the child's birth,  
2) the adoption of a child by the employee including the events and process leading to the adoption, and  
care following the adoption,  
3) the placement and/or care of the child in the foster care of the employee,  
4) the care of a child, spouse or parent of the employee who has a serious health condition (as defined in  
Part A(5). For the purposes of this paragraph: (a) the term "spouse" means a husband or wife as  
defined or recognized under State law for purposes of marriage; (b) the term "parent" means a  
biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the  
employee was a child -- this term does not include parents "in law"; (c) the terms "son" or "daughter"  
mean a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in  
loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a  
mental or physical disability.  
5) the treatment of a serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing his/her job.  
A "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that  
involves:  
a. any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to in-patient care (i.e., an  
overnight stay in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility);  
b. any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities, of  
more than three calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision  
of) a healthcare provider; or  
2005-2006 Instructional Master Contract Page 31  

### ARTICLE VIII - LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
### 
c. continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a healthcare provider for a chronic or long-  
term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a  
period of incapacity of more than three calendar days; or for prenatal care.  
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not "serious health  
conditions" unless inpatient hospital care is required.  
b) The twelve-month period for entitlement under this section will be measured from July 1 through June  
30.  
c) In order to be eligible, the employee must have been employed by the Board for at least one year, and the  
employee must actually have received pay for 1,250 or more hours from the Board during the twelve-  
month period immediately preceding the unpaid leave. Holidays, earned sick leave, and vacation time for  
which the employee has been paid but has not worked shall be included in the calculation above. Sick  
Leave Bank, Workers' Compensation, suspension with pay, and sabbatical leave time will not be counted.  
d) Leave, except for certain exceptions described in Part (e) for instructional employees, commences upon  
the absence of the employee from work and ends on the day and time the employee reports back to work.  
e) Instructional employees are subject to additional rules and procedures with regard to leave periods  
associated with Family and Medical Leave. For the purposes of Family and Medical Leave,  
"instructional employees" are defined as those employees who are included in the instructional bargaining  
unit and whose principal function is to teach and instruct students in a class, a small group, or an  
individual setting.  
If an eligible instructional employee requests intermittent or reduced leave which is based upon planned  
medical treatment and this leave would be for more than 20% of the total number of working days over  
the period the leave would extend, the Board may require the employee to choose either to:  
1) take leave for periods of a particular duration, not greater than the duration of the planned treatment;  
or  
2) transfer temporarily to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified, which has  
equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the  
employee's regular position.  
Intermittent or reduced leave under this provision will begin no sooner than the first day where leave is  
granted and end no later than the last day where leave is granted and will include all dates granted  
between the beginning and ending dates.  
If an instructional employee takes leave near the end of a semester, the Board may require the employee  
to stay out on leave until the end of the semester according to the following guidelines:  
1) Leave beginning more than five weeks before the end of the semester. The Board may require the  
instructional employee to continue taking leave until the end of the semester if:  
a) the leave will last at least three weeks, and  
b) the employee would return to work during the three week period before the end of the semester.  
2) Leave beginning less than five weeks before the end of the semester. If an employee begins leave  
for a purpose other than the employee's own serious health condition during the five week period  
before the end of the semester, the Board may require the instructional employee to continue taking  
leave until the end of the semester if:  
a. the leave will last more than two weeks, and  
b. the employee will return to work during the two-week period before the end of the semester.  
3) Leave beginning with less than three weeks before the end of the semester. If an employee begins  
leave for a purpose other than the employee's own serious health condition during the three week  
period before the end of the semester, and the leave will last more than five working days, the Board  
may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the semester.  
All leave taken under Part (e) will count against the employee's twelve-week entitlement. If the  
instructional employee's twelve weeks of leave entitlement under the FMLA run out before the leave  
period is completed, the Board will continue health benefits, restore the employee to his/her previous  
position unless the employee's position has been affected by reduction in force and/or layoff, and  
provide other FMLA entitlement throughout the whole period of the leave.

The leave mentioned in this section is subject to the following restrictions and privileges:  
An employee must first use all available unused earned paid sick leave before unpaid FMLA leave  
will be granted.  
The employee will be restored to his/her former position unless the employee's position has been  
affected by reduction in force and/or layoff.  
The Board shall require materials documenting the reason for the leave before granting a leave of  
absence under this section.  
It is the responsibility of the employee to obtain the necessary documentation and to furnish the  
documentation to the Board.  
The Board may request verification of a medical condition for which leave has been granted under  
this section at any reasonable interval, but not more often than once every thirty days, unless:  
a. the employee requests an extension of leave;  
b. circumstances described by the original documentation have changed significantly (i.e., the  
duration of the illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or  
c. the employer receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the  
documentation.  
If the Board pays the employee contributions missed by the employee while on leave, the employee  
will be required to reimburse the Board for delinquent payments (on a payroll deduction schedule)  
upon return from leave. The employee will be required to sign a written statement at the beginning of  
the leave period authorizing the payroll deduction for delinquent payments. If an employee fails to  
return to work for the Board after FMLA leave, the Board shall take necessary steps to recover its  
share of the health benefit premium payments made on the employee's behalf during a period of  
unpaid FMLA leave unless the employee's position has been affected by reduction in force and/or  
layoff.  
An employee may continue coverage by continuing to pay the employee's portion of the premiums,  
including dependent coverage, while on leave.  
The employee must notify the Board as soon as practicable once the employee knows that a leave will  
be needed. For a foreseeable leave, such as for birth, adoption or planned medical treatment, the  
employee must provide at least 30 days notice to the Board. In all cases, the employee must furnish a  
request to the Board on a form provided by the Board.  
Prior to the employee's return to work from an employee disability, the employee shall submit  
medical certification of the employee's fitness to return to work.  
The Board retains the right to implement reasonable rules and regulations with regard to the use of  
leaves of absence within the requirements of the FMLA. This includes but is not limited to requiring  
a second opinion, at the Board's discretion, from a Board-paid doctor with regard to a medical  
disability, and the use of forms for requests for leave, physician documentation and fitness to return to  
work.  
In the event that the Board exercises its right to a second medical opinion and the opinion conflicts  
with the first doctor's opinion in the medical certification, then a third opinion may be required by a  
Board-paid physician mutually agreed upon by the Board and employee. This third opinion will be  
final and binding upon the Board and the employee.  
h) Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave -- An eligible employee who is entitled to a twelve-week leave  
under the provisions of this section may take that leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in  
certain cases. An intermittent leave schedule is one in which the employee may take the allowable leave  
intermittently, or in blocks of days at a time, as needed. A reduced leave schedule is one in which the  
employee's daily or weekly hours are reduced, as needed. Leave will be granted intermittently or on a  
reduced leave basis in the case of the serious health condition of the employee or of the child, spouse or  
parent of the employee, provided that it is medically necessary and that a certification from a physician is  
obtained. The amount of Family and Medical Leave used where an employee takes leave intermittently

or on a reduced leave schedule will be determined in accordance with the applicable regulations of the  
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, currently §825.205 of the Interim Regulations.  
i) Effect of Leave on Board-Paid Benefits -- During the period of leave governed by this section, the Board  
will pay the portion of the insurance premium which it normally paid prior to the leave, such as major  
medical, surgical, dental, vision, life, and flexible benefits.

Intervention Procedures for Elementary or Secondary Schools to determine the credibility of such threat. The  
student shall be removed from the teacher’s class until the threat assessment is concluded and the teacher is  
notified of the assessment results. If the threat is made by a person not under the jurisdiction of the school  
board, the teacher will not be required to meet with that person until the matter has been investigated and  
documented by the principal and the teacher has been notified of the results of that investigation. The teacher  
has the right to have an administrator present at any future meetings with the person making the threat.  
2. Death or Disability

teacher upon proof of claim for clothing and/or personal property destroyed or damaged as a result of any  
assault or vandalism upon said teacher in the course of fulfilling his/her employment responsibilities or from  
any act by the teacher for the purpose of preventing injury to persons or damage to property located on the  
school site during the times when the teacher is on said site at any school-related activity.  
No claim covered under other provisions of this Agreement shall be paid from this account.  
If any portion of this account is not expended in any year of this Agreement, an amount equal to the  
unexpended sum shall be budgeted in addition to the $2000.00 for the following year.  
2. If said clothing and/or personal property is insured, the employee must submit a claim to the appropriate  
insurance company. In the event of full reimbursement for such claim, the Board shall make no payment. If  
the insurance company reimburses all but the deductible amount specified in the employee's policy, the  
Board will pay an amount equal to the deductible amount not to exceed $500. If the claim is for less than the  
deductible amount specified or the clothing or personal property is not insured, the Board will pay an amount  
equal to the current value of the property not to exceed $500.  
3. To be eligible for reimbursement as described in paragraph 1, the teacher must report the damage to the  
worksite supervisor as soon as possible and complete the Comprehensive Accident-Injury/Loss form and  
submit it to the worksite supervisor.  
The reimbursement of damaged or vandalized personal property (other than motor vehicle) is limited to those  
items that the teacher uses to perform his/her job and/or duty responsibilities.  
In the event the claim is for vandalism to the teacher's personal vehicle, a copy of his/her automobile  
insurance policy declaration page and an estimate for repair must be included with the Comprehensive  
Accident/Injury/Loss Form.  
Payment of the claim is subject to the approval by USEP President and Director of Employee Relations.

criteria:  
a) be 50 years of age or older at the time of retirement;  
b) have 25 or more years of creditable FRS service;  
c) employed on or before June 30, 2001 and who have reached Step 13 on the teacher salary schedule, or  
whose number of years of experience in the Pasco school district is equal to the number of years of  
service on Step 13 of the teacher salary schedule, or teachers hired on or after July 1, 2001 who have  
twelve (12) years of Pasco service, the last ten (10) of which must be Pasco continuous service; and  
d) have retired under the Florida Retirement System (FRS) Defined Benefit Plan (Pension Plan) or who  
retires with any vested benefit in the Defined Benefit Plan (Pension Plan).  
e) Effective July 1, 2001, those instructional bargaining unit members who meet the above criteria will be  
eligible to receive the early retirement benefit in accordance with the following:

2005-2006 Instructional Master Contract Page 37  

### ARTICLE X - SALARY AND TEACHER WELFARE  
### 
retirement benefit. The unreduced FRS retirement benefit is calculated using the premise of the member  
being sixty-two (62) years of age at the time of retirement.  
g) A member who is at least fifty-five (55) years of age but less than sixty-two (62) years of age at the time  
of early retirement will receive an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the difference between  
the unreduced FRS benefit and the reduced FRS early retirement benefit.  
h) At the time of early retirement, if the early retirement monthly benefit has a single sum value (present  
value) of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) as of the date the early retirement monthly benefit is  
first effective, then the Board will provide a one-time lump sum payment equal to the single sum value  
(present value) of the early retirement monthly benefit.  
i) In lieu of the above, for any employee meeting the above eligibility criteria and who has out-of-state  
service, or any other qualifying service, and is eligible to purchase such service according to FRS rules  
and regulations, the district may purchase such service if the purchase of such service would total 30  
years and entitle the employee to full retirement under FRS. It is clearly understood that the Board shall  
provide the monthly benefit or out-of-state service or any other qualifying service whichever is more  
economical for the Board.  
2. This provision shall not prohibit the Board from paying additional retirement bonuses provided for in this  
Agreement or future bonuses agreed to by the Board and the Union.  
3. No employee shall be required by the Board to take advantage of the provisions of this article.  
4. If an employee chooses one of these aforementioned early retirement options, the Board will have no further  
obligation toward his/her retirement benefits.  
5. A teacher who selects one of these aforementioned early retirement options is required to retire from the  
Florida Retirement System (FRS) and terminate his/her employment with the district. Therefore, such  
teacher is not eligible to participate in the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) as the DROP  
requires a teacher to retire from the FRS yet continue to work within the district.  
SECTION E - Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP)  
1. Effective July 1, 1998, employees who qualify for the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) may  
elect to participate in that program as provided by the procedures set forth by the district and by Florida  
Statute 121.091. An employee’s salary, benefits, terms, and conditions of employment, as specified in this  
Agreement will remain in full force during the employee’s participation in the DROP. An employee can  
void his/her DROP participation at the DROP termination date, re-enroll in FRS and continue in his/her  
current position in the district, by making such request in writing to the Board at least thirty (30) calendar  
days prior to his/her original DROP termination date. An employee may resign his/her employment with the  
Board and terminate his/her participation in DROP prior to the original DROP termination date by submitting  
an amended resignation to the Board.  
2. Employees who elect to enter DROP and elect to receive a lump-sum payment of accrued vacation (annual)  
leave earned in accordance with Board policy upon beginning participation in DROP, shall have said lump-  
sum payment paid into a Board-approved 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an Employer Paid 403(b)  
Plan subject to annual contribution limits. Employees who receive a lump-sum payment of accrued (annual)  
leave upon termination of DROP and termination of employment shall have said lump-sum payment paid  
into a Board—approved 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an Employer Paid 403(b) Plan subject to  
annual contribution limits.  
3. Effective July 1, 1999, employees who enter the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) and are  
eligible for one hundred percent (100%) of their accumulated terminal sick leave in accordance with the  
Meritorious Attendance Incentive Pay, Article X, Section G of the Instructional Master Contract, shall have  
their accumulated terminal sick leave paid into a Board-approved 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an  
Employer Paid 403(b) Plan subject to annual contribution limits and according to the following.  
4. The initial payment will be made on June 30th following the employee’s DROP effective date. Subsequent  
payments shall be made each June 30th following the employee’s DROP effective date anniversary.

Final Upon Separation 100.0%  
5. The rate of pay used to calculate the amount to be placed in the 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an  
Employer Paid 403(b) Plan shall be the employee’s rate of pay upon entering DROP or the employee’s rate  
of pay on each payment date. The employee must elect the rate of pay option upon entering DROP. The rate  
of pay used for the Employer Paid 403(b) Plan is the same rate of pay used in the 401 (a) Qualified  
Retirement Plan.  
6. The 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and the Employer Paid 403(b) Plan allows participating employees to  
defer federal income tax and permanently avoid the payment of Social Security tax and Medicare tax on  
eligible plan contributions.  
7. Employees/DROP participants do not have access to these funds until after they terminate their employment.  
8. Employees of the Board who enter the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) remain eligible for Sick  
Leave Bank participation. However, terminal sick leave days that have been paid to the Board approved  
401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an Employer Paid 403(b) Plan shall be treated as if those days still  
remain in the employee’s accumulated terminal sick leave balance when determining commencement of sick  
leave bank benefits, so long as the employee has met the requirements of the Sick Leave Bank appropriate to  
his/her bargaining unit contract.  
Fund Withdrawal: Employees under fifty-five (55) years of age.  
9. All participating employees who are under fifty-five (55) years of age at the time of termination and choose  
at the time of termination to take a cash distribution in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of their  
respective balance from the Board approved 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan and/or an Employer Paid  
403(b) Plan and are assessed a ten percent (10%) withdrawal penalty, shall be reimbursed 2.35% of the  
withdrawal by the Board. This reimbursement is an amount equal to the difference between the ten percent  
(10%) withdrawal penalty and the current Social Security and Medicare combined tax contribution rate of  
7.65%. If the withdrawal penalty and/or Social Security and Medicare tax rates change, the Board and Union  
agree to renegotiate the reimbursement rate. If a fee is charged to process the IRS 1099 form, the Board will  
reimburse these same employees the one-time administrative fee.  
10. Upon separation of service or a June 30" payment of accumulated sick leave and maximizing the 401(a)  
Qualified Retirement Plan contribution, any remaining terminal pay for accrued sick leave or vacation leave,  
subject to Board and State limitations, will be deposited in an Employer Paid 403(b) Plan. The Employer  
Paid 403(b) Plan is similar to the 401(a) Qualified Retirement Plan except for contribution limits.  
SECTION F - Retiree Healthcare Premium  
1. Teachers who retire after January 1, 1997, the Board agrees to contribute the same amount toward the  
retiree's health premium each year as it does towards the regular employee's premium. This contribution will  
begin upon retirement and continue until the retiree is eligible to receive Medicare Benefits. This  
contribution is contingent upon the retiree meeting all of the following conditions:  
a) 30 years of service under the FRS or at least 25 years of service under FRS and is at least age 50 at  
retirement;

b) at least 20 years of service in the district;  
c) contributes his/her health insurance subsidy received from the State of Florida toward the cost of this  
medical premium; and,  
d) continues to participate in a Board-sponsored health plan after his/her retirement.  
2. Effective July 1, 2000, if a teacher retires as a result of full disability, funds from the insurance funds retained  
earnings will be used to contribute the same amount toward the retiree's health premium (medical, dental, and  
vision) each year as the Board does toward the premium of a regular employee. The contribution will begin  
upon retirement and continue until the retiree receives Medicare benefits or until twenty-four (24) months  
have elapsed from the date of retirement, whichever comes first.  
This condition is contingent upon the retiree meeting all of the following conditions:  
a) the teacher must have completed at least ten (10) years of creditable service under the Florida Retirement  
System (FRS);  
b) the teacher must have completed at least ten (10) years of service in the district;  
c) the teacher must be approved for full disability retirement under FRS and have provided the district with  
proof of application for full disability retirement under the Social Security Administration;  
d) the teacher must contribute his/her health insurance subsidy received from the State of Florida toward the  
cost of the health premium; and  
e) continues to participate in a Board-sponsored health plan after his/her retirement.

The District School Board of Pasco County will provide meritorious attendance incentive pay to members of  
the bargaining unit at normal retirement (retirement under any established retirement plan with full or  
reduced benefits as provided by law) or to the bargaining unit member's beneficiaries if service is terminated  
by death. Meritorious attendance incentive pay shall be determined as follows:

name of the employee upon retirement.  
Fund Withdrawal: Employees under fifty-five (55) years of age.  
All participating employees who are under fifty-five (55) years of age at the time of termination and

the IRS 1099 form, the Board will reimburse these same employees the one-time administrative fee.  
i) Teachers who retire under the Florida Retirement System (FRS) with full or reduced benefits as provided  
by law and who receive a lump-sum payment of accrued vacation leave earned in accordance with Board

Qualified Retirement Plan except for contribution limits.  
3. Separation Incentives  
If employment is terminated for any reason other than retirement or death, members of the bargaining unit  
shall receive one-half (1/2) the percentage of all accumulated sick leave as stipulated in the schedule in

dependents' medical bills which in turn result in benefit dollars saved by the employees' Group Medical  
Benefits Plan.  
2005-2006 Instructional Master Contract Page 41  

### ARTICLE X - SALARY AND TEACHER WELFARE  
### 
1. The cash incentive paid to an insured employee who discovers an overcharge on a medical bill for that  
employee or his/her dependent and paid as an allowable charge by the School Board group medical benefits  
carrier/administrator shall be fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the over-charge that is recovered by the  
group medical benefits carrier/administrator as a result of direct negotiations between the employee and the  
provider and shall be limited to a maximum of 1,000 dollars for each overcharge. No refund shall be made to  
the insured employee until the group medical benefits carrier/administrator receives the actual refund from  
the provider of service.  
2. For purposes of the cash incentive, only hospital expenses, clinical laboratory charges, physician fees, and  
other eligible medical expenses covered by the Group Medical Benefits Plan shall be considered in  
determining the amount payable to insured employees under this program.  
3. The employee shall contact the Union to obtain a Request for Reimbursement form and procedures. After  
the overcharge has been recovered, the group medical benefits carrier/administrator shall disburse a check to  
the employee in the amount of the cash incentive. Cash incentives are considered income to employees for  
tax purposes and subject to being reported on their federal income tax return.  
4. The Board shall not get involved in resolving any differences between the employee and the medical  
providers of service with respect to disputed charges. Insured employees shall be solely responsible for  
handling such disputes.  
SECTION I -— Employee Assistance Program (EAP)

request, short-term counseling and/or assistance with referrals for appropriate services. The program will also  
promote programs for wellness, nutrition, exercise, and stress reduction.  
Participation or nonparticipation in the EAP shall be voluntary and shall not be a factor in any adverse  
employment action by the Board. All personally identifiable information relating to an employee as a result of  
an employee’s participation in the EAP shall be held in strictest confidence by the director and staff of the EAP  
and such shall not be made a part of or otherwise noted in the employee’s personnel file.  
An EAP Committee will be established for the purpose of evaluating the services provided which shall include,  
but not be limited to, the services provided, the cost and funding source, availability, accessibility, utilization,  
and its effectiveness toward meeting the needs of the employees. The committee shall meet periodically during  
the school year and by May 1 of each year shall make recommendations to the Board and USEP for the purpose  
of further negotiating the improvement and/or revision of the program. —The EAP Committee will function as a  
sub-committee of the current Insurance Committee. The Board and USEP will mutually agree to appoint  
members to the EAP sub-committee who are not current members of the Insurance Committee. The EAP  
Committee shall consist of an equal number of members selected by the Board and USEP.
