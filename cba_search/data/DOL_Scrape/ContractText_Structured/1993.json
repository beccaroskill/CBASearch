When-  \never possible, the work week will contain five (5) eight (8)-  \n14  \nArticte IV \u2014 Sec. 1  \nhour scheduled work days. The present work week is seven  \n(7) consecutive days ending Sunday midnight except in those  \ncases where the W-day and ST-days span midnight.  \nB. WORK DAY (W-Day): A work day is normally the  \ntwenty-four (24)-hour period from midnight to midnight of  \nthe day on which an employee is scheduled to work. When  \na normal work day spans midnight, time shall be charged  \non the day in which the majority of hours is worked. When  \nthe normal work day is divided evenly before and after mid-  \nnight, time shall be charged on the day on which work was  \nstarted.  \nC. DAY OFF (ST-Day): A day off or an ST- (scheduled  \ntime off) day is normally the twenty-four (24)-hour period  \nfrom midnight to midnight of the day on which an employee  \nis not scheduled to work.

Working Hours  \nA. The parties hereto recognize that the business of the  \nCompany requires continuous operation for twenty-four (24)  \nhours of every day. In such operation it is inherent that work-  \ning schedules must be established by the Company and  \nmay from time to time be changed to meet changing condi-  \ntions.  \nB. Normal work schedules will be established by the Com-  \npany and posted for each employee or group of employees.  \nSection 3. Temporary Changes in Working Hours and  \nWork Schedules  \nA. Temporary changes in work schedules or working  \nhours will be made:  \n(1) When an employee is substituting for another em-  \nployee who is off duty. When notification of such  \nsubstitution occurs after the beginning of a work  \nweek in which the substitution is to occur, only the  \nworking hours of the substituting employee\u2019s W-  \ndays will be changed for that work week. If the  \nsubstitution extends beyond the end of the work  \nweek, or if the substitution starts at the beginning  \nof a work week, the schedule of the substituting  \nemployee will be the normal work schedule of the  \nrelieved employee.  \nWhen it is necessary to carry out work which must  \nbe done outside normal working hours, such as  \nwork on equipment which cannot be made avail-  \nable during normal working hours, and work in two  \n(2) or more shifts on equipment which is out of  \nservice for overhaul or because of breakdown and  \n(2  \neee\u201d  \n16  \nArticle IV \u2014 Sec. 3  \nwhich must be returned to service promptly.

Sub-sections (a)  \nand (b) of this Paragraph A (2) shall not be appili-  \ncable to employees involved in equipment outages  \nthat have a direct effect on the operating capacity  \nof power generating stations.  \n(3) When an employee is scheduled to attend a for-  \nmal training school or other Company training pro-  \ngrams. In-these cases, both the W-days and ST-  \ndays will be changed to conform with the training  \nschedules. If the employee is notified forty-eight  \n(48) hours before the beginning of that work week,  \novertime for a temporary change in work sched-  \nules will not apply.  \nB. An employee working ona temporarily changed sched-  \nule may be returned to his normal work schedule at any  \ntime. Lunch periods established for such schedules shall  \nnot exceed one hour.  \nC. Normal work schedules will not be changed tempo-  \nrarily for short emergencies. When an employee is called  \nout for emergency work, he ordinarily will be dismissed when  \nthe emergency is over.  \nD.

This applies only to the first such change in  \nany work week. For the purpose of this Paragraph,  \nsuch changed shift schedule is one which involves  \na change from one shift to another\u2014day shift to  \nmiddle or night shift, etc., and does not include  \neither a change involving only different hours in  \nthe same shift or a return from a temporary shift  \nschedule to a regular shift schedule.  \nThe first eight (8) hours working on a temporarily  \nchanged schedule as provided in Section 3 A (2)  \nof this Article where the temporary change in  \nwork schedule requires a change in the employee's  \nstarting time from one group of hours to another  \nas shown in the following table:  \nSTARTING TIME GROUP  \n5:00 A.M. to 12:59 P.M. |  \n1:00 - Il  \n9:00 P.M. to 4:59 A.M.

The following will be considered overtime and paid  \nfor at double time:  \n(1) Any hours worked on the second ST-day in a work  \nweek.  \n(2) Each consecutive hour worked immediately  \nfollowing sixteen (16) consecutive hours worked.  \nC. Work on a Contract Holiday/Actual Holiday (Article Vil  \n4 B) will be paid for as follows:  \n(1) When it is a W-day, all scheduled hours worked  \nwill be paid for at time and one-half. In addition,  \nstraight time will be paid for the scheduled hours.  \n(2) When it is an ST-day, the number of hours actu-  \nally worked, which would have been scheduled  \nfor the employee if it were a W-day or which were  \nscheduled for the employee for whom he is  \nsubstituting, will be paid for at:  \n(a) Double and one-half time, when it is the  \nsecond ST-day in a work week.  \n(b) Double time on the first ST-day.  \nIn addition, straight time will be paid for such  \nhours.  \n(3) All other hours worked will be paid for at double  \ntime.  \nD. When working at foreign utilities during emergency  \nconditions, employees will be paid for all compensabie hours  \nat one-half time premium over\u2019 their regular hourly rate in  \naddition to the Labor Agreement's normal pay practices.  \nArticle IV \u2014 Sec. 5  \nSection 5. Rest Periods  \nA Rest periods shall be applicable in accordance with  \nthe following provisions when employees are called out or  \nwhen arrangements are made in advance for work during  \nnon-scheduled hours provided employees are eligible as  \ndefined in the \u201cRest Period Rules\u201d of Exhibit B of this Agree-  \nment.  \nB. Employees working for a period that consists of at least  \nthree (3) overtime hours, and up to sixteen (16) consecutive  \novertime hours, shall be entitled, when relieved from duty,  \nto a rest period as shown on the table in Exhibit B. If sched-  \nuled hours fall within the time designated as a rest period,  \nthe employee will be paid straight time pay for these sched-  \nuled hours. Employees required to work during scheduled  \nhours that fall within the prescribed rest period, will receive  \npay at time and one-half the employee\u2019s straight time rate  \nfor such hours worked.  \nC. Employees working sixteen (16) or more consecutive  \nhours shail be entitled, when relieved from duty, to an eight  \n(8)-hour rest period or a rest period as shown on the rest  \nperiod table, whichever is greater, without loss of straight  \ntime pay for scheduled hours falling within the rest period.  \nHowever, employees required to work during this period will  \nbe paid two times the straight time rate for any hours worked  \nwithin eight (8) hours after being released from the previous  \nwork period and their rest period will be calculated using  \nthe twelve (12)-hour cumulative rule as provided for in Ex-  \nhibit B.  \nD. The intent of rest periods is for employees to be re-  \nleased from work when they have worked sufficient over-  \ntime hours to become eligible for a rest period. If an em-  \nployee requests to be released on rest period, their request  \nshail be granted unless there is an emergency or the com-  \npany is unable to obtain relief, when necessary.  \n20  \nArticte I\\\u00a5 \u2014 Sec. 5-7  \nE The rest period table as described in Paragraphs B  \nand C of this Section 5 is not applicable to vacation days,  \nholidays, paid personal time off and ST-days.  \nSection 6.

Both parties recognize that certain employees cov-  \nered by this Agreement are in jobs which are exempt from  \nthe provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and that em-  \nployees may be hired or transferred to new jobs which will  \nlikewise be exempt. In order to meet the requirements of  \nthe Act, the Company will continue to classify all employees  \nas exempt or non-exempt.  \nB. Some of the jobs may be of such nature that the work  \ncannot be scheduled to conform to a definite schedule (such  \nas a forty (40)-hour week or five (5) eight (8)-hour days) and  \nthat, therefore, the overtime provisions of this Agreement  \nmay not be applicable to these jobs.  \nC. It is agreed that for any new jobs in which there are  \nemployees eligible for Union membership, the Union and  \nCompany will jointly determine whether the work is of this  \nnature.  \nSection 7. Residence Requirement  \nA. Employees in the job classifications tisted below must  \nreside within thirty (30) miles driving distance between their  \nhome and their Job Headquarters.  \nCustomer Service Clerk (Customer Contact Center)  \nCustomer Service Representative  \nCustomer Service Representative-Shift  \nElectrician Leader-FS  \nElectrician-FS  \nEquipment Operator-FS  \nInstrument and Control Maintenance-Leader  \n{incumbent only)  \n21  \nArticle iV \u2014 Sec. 7-8  \nInstrument Man  \nInstrument Man-Trainee  \nJourneyman Electrician-FS  \nJourneyman Lineman-FS  \nJourneyman Mechanic-FS  \nLineman-FS  \nLineman Leader-FS  \nMaterial Handler-RM  \nMechanic-FS  \nMechanic Leader-FS  \nTroubleman-FS  \nAnyone who enters these progression lines or  \nchanges work location by promotion, demotion, or trans-  \nfer must meet the residency requirement.  \nB.

Whenever necessary, the  \nCompany will maintain at the respective Headquarters a  \nroster of certain employees likely to be called and will select  \nfrom these lists on a rotating or cumulative overtime basis  \nas applicable such available employees as are needed. The  \npurpose of this arrangement is to provide an equitable dis-  \ntribution of overtime work when required. Being subject to  \ncall-out is not to be considered as hours of work and no  \nadditional compensation will be paid to cover this respon-  \nsibility. The Company will maintain records of overtime  \n22  \nArticle IV \u2014 Sec. 8-3  \nworked or offered by job classification. However, full equal-  \nization of overtime cannot be guaranteed. See Exhibit H for  \nCumulative Overtime Procedures.  \nB.

Cail-Outs  \nA. When an employee is called out to work during non-  \nscheduled hours, he shall be paid overtime compensation  \nfor the actual time worked. A minimum compensation equal  \nto four (4) hours\u2019 pay at straight time shall apply when it  \nexceeds the amount of overtime compensation earned dur-  \ning the call-out.  \nB. In the event the occurs on a Contract Holiday/  \nActual Holiday (Article Vil 4 B), the employee shall be com-  \npensated in accordance with this Section 9, or the provi-  \nsions of Section 4C of this Article IV, whichever is greater.  \nC. The minimum compensation is not to apply in cases  \nwhere an employee is called out immediately preceding his  \nscheduled working hours of a W-day and the minimum time  \nperiod overlaps his scheduled hours.  \nD. In order to determine the number of employees to be  \ncalled out for distribution line work, the guidelines described  \nin Exhibit C shall be followed.  \n23  \nArticle IV \u2014 Sec. 10-12  \nSection 10. Prearranged Work  \nA. When arrangements are made in advance for work  \nduring non-scheduled hours, the employee will be paid for  \nthe actual time worked.

Job Canceled  \nA. Employees will be informed of job cancellations as  \nsoon as possible.  \nB. The minimum compensation referred to in  \nSections 9 and 10 of this Article !V will not apply:  \n{1} When a call-out is canceled and the employee is  \nnotified before leaving home.  \n24  \nArticle h\u00a5 \u2014 Sec. 12-13  \n(2) When a prearranged job scheduled for Saturday  \nis canceled and the employee is notified of the  \ncancellation by quitting time of his last scheduled  \nworkday.  \n(3) When a prearranged job scheduled for Sunday is  \ncanceled:  \nNOTE:  Itis the scheduled employee's responsibility to con-  \ntact a predetermined employee after 7:00 PM.  \nSaturday but prior to the starting time of the prear-  \nranged job to determine whether there has been a  \ncancellation.  \n(4) When a prearranged job, for any time other than  \nSub-Section (2) and (3) above, is canceled and  \nthe employee is notified before he leaves home  \nand at least one (1) hour before he is scheduled  \nto report at Headquarters or on the job.  \nC. !f the job is canceled after the time limitations speci-  \nfied in Paragraph B (2), (3) and (4) of this Section 12, the  \nemployee\u2019 may elect to either report or accept the job can-  \ncellation.

Ashift differential for hours worked will be paid to em-  \nployees working on an established rotating or alternating  \nshift job or an established fixed shift job whose shift is  \nregularly scheduled to start during the Afternoon Shift or  \nNight Shift as part of their regular work week.  \n~~  \n25  \nArticle IV \u2014 Sec. 13  \nB. A shift differential will be paid as an addition to the  \nregular straight time hourly rate to an employee who is  \nregularly scheduled and works on the Day Shift, Afternoon  \nShift or Night Shift Saturday or Sunday; the Afternoon Shift  \nor Night Shift, Monday through Friday, as follows:  \nSTARTING TIME SHIFT SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL  \n5:00 A.M. to 12:59 P.M, Day (Monday to Friday) None  \n5:00 A.M. to 12:59 P.M.

For purposes of applying the aforesaid shift differen-  \ntia!, all hours of the regularly scheduled work day period  \nworked by an employee shall be considered as worked on  \nthe shift on which he is scheduled and starts work.  \nD. Shift differential shall be computed at the appropriate  \nrate of pay up to a maximum of double time the shift differ-  \nential applicable to the shift in which the overtime hours  \noccurred,  \nE. An employee temporarily assigned to work in a shift  \njob, or as a replacement for a regular employee in a shift  \njob, shall be paid for the hours so worked the shift differen-  \ntial applicable to the assigned shift job.  \nF. A shift differential will not be allowed in connection  \nwith payment for any overtime worked outside the time lim-  \nits of his normal regular day schedule by an employee  \nassigned to day work. However, such an employee whose  \nentire regularly scheduled straight time work-day period is  \ntemporarily changed to start during the Day Shift, Afternoon  \n26  \nArticle IV \u2014 Sec. 13  \n"], ["Article V \u2014 Sec. 1-2  \nShift or Night Shift Saturday or Sunday; the Afternoon Shift  \n", "or Night Shift, Monday through Friday shail be paid as an  \naddition to his straight time rate the shift differential appli-  \ncable to the changed shift on which the employee starts  \nwork, until he is returned to his regular schedule.  \nG. No shift differentia! shall be included in pay received  \nfor vacation, sick leave, jury duty, holiday off with pay, other  \ntime off with pay, for holiday pay on a holiday worked or in  \nthe calculation of minimum pay under the call-out provisions  \nincluded in this Agreement.  \n"], ["ARTICLE V  \nSENIORITY  \n", "Section 1. New Employees  \nA. Seniority will be credited to an employee only after six  \n(6) months of continuous employment but shall include this  \nfirst six (6) months\u2019 period. During this six (6)-month period,  \nthe employee shall be considered probationary and the Com-  \npany shall have the sole and exclusive right to discharge  \nsuch employee and Article Ill of the Agreement shall not  \napply.  \nSection 2. Promotions \u2014 Transfers \u2014 Demotions  \nA. The Company will give preference to the employee  \nwith seniority when fitness and ability among employees are  \nsubstantially equal in considering them for the purpose of  \npromotion, transfer or demotion.  \nB. For such purposes, employees in an established line  \nof progression (such as operating jobs within a power plant,  \njobs within a coal gang, and line workers systemwide) will  \nbe considered before those not in that line of progression.  \nC. When non-supervisory employees covered by this  \nAgreement are placed in supervisory jobs, their seniority,  \nfor this purpose, will be determined by the following:  \n27  \neee  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \n(1) Temporary  \n(a) Non-supervisory employees who are promoted  \n(b  \n~~  \nto supervisory positions when there is a tem-  \nporary increase in work load: when additional  \ntemporary supervisory manpower is essential;  \nor when other comparable situations arise  \nhave a right to return to their former job classi-  \nfication at their former work location for a pe-  \nriod of six (6) months following their promo-  \ntion; however, the employee will not accrue  \n1600 or job seniority for time spent as a Su  \npervisor and they will not pay Union dues or  \nremain on the call-out roster. In this situation,  \n1600 or job seniority will not be a criteria for  \nselection. In order to maintain rights in their  \nformer Union job, they must be returned to non-  \nsupervisory status within six (6) months of the  \ntemporary promotion. If they return after the  \nsix (6)-month period, they will be placed in an  \nentry level position and for 1600 or job senior-  \nity purposes will only be considered to be  \nahead of other employees with less than Six  \n(6) months of Company Service. It is further  \nunderstood that the utilization of this provision  \nis not intended to provide temporary supervi-  \nsors on a continual basis to circumvent the  \ncreation of permanent supervisors.  \nNon-supervisory employees temporarily pro-  \nmoted to supervisory positions as replace-  \nments for supervisors who are off duty wil! be  \nselected basically by job seniority at the work  \nlocation provided fitness and ability are sub-  \nstantially equal. In this situation the employee  \nwill continue to accrue job Seniority, pay Union  \n28  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \ndues, and remain on the call-out roster. Pay  \ntreatment will be in accordance with Article VI,  \nSection 4, Paragraph A of this Agreement.  \n(2) Permanent  \n(a) Non-supervisory employees who are promoted  \nto supervisory positions have a right to return  \nto their former job classification at their former  \nwork location for a period of twelve (12) months  \nfollowing their promotion. However, the em-  \nployee will not accrue 1600 or job seniority for  \nthe time spent as a supervisor and they will  \nnot pay Union dues or remain on the call-out  \nroster. in order to maintain rights in their former  \nUnion job, they must be returned to non-su-  \npervisory status within twelve (12} months of  \nthe promotion. If they return after the twelve  \n(12)-month period, they will be placed in an  \nentry level position and for 1600 seniority pur-  \nposes will only be considered to be ahead of  \nother employees with less than:six (6) months  \nof Company Service.  \n(b) When former non-supervisory employees  \nhave held a supervisory position for twelve (12)  \nmonths or longer and are returned to non-su-  \npervisory jobs, for disability reasons only, they  \nwill be placed in such a manner as to be able  \nto perform meaningful work without adversely  \naffecting the job seniority or overtime of em-  \nployees in that line of progression. These  \ncases will be referred to the Disability Com-  \nmittee for resolution.  \nD. (1) A transfer in this Paragraph D is defined as a  \nchange from one job to another in the same job  \nclassification and progression line.  \n29  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \n(2) Employees cannot transfer to a job in the same  \nprogression line or change jobs to other progres-  \nsion lines during the first six (6) months of em-  \nployment. Employees will be considered for pro-  \nmotions in their line of progression during the first  \nsix (6) months of employment based on their abil-  \nity and job seniority. For posted job vacancies,  \nemployees with less than six (6) months\u2019 Com-  \npany Service may submit job bidding forms. How-  \never, only employees who have attained six (6)  \nmonths\u2019 Company Service must be given consid-  \neration for the posted job.  \n(3) Transfer requests shall be made in writing by  \n(4  \n  \nthe employee before a vacancy exists and em-  \nployees shall forward a copy to the Local Union  \nBusiness Office. For seniority purposes, employ-  \nees requesting a transfer will be considered on  \nthe basis of their job seniority in comparison to  \nthe job seniority of employees in the next lower  \njob classification in the progression line. Trans-  \nferred employees will retain their job seniority  \ndate for promotional purposes only.  \nEmployees with more than six (6) months Com-  \npany Service voluntarily requesting a transfer  \nwithin the same job classification and same pro-  \ngression line are restricted to one (1) transfer ev-  \nery five (5) years for each job classification. This  \napplies to all job classifications and all pro-  \ngression lines. No transfer requests will be al-  \nlowed across progression lines.  \nAn employee who was displaced and obtains a  \niob at a different facility within their  \nprogression line will have no tiie limits for hon-  \noring transfer letters as long as they are  \n30  \n(5  \n(6  \n(7  \nmeee?  \n\u2014  \nSe  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \nattempting to return to the facility they were  \noriginally displaced from. This would also ap-  \nply if they were attempting to return to any  \ncloser facility within their progression line. For  \nexample, if an employee was displaced from a  \njob at the Harrisburg SC, and obtained a job in  \nthe placement process at the Newport SC, he  \nwould be allowed to submit transfer requests  \nto either West Shore SC or Harrisburg SC with-  \nout the five (5)-year restriction.  \nEmployees in the Office Jobs Concept with more  \nthan six (6) months Company Service requesting  \nto change jobs to other progression lines must  \nenter those progression lines at bottom entry level  \njobs. For seniority purposes, employees chang-  \ning jobs to other progression lines will receive a  \nnew job seniority date effective the start of the  \nfirst pay period after notification of selection.  \nEmployees with more than six {6} months Com-  \npany Service transferring on posted job vacan-  \ncies will not be restricted to the one (1) transfer  \nrule. For seniority purposes, employees transfer-  \nring on a posted job vacancy within the same pro-  \ngression line will retain their original job seniority  \ndate. Employees who change jobs to other pro-  \ngression lines as a result of bidding on a posted  \njob vacancy will receive a new job seniority date  \neffective the start of the first pay period after noti-  \nfication of selection.  \nVoluntary return rights within the first six (6} months  \nof a job change shall be restricted to progression  \nline promotions and posted jobs. Employees who  \naccept a posted position at a location and vol-  \nuntarily return during their probationary period  \n31  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \nwill not be permitted to rebid the same job clas-  \nsification at that location for four (4) years.  \n(8) Employees entering Apprenticeship Programs on  \nor after August 2, 1982 are restricted from bid-  \nding into other Apprenticeship Programs after the  \nsix (6)-month probationary period has been  \ncompleted.  \nE. The Company may administer tests for determining  \nthe aptitudes of employees being considered for entry level  \npositions and for entry into formal training programs. After  \nsuitable training, tests of achievement and ability may be  \nadministered for the purpose of determining qualifications  \nfor progression within formal training programs, and to com-  \nply with governmental regulations.  \nEmployees will not be required to successfully complete  \ntests to retain a job classification unless periodic testing is  \nspecifically required as a part of a formal training program  \nor by governmental regulations. If an employee success-  \nfully performs a job for six (6) months within the past five  \n(5) years without having taken the appropriate entry test(s),  \nthis test(s) will be waived for this employee.  \nEmployees who fail a minimum entry test two (2) times  \nwill be restricted from re-testing for a period of six (6)  \nmonths from the date of the second test. If the employee  \ncan show the Company that they have made efforts to  \nimprove their skills, the six (6) month restriction will be  \nwaived.  \nEmployees who meet or exceed test cut-off scores will  \nbe considered to have passed the test on an equal basis,  \nand will be considered for job openings in accordance with  \nArticle V, Section 2, Paragraph A of the Labor Agreement.  \nThe confidentiality of all tests shall be preserved and  \nactual test questions, employee answer sheets and indi-  \nvidual test scores will not be released by the Company.  \n32  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \nThe Company will review actual test questions and results  \nwith employees upon request, for ail skill assessment tests  \nfor purposes of identifying strengths and weaknesses.  \nUpon request the-Company will continue its practice of  \nreviewing the :areas of strengths and weaknesses related  \nto aptitude\u2019 tests: with employees.  \nlf a question arises regarding test administration or the  \nvalidity of a test relative to the job in question, it may be  \nsubmitted through the Grievance Procedure of Article Ill for  \nresolution. It is further understood that tests and agreements  \non testing reached prior to August 2, 1982 will remain in  \neffect and for the purpose of filling job vacancies, the Com-  \npany may administer tests to determine job qualifications,  \nwhich will be discussed with the Union prior to implementa-  \ntion. Any resulting disputes may be submitted through the  \nGrievance Procedure.  \nIf an employee voluntarily quits, or was discharged  \nfor cause, and is rehired, he will not receive credit for his .  \nprevious period of Company Service. If an employee is re-  \nemployed within two (2) years after layoff, he will receive  \ncredit for Company Service and 1600 Seniority, but will be  \ngiven a new job seniority date.  \nG. Seniority will not be considered when it is necessary  \nfo rearrange temporarily an employee\u2019s duties to meet an  \nemergency.  \nH. The Company will notify the Local Union President  \nbefore the effective date of any promotion, transfer, demo-  \ntion or lay off. If a disagreement arises concerning the  \ndecision involving fitness, ability and/or senior-  \nity, such disagreement may be submitted under Articte [I] of  \nthis Agreement.  \nl The Company will provide the Union with monthly  \ncompuier updates of employee information as agreed to in  \nthe Memorandum of Agreement signed April 6, 1987.  \n33  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \nJ. If an employee, selected to fill a job vacancy, is de-  \nlayed in reporting to such job because the Company is un-  \nable to release him, he will be credited with seniority from  \nthe start of the first pay period after the notification of his  \nselection. {f the new job represents a promotion for the-em-  \nployee, the employee will receive the appropriate pay credit  \ntwo (2) pay periods following the start of seniority credit,  \nand will be considered on probation for a period of six (6)  \nmonths from the day the employee reports to the new job.  \nIn the event the new job represents a transfer or demotion,  \nthe employee will receive the appropriate pay credit and  \nbegin the six (6) months probationary period at the time the  \nemployee actually reports fo the new job.  \nK. Voluntary and involuntary job changes shall be handled  \nas follows:  \n(1) When employees voluntarily or involuntarily  \ndemote in the same line of progression during the  \n- six (6) months\u2019 probationary period, they will de-  \nmote to their former job classification at their former  \nwork location. They will receive job seniority in the  \nlower classification for all time spent in the higher  \nclassification. Employees voluntarily or involun-  \ntarily returning from a job in another line of pro-  \ngression during the six (6) months\u2019 probationary  \nperiod will return to the job classification at the work  \nlocation where they last satisfactorily completed  \ntheir probationary period. Employees voluntarily  \nreturning will receive no seniority credit in the job  \nthey return to for the time spent in the other pro-  \ngression line. However, seniority credit will be re-  \nsumed starting with the first pay period after re-  \nceipt of their written request to return. Employees  \ninvoiuniarily returming will receive seniority credit  \nin the job they return to for the time spent in the  \nother progression line.  \n34  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \n(2) When employees involuntarily demote in their pro-  \n(3  \n~~  \n\u2014\u2014  \ngression line after the six (6) months\u2019 probation-  \nary period for reasons other than displacements,  \nthey will return to the next lower job classification  \nthey are capable of performing satisfactorily, which  \nmay result in subsequent promotions for other  \nemployees in the line of Progression, unless a  \nvacancy exists in the lower classification. Employ-  \nees will receive job seniority credit in the lower job  \nClassification for the time spent in the higher clas-  \nsification.  \nWhen it is necessary to involuntarily return em-  \nployees to jobs outside their Progression line after  \nthe six (6) months\u2019 probationary period, consider-  \nation will be given to the employee's previous Com-  \npany Service and experience. New seniority date  \nfor progression line and/or department service  \nshall be established effective the date of the  \nreturn. If such employees are returned  \nto the job they previously held because a non-su-  \npervisory employee promoted to a supervisory  \nposition and subsequently returns within twelve  \n(12) months of that promotion, the returned em-  \nployee will receive seniority credit in the job they  \nreturn to for the time spent in the other progres-  \nsion line.  \nTo demote voluntarily after the six (6) months\u2019 pro-  \nbationary period, employees May request to be  \nplaced in a vacancy in a lower job classification in  \nthe progression line they held, un-  \nless the lower job was not in the progression line  \nwhen the employee promoted to the higher job. in  \nthis instance, the employee can demote to a posi-  \ntion they did not hold. if a vacancy is not available  \n35  \nL. Po  \nWhen  \nArticle V \u2014 Sec. 2  \nand it is possible to demote the employee to a job  \nclassification he satisfactorily held in the progres-  \nsion line through subsequent promotions in the  \nprogression line, with the approval of the Com-  \npany and Local Union Office, such a move may be  \ninitiated. For job seniority purposes, the employee  \nwill receive no seniority credit in the lower classifi-  \ncation for time spent.in the higher classification.  \nHowever, if the employee subsequently promotes  \nto the higher classification, he will be credited with  \nthe time previously held in the higher classifica-  \ntion.  \nWhen a vacancy occurs within a progression line  \nand employee requests for demotion and/or trans-  \nfer are on record prior to the vacancy, they will be  \nconsidered along with promotional candidates.  \nEmployees shall forward a copy of the demotion  \nor transfer request to the Local Union Business  \nOffice. For seniority purposes, the consideration  \norder will be determined by comparing their job  \nseniority in their respective job classifications. The  \nemployee with the greatest job seniority date will  \nreceive first consideration.  \nsting Jobs  \na vacancy exists and a replacement ig not avail-  \nable from the method of filling vacancies prescribed in Sec-  \ntion 2 of  \nthis Article V, the Local Union Chief Steward and  \nthe responsible Management representatives shall arrange  \nto post, for seven (7) calendar days, a notice of the vacancy  \nto the extent deemed necessary and receive bids for the  \njob.

Sick Pay |  \nA. Sick pay allowances will be determined by multiplying  \nan individual\u2019s number of full years of Company Service  \ncompleted, up to a maximum of thirty (30), times eighty (80)  \n_ hours, and subtracting from this total the number of hours  \n- allowed with pay for sickness or injury in the preceding seven  \n(7) calendar years and the current year to date. The net hours  \nderived from: this calculation, up to a maximum of 2400, .  \nrepresent the number of hours that may be allowed to the  \nemployee for time off due to a non-occupational illness or  \ninjury. The day an employee becomes ill is the date from  \nwhich the sick pay entitlement for that period of disability is  \n57  \nAnticte Vill \u2014 Sec. 1  \ndetermined. Therefore, when a disabled employee crosses  \nan anniversary date of Company Service or the date when  \nthe seven-year history under the Plan is updated, any addi-  \ntional entitlement is not available for the period of disability  \n_already in progress. However, the additional entitlement is  \navailable for future absences upon the employee\u2019s return to  \nwork.  \nB. To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must have  \ncompleted\u2019 a period of employment of six (6) months and  \nhave properly reported the cause of the absence in accor-  \ndance with established procedures. New employees who  \ncomplete their six (6)-month probationary period will be  \neligible to borrow forty (40) hours of sick pay from the  \neighty (80).hours that they will be entitled to after one  \nyear of employment.  \nC. All cases of iliness or injury must be bona fide. If there  \nis a question regarding the nature of the illness or injury,  \nmedical certification may be required. False claim for sick  \npay shail subject employees to disciplinary action.  \nD. Employees are required to furnish medical certifica-  \ntion of illness for all absences in excess of five (5) in a pay  \nperiod year.

Employees will be notified when they have depleted  \napproximately 80% of their sick pay and employees who  \n58  \nArticle Vill \u2014 Sec. 1  \nhave utilized their full sick pay allowance will be consid-  \nered for further sick pay on the earlier of the next anniver-  \nsary of their Company Service date or on January 1st fol-  \nlowing the adjustment of their seven (7) year history.  \nF The Company will pay the difference between the  \nemployee's full pay and the amount paid by Workers\u2019 Com-  \npensation for employees absent from work due to occupa-  \n\u2018tional disease or injury. The amount of time available for  \nsuch allowances will be calculated in the same manner as  \nbasic sick pay under Paragraph A above. When such allow-  \nances are exhausted, employees will receive Workers Com-  \npensation and/or Long Term Disability payments in accor-  \nance with the eligibility requirements of those programs.  \n_ (1) To be eligible for such payments, employees ab-  \nsent from work due to occupational injury must  \nproperly notify the Company of an accident before  \nthe end of the W-day during which it occurs, or at  \nthe beginning of the next W-day if the injury oc-  \ncurs during non-scheduled hours in the absence  \nof a supervisor.

A supervisor shall not do the work ordinarily per-  \nformed by a non-supervisory employee solely to prevent  \novertime work by a non-supervisory employee. This shall  \nnot prevent a supervisor from doing any type of work in an  \nemergency or for the purpose of training and instruction.  \nThis Section shall not prevent working supervisors from  \nperforming such work as has been a customary part of their  \njob in the past.  \nSection 13.

Genera!  \nA. The Company and the Union have agreed on a de-  \ntailed plan for employees who enter and return from military  \nservice, which meets the reemployment provisions of the  \nUniversal Military Training Act as amended by the Vietnam  \nEra Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. The  \nCompany will grant military leave and intends to treat every  \nemployee returning from military service, insofar as pos-  \nsible, as though there had been no interruption in his em-  \nployment.  \n79  \nArticle IX \u2014 Sec. 2  \nSection 2. Leave of Absence  \nA Employees who enter military service will be consid- 4  \nered to be on military leave for the period and under condi-  \ntions prescribed by law. Although the law makes no provi-  \nsion for employees entering the Merchant Marine, the Com-  \npany will give due consideration, with respect to leave of  \nabsence, to each such case. .  \nB. In order that employees entering the military have  \ntime off to settle personal affairs before leaving for mili-  \ntary service, they will be allowed time off with pay as  \nfollows:  \n(1) When enlisting or drafted as an active employee  \nfor the first time \u2014 up to 5 work days off  \n(2) Mandatory periodic training \u2014 no days off  \n(3) Call-up to active duty for less than 60 days\u2014up  \nto 3 work days off  \n(4) Call-up to active duty for 60 days or more \u2014 up  \nto 5 work days off  \nTime off with pay for employees who volunteer for  \nactive duty wiil be reviewed by the parties on a case-by-  \ncase basis. Each employee entering military service will  \nbe entitled to the same vacation allowance as he would be  \nif he were voluntarily leaving the Company. If he should  \nneed more time without pay for this purpose, his leave wiil  \nstart at a mutually agreeable earlier date.  \nC. An employee entering military service will be paid in  \nfull, for time worked and allowed with pay, on the day he is  \nreleased from duty with the Company or as soon thereafter  \nas practicable.  \nD. The entire cost of the Group Life Insurance of a par-  \nticipating employee entering military service will be borne  \nby the Company for a period of two (2) calendar months  \n80  \n_  \n=  \nA  \noe Article IX \u2014 Sec. 2-3  \non ' following the last calendar month in which the employee  \n;worked. At the end of \u2018such two (2) calendar months, the  \na Group Life Insurance coverage will cease. However, the  \n\u00a5/ employee's life insurance will be paid in the-event of his  \ndeath during the following thirty-one (31)-day period. Dur-  \ning such two (2) calendar months and during such thirty-  \none (31)-day period, he has the privilege of converting ail or  \npart of his Group Life Insurance, without medical examina-  \ntion, to a regular policy.  \nE. Employees who enter military service will have their  \nparticipation in the Retirement Plan suspended until their  \nreturn to active employment. Benefit entitlement for employ-  \nees who do not return to active employment will be deter-  \nmined in accordance with the termination of employment  \nprovisions of the Pian.  \nSection 3. Reinstatement  \n_ A. Employees who return from military service and com-  \nply with the reemployment provisions of the Act will be re-  \nstored to their former positions, or to positions of like senior-  \nity, status and pay, unless circumstances have so changed  \nas to make it or unreasonable. In addition, such  \nemployees will:  \n(1) Be credited with the time they were in military ser-  \nvice in determining their position on the salary  \ntables.  \n(2) Be given promotions to such jobs in the regular  \nline of progression as may have become vacant  \nduring their absence, provided that they are quali-  \nfied and would have been selected by Manage-  \n; ment as the logical persons to fill the jobs.  \n(3) If pay is based on salary tables, the promotion date  \nfor determining the salary table step will be the  \ndate or dates the employee who replaced the vet-  \n    \n   \n81  \nArticle [IX \u2014 Sec. 3 i  \neran was promoted. if such dates are not avail- 33 ot  \nable, the promotion date for determining the sal- ER  \nary table step will be the date the veteran starts in: a  \nthe higher job.  \n- If pay is based on wage tables, the pay will be the present  \nhourly pay for the job to which the veteran is promoted.  \nB. in order for an employee returning from military ser-  \nvice to be eligible for the benefits under this Plan, he must:  \n(1) Have left a position other than a temporary posi-  \ntion.  \n(2) Have a certificate of satisfactory completion of such  \ntraining and service.  \n(3) Be qualified to perform the duties of such posi-  \ntion.  \n(4) Apply for reemployment within ninety (90) days  \nafter he is relieved from such training and service  \nor from hospitalization continuing after discharge  \nfor a period of not more than one (1) year.  \nC. A disabled employee returning from military service if {  \n    \n\u2018t=  \n  \nnot qualified to perform the duties of his former position by )  \nreason of disability sustained during such service but quali- $  \nfied to perform the duties of any other positions will be  \nrestored to such other position as will provide him with like  \nseniority, status and pay or to a position which is the near-  \nest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances  \nin the case.  \nD. Group Life Insurance Plan:  \nAn employee returning from military service will be eli-  \ngible for the regular amount of insurance based on his an-  \nnual earnings.  \nE Retirement Plan:  \n(1) The time spent in military service will be counted  \nin determining eligibility, vesting and benefit  \nME pgs  \n82  \nArticle IX \u2014 Sec. 3-4  \naccrual. This affords the employee the opportu-  \nnity to receive the same retirement benefits un-  \nder the Plan as if there had been no interruption  \nin employment.  \nlf contributions were required under the Plan dur-  \ning any the employee\u2019s absence, the em-  \nployee will be able to receive contributory credit  \nfor that time provided the employee pays the  \nmonthly contributions which were not made dur-  \ning the leave.  \nF. Vacation and Longevity Allowance:  \nThe time spent in military service will be counted as a  \nperiod of employment with the Company in determining va-  \ncation and longevity allowance.  \nG. Attending School:  \n(1) Employees who decided to attend schoo! before  \nresuming work and so notify the Company:  \n(a) Will be given preference over other applicants  \nif they wish to work for the Company on leaving  \nschool, and  \n(b) If hired, will be treated as former employees  \nand the time spent with the Company and.\u00a7in  \nmilitary service will be counted as a period of  \nservice with the Company.  \nSection 4. On-The-Job Training  \nA The Company will continue its on-the-job training  \nprograms as long as there is a need for the training and  \nwill establish new programs as needed in order that  \nveterans may take advantage of the training provided  \nunder applicable laws.  \n(2  \n  \n83  \nArticle IX \u2014 Sec. 5  \n"], ["Article X \u2014 Sec. 1  \nSection 5.

It is not intended solely to provide severance, lay-  \noff or retirement opportunities for employees who have not  \nbeen affected by this process:  \nThe company will identify the job classification and loca-  \ntion of the excess position(s). The Labor Relations Depart-  \nment will give 10 working days notice to the Local 1600  \nUnion Office of any decision to displace employees as a  \nresult of a reduction, elimination or reassignment of work,  \nduring which the following procedures will apply.  \nNOTE: See the end of this Article X for a Flow Chart of the  \nPiacement Process.  \nSection 1.

If agreement is not reached, representatives  \n84  \n   \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 1  \nfrom the Local 1600 Union Office will make the decision  \nduring this 10-day period.  \nA Employees whose work has been eliminated or have  \nbeen bumped by this process may retire if eligible, elect  \nenhanced severance, select layoff or proceed through the  \nplacement process. Employees who retire will be eligible  \nfor benefits as described below. Employees will have 5 work-  \ning days from receiving retirement/severance information  \nto make a decision.  \n(1) Voluntary Early Retirement for Employees Identi-  \nfied in the Placement Process.  \nEmployees who are displaced, bumped or qualify  \nas volunteers for displacement will be eligible for  \nspecial early retirement benefits if they have at-  \ntained age 55 or over at any time prior to place-  \nment. Qualified employees will receive the follow-  \ning benefits:  \n-(a) One weeks\u2019 pay for each year of Company  \n(b  \n(c  \n~~  \n  \nService, prorated to the nearest full month,  \nand will be payable in the form of a lump  \nsum at the date of retirement.  \n100% of their pension benefit accrued to  \nthe date of their retirement in the form of a  \nsingle life annuity.  \nAn additional monthly supplemental pay-  \nment equal to 17.5% of their final monthly  \nbase salary from the date of termination  \nuntil eligibility for the limited SSI benefit  \n(presently age 62) has been reached.  \nThese payments will have a minimum of  \n$500 and a maximum of $1,000 per month.  \n85  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 1  \n(d) An additional monthly supplemental pay-  \nment equal to 4.5% of their final monthly  \nbase salary from the point of eligibility of  \nthe limited SSI benefit until the point of eli-  \ngibility of the full SSI benefit (presently ages  \n62 and 65).  \nThese payments will have a minimum of  \n$150 and a maximum of $250 per month.  \n(2) agreed that employees who voluntarily accept  \ntermination under the provisions of this special  \nprogram:  \n(a) May be asked to release the company from  \nliability for any claims of age discrimina-  \ntion under federal and state laws.  \n(b) Will retire on the first day of a month ap-  \nproved by the company as the effective  \ndate, taking into consideration the availabil-  \nity of qualified replacements, an orderly  \ntransition of duties and the employees\u2019 pref-  \nerences.  \n(3) Enhanced Severance for Employees Identified in  \nthe Placement Process  \nEmployees who are displaced, bumped or qualify  \nas volunteers for displacement, and who are not  \neligible for or do not elect to retire, will be eligible  \nfor enhanced severance benefits regardless of  \ntheir age or years of 1600 Seniority.  \nEnhanced severance benefits will be equal to two  \nweeks\u2019 pay for each year of Company Service,  \nprorated to the nearest full month, and will be pay-  \nable in the form of a lump sum at the date of termi-  \nnation.  \n86  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 1-2  \nIf these options reduce the number of employees to.the  \nappropriate level, no further action is required.  \n(4) NOTES:  \n(a) Reemployment rights will only apply to the  \nlayoff provision.  \n(b) Employees will be handled in the process  \nbelow in order of their Local 1600 Senior-  \nity. ~  \n(c) Ifa vacancy is available in the same clas-  \nsification at the same location, the em-  \nployee will be placed in the vacancy and  \nno further action is required.  \nSection 2. Box 2  \nCanvass the displaced employee\u2019s progression line at  \nthe same location for volunteers to retire/sever to create an  \nappropriate vacancy.

Employees will have  \n24 hours to accept or decline the promotion.  \nE. If a vacancy occurs at a higher level, fill through a  \nprogression line canvass. If a displaced employee declines  \nthe promotion and no one in the progression line wants the  \njob, then move to Box 6 without red tag.  \nIf someone in the lower job takes the promotion and the  \ndisplaced employee is willing to roll back, he will take the  \nlower job rate of pay through pay tapering.  \nF.

The resulting  \nvacancy must be at a location in a classification desig-  \nnated by the displaced employee. If a vacancy is created,  \nthe displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and  \nthe process ends.  \nOR  \nSection 5. Box \u00a7  \nIf Box 4 is not available or no location is selected, the  \ndisplaced employee may bump the most junior employee  \n(1600 Seniority) at the next closest work location where the  \nsame classification exists, in the same Progression line.  \nOR  \nSection 6.

Box 8  \nCanvass all employees for volunteers to retire or sever.  \nFrom this list, the displaced employee can select up to 5  \nprogression lines designating job classifications and loca-  \ntions they are willing to accept. If a vacancy is created, the  \ndisplaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and the  \nprocess ends.  \nA. Step 1 - In determining eligibility compare the dis-  \nplaced employee\u2019s 1600 Seniority to the 1600  \nSeniority of the employee in the progression line  \nwho would be eligible to promote to the vacancy  \ncreated by the volunteer. If the displaced employee  \nhas the 1600 Seniority and qualifications, they take  \nthe vacancy and allow the volunteer to leave.  \nB. Step 2 - If the displaced employee does not have  \nthe 1600 Seniority and qualifications to fill the job  \nof the volunteer, and has designated the next lower  \njob as one of their preferences, fill the vacancy  \nthrough a progression line promotion and then  \ncompare the 1600 Seniority of the displaced em-  \nployee to the 1600 Seniority of the employee in  \nthe progression line who would be eligible to pro-  \nmote to the resulting vacancy. !f the displaced  \nemployee has the 1600 Seniority and qualifica-  \n_ tions, they take the vacancy and allow the volun-  \nteer to leave.  \nC. Step 3 - If necessary, continue this process until  \nthe displaced employee fits somewhere in the pro-  \ngression line where there is a volunteer holding a  \njob designated by the employee.  \n90  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 8-10  \nIf the displaced employee cannot fit into any des-  \nignated job in the progression line, then there is  \nno appropriate vacancy created and therefore the  \nvolunteer cannot leave. |  \n(1) If Box 6 is available and the employee  \nelects to go to Box 9, there will be no red-  \ntag rate of pay.  \n(2) If Boxes 6, 7, or 8 are unavailable or no  \nselection is made in Box 7 or no progres-  \nsion line selected in Box 8, the employee  \ncan select from Box 9 at 100% red-tag.  \nOR  \nSection 9. Box 9  \nIf the employee is not handled in Box 8, he then moves to  \nBox 9 selecting a bumpable level job (B-04 and below) by  \n1600 Seniority or moves to Box 10.  \nA. |fBox 6 is available and the employee elects to go  \nto Box 10, the employee will assume the rate of  \nthe selected job through the pay tapering process.  \nB. If Box 7 is unavailable or no location was selected, or  \nif Box 8 was unavailable or no progression line se-  \nlected or no job was selected in Box 9, the employee  \nmoves to Box 10 with 100% red-tag rate of pay.  \nOR  \nSection 10. Box 10  \nBump LIFO* employee based on 1600 Seniority and  \nqualifications. The Union will handle employees in Box 10  \nwithin 30 days of the date the last displaced employee  \nreaches Box 10. Employees displaced after the 30-day clock  \nstarts, if eligible, can go through Boxes 1 to 9 and wait until  \nthe current employees in Box 10 are handled. Both parties  \nagree to cooperate in the administration of this process. All  \nemployees\u2019 pay and expenses will be paid in accordance  \n91  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec,10\u201411  \nwith the labor agreement. Employees not handled in Box  \n10, and who are eligible for a company offer as defined  \nbelow, will move to Box 11. |  \nSection 11. Box 11  \nExcept as provided in this section, no regular, full-time  \nemployee hired prior to May 18, 1998 who has attained ten  \n(10) or more years of 1600 Seniority, or hired after May 18,  \n14998 who has attained fifteen (15) or more years of 1600  \nSeniority, shall be laid off because of a reduction, elimina-  \ntion or reassignment of work, unless the employee has ex-  \nercised all of his rights under the placement process. In the  \nevent of such a reduction, elimination or reassignment of  \nwork, the employee will have access to the placement pro-  \ncess stated above with pay protection signified by the term  \n\u201cred-tag\u201d. If the employee utilizes the placement process  \nwithout securing a job, the company will select for the af-  \nfected employee a job, which may then be available any-  \nwhere within the bargaining unit. If the employee selects  \nthis offer, their pay will be red-tagged unless previously lost  \nin the placement process. In making such selection, the  \nCompany will consider the qualifications of the employee,  \nhis residence, his potential for training and contribution to  \ncompany efforts now and in the future and his 1600 Senior-  \nity and that of other employees affected. Moving expenses  \nwill be paid by the company in accordance with Article Vill,  \nSection 13. Company offers under this paragraph shall not  \nbe subject to Article Ill of the labor agreement.  \n*LIFO Eligibility Definition:  \nEmployees hired prior to May 18, 1998 with less than 10  \nyears of 1600 Seniority. |  \nEmployees hired after May 18, 1998 with less than 15  \nyears of 1600 Seniority.  \n92  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 12-13  \nSection 12. Notes  \nA. If the employee is bumped in Boxes 3 to 9, go to  \nParagraph A for processing.  \nB. If the empioyee is bumped in Box 10 (LIFO em-  \nployee), the employee can bump only those with  \nless 1600 Seniority than he has.  \nC. A displaced or bumped employee can elect en-  \nhanced severance/layoff/retirement at any step of  \nthe process.  \nD. Any vacancy not created by this process will be  \nfilled in the following sequence: 1) recall of dis-  \nplaced employee, 2} progression line promotion/  \ndemotion (includes transfers), and 3) post. If a dis-  \nplaced employee is the successful bidder and still  \nhas their red-tag, they will be awarded the bid job  \nat their 100% red-tag rate of pay or at the rate of  \nthe job if it is higher. If the employee voluntarily  \nleaves this bid job during the probationary period,  \nthe employee then becomes displaced and loses  \nthe red-tag rate of pay. If the employee involun-  \ntarily leaves the bid job, they will keep their 100%  \nred-tag rate of pay.  \nE Employees who reject the Company offer in Box  \n11 or are unable to select a position in Box 10 will  \nretain their Article Il rights.  \n. Section 13. Associated Issues  \nA. Recall Rights - employees who are displaced will  \nretain recall rights to their former progression line  \nfrom which they were displaced for a period of 4  \nyears as provided below. The demotion criteria  \nare no longer applicable for recall.  \n93  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 13  \nEmployees may be considered for vacancies de-  \nclared by the Company in either higher, equal or  \nlower job classifications in their former progres-  \nsion line, based on the following order of consid-  \neration:  \n(1) Same Job Classification - Employees who held  \nthe vacant job classifications prior to their  \nplacement in another progression line. Em-  \nployees will be considered based on their Lo-  \ncal 1600 Seniority ranking. Employees recalled  \nto their former job will have their previous job  \nseniority date restored.  \nHigher or Lower Job Classification - Fill through  \nnormal progression line promotion/demotion  \nrules. Fill subsequent vacancies through #1  \nabove.  \nEmployees with return rights may request to  \nbe placed in their former progression line in a  \nvacancy in a higher or lower job classification  \nthan the one from which they had been dis-  \nplaced if the vacancy is not filled through nor-  \nmal progression line rules. Empioyees will be  \nconsidered based on their Local 1600 Senior-  \nity. Recall rights will be satisfied if the em-  \nployee returns to a higher or lower job in the  \nprogression line.  \nThese opportunities remain in effect for a pe-  \nriod of four years from the date the employee  \naccrues job classification seniority in another  \nprogression line, regardless of the number of  \nopportunities extended. However, an em-  \nployee who refuses recall back to their former  \njob at their former work location will lose their  \nrecall rights.  \n(2  \n~~  \n94  \nAnicle X \u2014 Sec. 13  \nReturning employees who accept a lower.  \nlevel job in their former progression line will  \nreceive job classification seniority credit for  \nthe time previously spent in that job classifi-  \ncation and will retain their red-tagged rate of  \npay, if applicable.  \n(3) In the event the vacancy is not filled pursuant  \nto Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, it will then be  \nposted. If it cannot be filled through the post-  \ning process it will be filled through the reem-  \nployment provisions. |  \n. Reemployment - employees, who have been laid  \noff, shall have reemployment rights for 2 years.  \nAn employee who refuses a reemployment offer  \nto their former job at their former location will be  \nconsidered to be resigned.  \nRed-tag - The term Red-tag shall mean the  \nregular rate of pay shall not be reduced  \nfrom that which he received in his former job and he  \nwill receive all applicable pay increases or portions  \nthereof when the maximum rate of the job he is  \nperforming equals or exceeds such pay. Employ-  \nees who are red-tagged and subsequently bid to a  \nnew progression line will retain their red-tagged  \nrate if any of the jobs in that progression line are  \nequal to or higher than their current position. Such  \nemployees who return to their former job during  \ntheir probationary period will retain their red-tagged  \nrate of pay. If a red-tagged employee bids to a pro-  \ngression line/job with no equal or higher job, they  \nwill lose their red-tag and wiil assume the rate of  \nthe new job. Such employees who return to their  \nformer job during their probationary period will lose  \ntheir red-tagged rate of pay. Comparisons will be at  \n95  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 13  \nthe top step of the jobs to determine whether it is an  \nequal or higher level job.  \nBumping Criteria - see Exhibit A for the job titles  \nand qualifications required in order for employees  \nto bump into these positions.  \nProbationary Period - does not apply to jobs ac-  \ncepted through this placement process (including  \nprogression line promotions associated with this  \nplacement process). Hardships, involuntary demo-  \ntions and job swaps associated with this process  \nwill be handled between the parties on a case-by-  \ncase basis.  \nPay Taper - employees who have been demoted  \nand who are not red-tagged in connection with a  \njob change as a result of the placement process  \nshall have their salary reduced in 25% increments  \nevery 6 months for a period of 18 months in order  \nto reach the appropriate rate of pay of the lower  \njob. The first reduction will occur when the em-  \nployee physically reports to the job.  \n. Temporary Assignments - displaced employees  \nwho are temporarily assigned to a higher rated  \njob will be paid the higher salary after four (4) pay  \nperiods of reporting to the job. Displaced employ-  \nees who are assigned to an equal or lower job  \nwill continue to receive their current rate of pay.  \nResidence Requirements - employees who are  \nhandled under the placement process will not be  \nrequired to move to accept a job with residence  \nrequirements.  \nService - employees who are laid off and return  \nto employment will not have their Company Ser-  \nvice or 1600 Seniority adjusted for the time while  \non lay off.  \n96  \nArticle X \u2014 Sec. 13  \nJ. Vacation/Mini Vacation - employees headed for  \nlay off will have the option to retain or be paid for  \ntheir remaining vacation/mini-vacation allotment.  \nThe allotment must be utilized/paid by year end.  \nK. Testing - employees scheduled to be laid off can  \nrequest testing prior to lay off. In addition, employ-  \n_ ees Can request two (2) additional testing oppor-  \ntunities while on lay off by giving the Company a  \none-week advance notice. Such employees are  \nrestricted to taking a test no more than three (3)  \ntimes.  \nL. Time Limits  \n(1) Box 1, 2 and 3 - The employee will have a  \ntotal of five (5) working days to accept  \nor reject their offer after receiving the  \nretirement/severance information and/or all the  \njobs and locations available in Boxes 2 and 3.  \n(2) Box 4, 5, 6 and 7 - The employee will have a  \ntotal of two (2) working days to accept or re-  \nject their offer after receiving all the jobs made  \navailable through Boxes 4, 5, 6 and 7.  \n(3) Box 8 and 9 - The employee will have 4 total  \nof two (2) working days to accept or reject their  \noffer after receiving all the jobs made avail-  \nable through Boxes 8 and 9.  \n(4) Box 10 - The Union will handle employees in  \nBox 10 within thirty (30) working days of the  \ndate the iast displaced employee reaches Box  \n10.  \nBox 11 - If an empioyee with job security has  \nnot been handled through the previous boxes,  \nthey will receive a Company offer and will have  \na total of two (2) working days to accept or  \nreject this offer.  \n(5  \n~~  \n97  \nArticle X \u2014 See. 13  \nM.

Initial License Training & Qualification  \n(1) On the basis of need, demonstrated aptitude and  \nsatisfactory job performance, Nuclear Plant Op-  \nerators will be given the opportunity to enter the  \nLicense Operator Training Program.  \nEmployees entering this training will not be eligible  \nfor plant related overtime during the period of train-  \ning and will be required to make vacation sched-  \nule adjustments to coincide with the training pro-  \ngram schedule.  \nin order to successfully complete the License Op-  \nerator Training Program, the employee must:  \n(a) Successfully complete each course in the Li-  \ncense Operator Training Program. For each  \ncourse within the License Operator Training  \nProgram a final examination will be given. An  \nemployee who fails to pass any of these ex-  \naminations will be given the opportunity to pass  \na reexamination for the course, normally within  \nthree weeks of the original examination.

Temporary Assignments  \nField Services - Transmission & Distribution and  \nMechanical & Electrical  \nResource Management \u2014  \nMaterial and Transportation  \nFor Transmission & Distribution, Mechanical &  \nElectrical, Transportation and Material work assign-  \nments. within a region, if additional personnel are  \nneeded at a particular work location for normal  \nwork, the Company will retain the right to make the  \nsole determination where personnel are needed,  \nwhat classifications of personnel are needed and  \nwhat work location or work locations will supply the  \npersonnel. The most junior employees, by job clas-  \nsification/specialty, on the work location roster at  \n109  \nArticle Xl] \u2014 Sec, 2  \nthe supplying work location will be temporarily as-  \nsigned to fulfill this need.  \nFor normal intra-regional work assignments, the  \njunior employee in a job classification/specialty  \nwill be assigned within twenty (20) miles from his  \nregular headquarters. For subsequent intra-re-  \ngional assignments outside twenty (20) miles re-  \nquiring the same classification/specialty of em-  \nployee from the same work location, the junior  \nemployee will be reassigned to the location out-  \nside twenty (20) miles. This reassignment will  \nnot apply to any intra-regional assignments within  \ntwenty (20) miles nor to assignments outside the  \nregion. No roster can be both a sender and re-  \nceiver of employees of like job classification/  \nspecialty for intra-regional assignments. (The  \nintent of this paragraph is to assign the most |  \njunior employee by job classification/specialty  \nfirst to intra-regional work assignments).  \nFor normal work assignments outside a region,  \nthe most junior employee by job classification/  \nspecialty in the region will be assigned. No re-  \ngion can be both a sender and receiver of em-  \n_ ployees of like job classification/specialty for  \ninter-regional assignments.  \nWhen it is necessary to dispatch Local 1600 per-  \nsonnel on emergency inter-regionai assistance and  \nforeign utility assistance during scheduled or non-  \nscheduled working hours, or intra-regional assis-  \ntance during non-scheduled working hours, the  \nCompany will retain the right to make the sole de-  \ntermination where personnel are needed, and what  \nclassifications of personnel are needed and what  \nwork location or work locations will supply the per-  \n110  \non  \nArticle X!lI\u2014 Sec. 2  \nsonnel. Employees will then be selected by job  \nclassification/specialty in conjunction with their  \nposition on the call-out roster at the time they are  \nto be dispatched. However, for intra-regional emer-  \ngency assistance started during working or ex-  \ntended hours, crews may be dispatched intact if it  \nis deemed expedient.  \nContractors may be assigned to a region to per-  \nform unscheduled critical work for no more than  \nfive (5) days while employees assigned to those  \nrosters are shipped out.  \nField Services - Generation  \nField Services - Generation employees will have  \nwork rights on their plant rosters according to job  \nclassification seniority. Shipment of employees  \noutside of their plant roster will be according to job  \nclassification seniority. No plant roster or quadrant  \ncan be both a sender and receiver of employees  \nof like rates/skills. However, for assignment in or  \nout of Susquehanna SES, management will select  \nemployees based on NRC requirements, such as,  \nsecurity clearance, radiation exposure, literacy re-  \nquirements. The parties recognize the special re-  \nquirements needed to work at Susquehanna SES;  \ntherefore, due to an inability to gain access to  \nSSES, it'may be necessary to send employees to  \nan alternate roster. Contractors may be assigned  \nto aplant or quadrant to perform unscheduled, criti-  \ncal work for no more than five (5) days while em-  \nployees assigned to those rosters/quadrants are  \nshipped out.  \nThe parties recognize that situations may occur  \nwhere it is necessary to take immediate action to  \n111  \nArticle XIl \u2014 Sec. 2  \nrestore or maintain operating capacity of a gener-  \nating station. in these situations, employees may  \nbe required to remain at a work assignment out-  \nside their roster/quadrant while other employees  \nare brought in with like skills. Under these circum-  \nstances, the employees will remain outside their  \nroster/quadrant for a period normally not to exceed  \nseven (7) days and shall not exceed fourteen (14)  \ncalendar days. Those employees who remain out-  \nside their roster/quadrant during this period will be  \neligible for travel time and reasonable out-of-pocket  \nexpenses including mileage, meals, and lodging  \nwhere applicable for any days of the assignment  \nin excess of seven calendar days.  \nGeneral  \nEmployees will be temporarily assigned to other  \nwork locations in PPL\u2019s service territory as neces-  \nSary. For non-service territory work, the Company  \nwill provide the Union with timely notification of the  \nwork location and entire scope of the work. For  \nthis work, the Company will maintain volunteer lists  \nof employees and will conduct another canvas for  \nvolunteers for each job. For voluntary assignments  \noutside the service territory, the senior-most quali-  \nfied volunteer will be sent first. If sufficient volun-  \nleers are not secured, the junior people by job clas-  \nSiftcation systemwide will be assigned to the job.  \nEmployees assigned to this work will have the op-  \ntion to return home on a biweekly basis paid for by  \nthe Company. The parties also agreed to meet to  \ndiscuss enhancements to encourage people to vol-  \nunteer.  \n112  \nArticle XIl \u2014 Sec. 2  \nB. Specialties  \nThe recognized specialties that will be consid-  \nered for sending a senior person out or allowing a  \njunior person to remain at their regular work loca-  \ntion are welding, machining, electronics, equip-  \nment operation, and planning. The existing plan-  \nning work rules for overtime and job assignments  \nwill be retained. If an employee has one or more  \nof these specialties, it will be indicated on the work  \nlocation roster. Transmission line, distribution  \nline, and telecommunications specialty designa-  \ntions will be retained until employees are quali-  \nfied to perform the duties in the new jobs.  \nThe number of specialties will be designated for  \neach region and quadrant. Employees can apply  \nfor these designations and selections will be based  \non seniority and demonstrated ability. Employees  \ndesiring to designate a specialty will be given the  \nopportunity based on the need within a classifica-  \ntion at the region or quadrant. Employees will com-  \nmunicate their interest in a specialty by letter to  \nmanagement with a copy to the Local Union stat-  \ning their classification and the specialty desired.  \nUpon an anticipated need for the specialty within a  \nclassification, management will train the employee  \nbased on seniority in the classification of those who  \nhave submitted a request.  \nEmployees who desire to discontinue their specialty  \nstatus will submit a letter to management with a  \ncopy to the Loca! Union stating their intent to dis-  \ncontinue the specialty and reasons for the request.  \nRequests for certified medical reasons will be  \ngranted. Other requests to discontinue a specialty  \n113  \n   \nArticle XIl \u2014 Sec, 2  \nwill be granted based on securing a trained re-  \nplacement.  \nField Services - Regional Electrician  \nSpecialties  \nThe following applies to specialties within the  \nRegional electrical progression line. Acquiring  \nthese specialties will not affect the current job  \nranking seniority.  \nAll employees in the Field Services ~ Regional  \nElectrical Progression Line will be trained and  \nqualified within their job classification to per-  \nform work on underground systems (URD). URD  \nwork will not be considered a specialty.  \nAll employees presently in the Regional Elec-  \ntrical Progression Line, who previously held any  \nof the former Electric Repairman titles will be  \nconsidered as qualified to perform any work in  \nthat discipline with a Substation specialty.  \nAll employees presently in the Regional Elec-  \ntrical Progression Line, who previously held any  \nof the former Underground Repairman titles will  \nbe considered as qualified to perform any work  \nin that discipline with a Network specialty.  \nEmployees promoting or entering the Regional  \nElectrical Progression Line at the Electrician  \nClassification or above shall indicate a prefer-  \nence within their respective probationary time  \nframes.  \nFor initial staffing, the Company will identify the  \nnumber of Substation and Network specialties  \n114  \nArticle Xll \u2014 Sec. 2  \nneeded at each roster location. The Company  \nwill select additional employees for the special-  \nties based on the employees\u2019 preferred  \nchoice(s) by seniority. In the event the number  \nof employees has not met the number of needed  \nspecialties at a roster location, the most junior  \nemployee in that job classification at that ros-  \nter location will be required to accept the  \nneeded specialty.  \nIn the event the Company needs to increase the  \nnumber of specialties at a roster location, the  \nCompany will offer the specialty to those em-  \nployees who did not have their preferred choice  \nfor that specialty satisfied at that roster loca-  \ntion by seniority. If the need is not met, the Com-  \npany will canvass the employees at that roster  \nlocation for new choices prior to requiring the  \njunior employee to accept the specialty.  \nAn employee may have multiple specialties.  \nThese situations may be approved after all em-  \nployees in the job classification at that roster  \nlocation have had their first choice preference  \nfor a specialty satisfied.  \nThe Company agrees to maintain on a regional  \nbasis, for the duration of the labor agreement,  \na ratio of one (1) Leader to five (5) employees in  \nthe Regional-Electrical Progression Line, un-  \nless otherwise agreed to by the parties.  \nThe Susquehanna 230 Kv Switching Station will  \nbe considered in the Susquehanna Region for  \nwork rights.  \n1415  \nArticle XI! \u2014 Sec. 2  \nC. Overtime Procedures T&D and M&E  \nSeparate overtime rosters will be established for  \ncall out and cumulative overtime.  \nCall-Out Rosters  \nThe rotational call-out rosters will be used for:  \n1.  \n2.  \nEmergency work during non-scheduled hours  \nat the employee's normal headquarters.  \nTo dispatch employees on inter-regional assis-  \ntance and foreign utility assistance during  \nscheduled or non-scheduled working hours.  \nTo dispatch employees on intra-regional assis-  \ntance during non-scheduled working hours.  \nEmployees will be selected by job classifica-  \ntion in conjunction with their position on the cail-  \nout roster at the time they are to be dispatched.  \nHowever, for intra-regional assistance during  \nworking hours, crews may be dispatched intact,  \nif it is deemed expedient.  \nThe rosters will be grouped by high side, low  \nSide and support rosters.  \nT&D High Side \u2014 Lineman Leader, Journeyman Lineman,  \nTroubleman  \nLow Side Lineman, Helper Lines  \nM&E High Side Mechanical Leader, Journeyman Mechanic  \nLow Side Mechanic, Helper Mechanical  \nHigh Side Electrical Leaders, Journeyman Etectricat  \nLow Side Electrician, Helper  \nT&D and M&E = ~\u2014- Material Handler, Helper Material,  \nSupport Roster \u00a9 Equipment Operator  \n116  \nArticle XII \u2014 Sec. 2  \nCumulative Overtime Roster  \nThe cumulative overtime roster will be used for overtime  \nopportunities not covered by call-out  \n1.  \n5.  \nAlt overtime hours worked that are not associ-  \nated with the call-out roster (defined above) will  \nbe charged to the cumulative overtime roster, in-  \ncluding working through lunch and overtime  \nhours that are a continuation of the work day.  \nEmployees will be charged for overtime worked  \n. or offered. Time charged a person is determined  \nby the number of hours worked by the employee  \nwho works the overtime.  \nIf employees are assigned to a temporary work  \n_ location, they will remain on the cumulative roster  \nat their reguiar job headquarters only for weekend  \n. overtime opportunities if they are not working at  \nthe assigned work location. In addition, they can  \nbe offered overtime at the temporary work loca-  \ntion after it has been offered to all the employees  \non the regular roster at that location.  \nFor cumulative overtime purposes, a new person  \ncoming into this roster will be assigned the amount  \nof overtime equai to the average time of the em-  \nployees in that classification.  \nThe cumulative overtime roster will be updated on  \na daily basis.  \nD. Overtime Procedures for Field Services - Generation  \nField Services - Generation will follow the over-  \ntime procedures established for Transmission &  \nDistribution and Mechanical & Electrical.  \n117  \nArticle \u2014 Sec. 2-3  \nE Overtime for Transportation  \nThe 1993 Memorandum of Agreement that ad-  \ndresses Transportation call-out and prearranged  \novertime will remain in effect.  \nF Call-out Response  \nEach roster can elect to utilize a self-managed  \ncall-out roster with options to have a primary and  \nsecondary roster and the ability to use body swaps.  \nEmployees who exhibit a poor call-out response  \nshall be subject to Article VI, Section 5, Paragraph  \n"], ["J, and Article VIII, Section 2, Paragraph F, of the  \nLabor Agreement.  \n", "Section 3. Staffing  \nA. Temporary Furlough  \nIn the event the workload declines to a level where there  \nis a need to reduce the workforce, management will iden-  \ntify the excess employees by job classification and roster  \nlocation. The necessary reductions will be made in the fol-  \nlowing manner:  \n1.  \nVoluntary Furloughs: Employees at the identified  \nroster location may volunteer for temporary fur-  \nlough and they will be released on the basis of  \ntheir job classification seniority, with senior em-  \nployee given first choice. Second preference to  \nvolunteer will be given to employees in the same  \nprogression line at other roster locations and they  \nwill be released on the basis of their job classifica-  \ntion seniority, with senior employee given first  \nchoice. Such temporary furloughs will be for spe-  \ncific time durations and volunteers will return no  \nlater than the specified ending date. There is no  \nlimit on voluntary furloughs.  \n118  \nArticle XIl\u2014 Sec. 3  \n2. Rollbacks: If there are not enough volunteers, em-  \nployees hired after May 18, 1998, may either bump  \nthe most junior employee hired after May 18, 1998,  \nin their job classification and progression line or  \nrollback to lower positions within their progression  \nline based on their Local 1600 Seniority. If they do  \nnot bump another employee, they will be assigned  \nto an available Utility Worker position closest to  \ntheir home based on Local 1600 Seniority. In all  \ncases, the employee will assume the rate of pay  \nfor the classification selected. Such employees will  \nbe subject to furlough or temporary assignments  \nto other classifications for up to twelve (12) pay  \nperiods per rolling year until they attain fifteen (15)  \nyears of Local 1600 Seniority. .  \n3. Employees on furlough will continue to accrue  \nCompany Service, Local 1600 Seniority, and  \nreceive full benefits, excluding coverage for any  \ninjury while working for another employer.  \n4. If employees are on furlough or rolled-back in  \nthis process, contractors cannot be utilized in such  \nemployees\u2019 quadrant, region, or roster location to  \nperform unscheduled, critical work the Company  \nemployees would have normally performed for  \nmore than five (5) days during any furlough  \nperiod. If contractors are used and employees  \nare not offered the opportunity to return, such  \nemployees will be paid at the rate of pay for their  \nregular classification for all days that contractors  \nwork in their quadrant, region, or roster location.  \nB. Utility Worker Pool  \nThe parties agree to establish a pool of temporary em-  \nployees, Utility Worker, to replace contractors performing  \nBuilding Custodian, Handyman-Power Production, Handy-  \n\u20ac  \n119  \nArticle XIl \u2014 Sec. 3  \nman-Distribution, Groundman, and Laborer functions. This  \npoo! will also provide opportunities for employees cov-  \nered under Article XII when their workload declines and it  \nis necessary to temporarily reduce the work force. This  \nprovision will replace the use of Specific Temporaries in  \nArticle XIl.  \nNew employees will be hired to work as Utility Workers.  \nTheir Local 1600 Seniority will be the date of hire regard-  \nless of the number of layoffs and such employees are eli-  \ngible to bid on posted jobs while actively employed. In the  \nevent a period of layoff exceeds thirteen (13) pay periods a  \nnew Local 1600 Seniority date will be established. They are  \nnot eligible for benefits and travel expenses nor guaranteed  \nforty (40) hours per week. Utility Workers will receive the  \nsame employee benefits and entitlements as defined in  \nArticle V, Section 4, Paragraph A as Specific Temporary  \nemployees. an employee is bumped by an Article XiIl  \nemployee, they can bump other Utility Workers with less  \nLocal 1600 Seniority.  \nThe intent of this concept is to replace the contractors  \ndoing this work with Local 1600 employees. However, to  \nmeet temporary peaks for flaggers at a particular location,  \ncontractors may occasionally do this work.  \nWhen regular Article XII employees are assigned to this  \npool, they will be given the Utility Worker position closest to  \ntheir home by Local 1600 Seniority and will continue to re-  \nceive benefits and travel expenses in accordance with the  \nLabor Agreement.  \nUtility Workers on layoff will have reemployment oppor-  \ntunities before a new employee is hired into the Utility Worker  \nPool.  \nC. Temporary Promotions  \nEmployees will be temporarily promoted to meet Field  \nServices - Generation welding needs.  \n120  \nArticla XII \u2014 Sec. 3-4  \nD. Temporary Promotion to Supervisor  \nNon-supervisory employees may be temporarily pro-  \nmoted to supervisory positions in accordance with Article V,  \nSection 2, Paragraph C(1) a, b.  \nSection 4. Genera!  \nA. Jobs Postponed or Canceled  \nWhenever crews report for regular work and the job is  \ncanceled or postponed, they will be given First Aid, Safety,  \nor other instructions or other work, and will be allowed, pro-  \nvided they accept miscellaneous assignments, a minimum  \npay for that day equal to the pay for eight (8) hours at straight  \ntime rates.  \nWhenever crews report for prearranged overtime work  \nand the job is canceled or postponed they will be given First  \nAid, Safety, or other instructions or other work, and will be  \nallowed, provided they accept miscellaneous assignments,  \na minimum pay for that day equal to the pay for four (4)  \nhours at straight time rates. If the employee accepts the  \ncancellation of prearranged overtime and elects not to re-  \nport to work, the minimum compensation shail not apply.  \nEmployees who report for work and are not offered any other  \nassignments will be eligible for the minimum compensation.  \nB. Travel Time  \nTravel time both ways between work headquarters and  \nthe job will be considered time worked.  \nC. Short Shifting  \nEmployees who have their work schedule changed, per  \nthe Labor Agreement, will have at Jeast eight (8) hours of  \nrest at home. They will be released from their regular as-  \nsignment at the time they are notified. Employees who have  \ntheir work location changed will have at least eight (8) hours  \nof rest at home before reporting to the new location.  \n121  \nArticle XIl \u2014 Sec. 4  \nD. Safety  \nThe parties agree all employees need to be committed  \nto maintain an accident-free environment. No employee  \nwill be expected to perform work assignments for which  \nthey have not been trained or have an equivalent level of  \npractical experience.  \nWhen PPL employees perform work for others, they will  \nfollow PPL Safety Rules. In these situations, PPL Energy  \nControl Process procedures will be followed as closely as  \npossible.  \nThe President of Loca! 1600 shall select the bargaining  \nunit members of joint Safety and Health Committees.  \nWhen a lineman is working in the danger zone, a second  \nlineman will be at that location.  \nE. Training  \nFormal training will be provided to employees at each  \nlevel of the progression lines. Employees will begin training  \non the appropriate modules when they promote/select the  \nnew position. Employees must pass associated module  \ntesting in their current position prior to being considered for  \nfuture promotions. Failure of training modules is not cause  \nfor an employee to be removed from their current position  \nand employees who fail may re-test. Training will be com-  \npleted within four (4) years of the date of promotion/selec-  \ntion. If a vacancy occurs before the employee completes all  \nthe modules, he will not be denied the promotion.  \nF. Modified Duty  \nEmployees who are released for limited duty by a physi-  \ncian or medical specialist following a period of illness or in-  \njury will be considered for available work under the follow-  \ning conditions  \n122  \nArticle Xil \u2014 Sec. 4  \n"], ["Article XIlt-\u2014 Sec. 1  \n", "1. Modified duty resulting from an occupational dis-  \nease or injury will be provided if the employee is  \nable to perform satisfactorily.  \n2. Modified duty resulting from a non-occupational  \ndisease or injury may be provided if the employee  \nis able to perform satisfactorily.  \nEmployees who are on modified duty as the result of an  \noccupational disease or injury will have preference for any  \navailable work and for assignments closer to their perma-  \nnent residence.  \nThe rate of pay for employees on modified duty will be  \ndetermined in accordance with Article VIII, Section 11C. Work  \nassignment and training school expense provisions of this  \nAgreement will apply when an employee is on modified duty.  \nThe assignment of overtime will be at the discretion of the  \nCompany. This provision for modified duty will not apply when  \nthe sickness or injury is the result of willful intention to injure  \nones self (or some other person), by commission of any  \ncrime, or as a consequence of working for an employer other  \nthan the Company or working for remuneration through self-  \nemployment.  \n"], ["ARTICLE XIll  \nCUSTOMER CARE CENTER  \n", "Section 1. General  \nA. The parties recognize that transition to a non-regu-  \nlated energy market will require the Company to develop  \nnew facilities, work groups, job descriptions, rates of pay,  \nbenefits and appropriate work practices.  \nB. Currently, the Company is contracting out (outsourcing)  \nthe telemarketing functions while they explore and analyze  \nthe possibility to internally develop an infrastructure to sup-  \nport these functions.  \n123  \nArticle XIll \u2014 Sec. 1-2  \nC.

If reductions occur within the Customer Care Center,  \nemployees will have the option to bump within the Customer  \nCare Center by Local 1600 Seniority. The most junior  \nbumped employee will be laid off unless there are contrac-  \ntors working whose work they can perform or they can bump  \na junior part-time employee working in the Customer Care  \nCenter. If the person affected was hired prior to May 18,  \n1998, they can exercise their displacement rights in accor-  \ndance with X.  \nG.
