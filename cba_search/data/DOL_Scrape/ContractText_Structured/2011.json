This shall be made up of  \nthe names of employees in the bargaining unit who have made written request during the first  \nfifteen (15) days in January (to be effective from the first workweek in February until the first  \nworkweek in August) or the first fifteen days in July (to be effective from the first workweek in  \nAugust until the first workweek in February) of each year in which they state their wish to receive a  \nfull-time assignment, regardless of the hours or shift. Such written request shall be submitted to the  \ndesignated Employer representative. This request shall remain in effect until the following request  \nperiod or until assigned full-time.  \nWhen an employee who has been assigned full-time status schedule for the immediately  \npreceding twelve (12) or more weeks is terminated because of quit or discharge, or is transferred by  \nthe Employer, or when a new position of full-time 1s created within an existing store the job  \nvacancy created by such quit, discharge, transfer or new job creation shall be filled by assignment of  \nthe most senior qualified employee in the same classification as the job vacancy who has signed the  \nthen current \"full-time request\" list, when it is deemed necessary to fill the vacancy. When the new  \nassignment is within ten (10) miles of the store in which the employee is working the employee so  \nassigned shall be required to fill the new assignment regardless of hours, shift or store location  \nwithin the bargaining unit. In the event the new assignment is to a store more than ten (10) miles  \nfrom the store in which the employee is working, the employee may refuse the new assignment, but  \nmust so advise the Employer at the time the assignment is offered. It is understood, however, such  \nemployee who has made written request for a full-time assignment retains the right to revoke such  \nrequest by written notice submitted to the designated Employer representative at any time prior to  \n12  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \nthe time he is offered such full-time assignment. If an employee revokes such request, that  \nemployee cannot renew his request until the next regular request period.  \nThis Section is intended to maximize the number of hours a senior employee can work, up  \nto and including forty (40) hours per week, but shall not be construed to be a guaranteed workweek.  \nSection 32. All Purpose Clerks, Bakery Clerks, Non-Foods or General Merchandise Clerks  \n(exclusive of employees assigned as night stockers, and all probationary employees) may request  \nparticular weekly schedules, and schedules which have consecutive days off as may be posted, and  \nbe so assigned in accordance with their seniority within their classification within the store by  \nsubmitting such request in writing, provided they are qualified and available to perform the  \nnecessary work. An employee who has made such election as outlined above shall retain the  \nschedule, providing the schedule continues to be available. Such elections are to be implemented  \ncommencing the first Sunday of January, April, July, and October of each year.  \nAfter six (6) months of work on a night stocking crew, All Purpose Clerks shall have the  \nrights expressed above based on seniority to request particular weekly schedules.  \nNo employee shall be scheduled for less than twenty (20) hours in a workweek, if the  \nemployee is available.  \nNothing in this Article shall be construed to require pay for time not worked.  \nSection 33. When it is necessary to work additional hours, the additional hours shall be  \nassigned to employees in the same classification in the store who are scheduled for less than forty  \n(40) hours in the week, in the order of seniority, provided the employee possesses the ability and  \nskill to perform the work required and provided the employee is available to work the necessary  \nhours and has notified the Store Manager in writing of his desire for additional hours. Such written  \nnotification shall be furnished to the Store Manager no later than the close of business on  \nWednesday to be implemented on the following week's schedule. Nothing herein shall be  \nconstrued to require the scheduling of additional hours for any employee which will provide him  \nmore than forty (40) hours in a week, or five (5) days of work.  \n\"Additional hours\" shall include schedules made available by a terminating employee who  \nhas been assigned less than a full-time schedule and whose hours the Store Manager deems  \nnecessary to fill. The employee being assigned the additional hours shall not have the right to  \naccept such hours in part, but shall be obliged to accept the entire weekly schedule as written. It is  \nunderstood, however, each employee who has made written request for additional hours may  \nrevoke such request by written notice to the Store Manager no later than the close of business on  \nWednesday of the week proceeding the week involved.  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \nWritten requests to remain in effect until forty (40) hours is achieved or such request is  \nrevoked. Written requests are not transferable from store to store. Full-time scheduled vacancies  \nshall be filled as defined elsewhere in this Agreement.  \nSection 34. Reduction in Hours: When a reduction in hours is necessary within the store,  \nas opposed to a layoff in the workforce, hours will be reduced from employees in the affected  \nclassification who have not requested additional hours in writing as set forth elsewhere in this  \n- Agreement, before any reductions shall occur in the employee group which has requested additional  \nhours.  \nIf, after all part-time employees performing duties in the affected classification in the store  \nfor which the full-time employee is qualified have either had their hours reduced to 24 or have been  \nlaid off, it is still necessary to reduce hours in the store, the least-senior full-time employee in the  \naffected classification in the store must have his or her hours reduced to 24 before the hours of any  \nother full-time employee in the affected classification are reduced. For the purpose of reducing  \nhours of full-time employees in the Clerk classification, reduction will be made on the basis of three  \n(3) groupings: Night Stockers, Produce Clerks and all other All-Purpose Clerks. If a reduction of  \nhours has to be made among employees of one grouping, the least-senior full-time employee  \nworking in that grouping will be reduced unless he has ninety (90) days of verifiable experience  \nworking in one of the other groupings within the five (5) years preceding the date of layoff. In the  \nevent the employee has such experience or training, the least-senior full-time employee working in  \nthe grouping for which he has qualifications shall have his hours reduced. If the employee to be  \nreduced in a grouping is qualified hereunder to work in both other groupings, the least-senior full-  \ntime employee in both groupings will have his hours reduced.  \nSection 35. Employees who have requested additional hours, full-time status, or schedule  \nchanges in writing as set forth above, shall have until noon on the Saturday following posting of the  \nschedule to take issue with that schedule or his right to take issue shall be waived. Should he raise  \nsuch issue in timely fashion and should it not be resolved, it shall be subject to the grievance  \nprocedure set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of each employee to  \nmake himself aware of the schedule and any changes made therein.  \nSection 36. Layoffs: When a reduction in the workforce is necessary, as opposed to a  \nreduction in hours, the following procedures shall be used.  \nLayoff will begin in departments (checker, courtesy clerk, day stocker, night stocker, and  \nproduce for All-Purpose Clerk classification) in the classification to be affected in reverse seniority  \norder. The affected person shall be notified and given the following options: (a) Displacing the  \nleast-senior employee in the same classification in the store, if the affected employee is qualified for  \nsuch position, or (b) accepting the layoff.  \nLaid-off employees shall be recalled as needed, in the order of seniority, to jobs which they  \nare qualified to perform. The Employer shall not hire a new employee into a position for which a  \n14  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \nlaid-off employee is qualified and available to perform.

Said Pension Fund shall be used to provide benefit pensions for eligible  \nemployees of the Employer as provided in a Pension Plan, the terms and provisions of which are  \nto be agreed upon by the parties hereto; said Pension Plan shall, among other things, provide that  \nall benefits under the Plan and costs, charges and expenses of administering the Plan and all  \ntaxes levied or assessed upon or in respect of said Plan or Trust or any income there from shall be  \npaid out of the Pension Fund.  \nSection 73. Said Pension Plan and Trust Agreement establishing the Pension Fund have  \nbeen submitted to the United States Treasury Department and the United States Department of  \nLabor for the approval and rulings satisfactory to the Employer, that said Plan is qualified under  \nLR.C. Section 401, et seq. and that no part of such payments shall be included in the regular rate  \nof pay of any employee.  \nSection 74. If, for any reason, the United States Treasury Department and the United  \nStates Department of Labor withholds approval and rulings satisfactory to the Employer, the  \nparties to this Agreement hereto agree to negotiate other fringe benefits or wage increases in the  \namount equal to the cents per hour provided for in this Article for all hours worked at straight-  \ntime in lieu of payments into the Pension Fund.  \nSection 75. The Employer shall be represented by its employees, or some other  \nrepresentative on the Board of Trustees administering such Pension Plan. A copy of the Trust  \nAgreement and any amendments thereto shall be made a part hereto as if herein at length set  \nforth, when adopted.  \n(a) The Employer will direct is trustee to expedite the adoption of new prohibitive  \nemployment rules which restrict employment while drawing pension.  \n(b) Pension Protection Act (\u201cPPA\u201d). The bargaining parties agree and understand  \nthe Employer may be obligated to make pension contributions in addition to the base  \ncontribution rate specified in the Employer Contributions Section. The amount of any such  \nsupplemental contribution shall be determined as follows:  \n(1) Alternate Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan adopt  \nthe Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached hereto as Alternate Schedule, the  \nEmployer shall pay the contribution rate required in Alternate Schedule (modified only as  \nprovided herein) of one dollar and thirty-seven cents ($1.37) per hour effective January 1,  \n2010 (on December hours) which includes the rate of eight-two cents ($0.82) per hour  \ndescribed in the Employer Contribution section above and a supplemental contribution of  \n34  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \n(ii)  \n(iii)  \nfifty-five cents ($0.55) per hour. In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as  \nprovided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the  \nEmployer shall pay a total of contribution rate of one dollar and forty-four cents ($1.44)  \nper hour which reflects the sum of the contribution rate required in the Employer  \nContribution section, the supplemental contribution rate of this section and the new hire  \nbenefit contribution rate provided herein.  \nDefault Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan do not adopt  \nthe Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule, but instead adopt a legally valid \u201cDefault  \nSchedule\u201d within the meaning of the PPA, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate  \nrequired under the Default Schedule effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours);  \nprovided that in no event shall such contribution rate be payable prior to the effective date  \nof all of the benefit adjustments required under the Default Schedule. For example, if the  \nDefault Schedule benefit adjustments do not become effective until the start of the  \nRehabilitation Period under the PPA, the Employer shall not be required to pay the  \nDefault Schedule contribution rates until that time.  \nIf any required Default Schedule contribution rate exceeds the rate provided for under  \nsubsection (i) above, then each annual increase in the top pay rate provided for in this  \ncontract shall be permanently reduced by fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour, and ten cents  \n($0.10) per hour in the case of Courtesy Clerks, effective with the next scheduled pay rate  \nincrease following the implementation of the Default Schedule contribution rate. The  \npermanent reductions provided for herein shall continue year after year. It is understood  \nthat each annual top rate increase will be reduced until either sufficient reductions have  \noccurred so as to equal the amount of the increase to the supplemental contribution rate of  \nsubsection (i) caused by the implementation of the Default Schedule or until the date on  \nwhich the Employer implements contribution rates which are reduced to, or below, the  \ncontribution rates under subsection (i) above and in accordance with subsection (vil)  \nbelow, whichever occurs first, but in no event shall any such wage reductions made be  \nrestored.  \nLong Term Funding Policy Contribution Rates: In the event the Alternate Schedule  \nin subsection (i) above and the Default Schedule in subsection (ii) above are not  \napplicable during the term of this Agreement, the Long Term Funding Policy is  \nimplemented, the Employer shall not be obligated to pay a supplemental contribution  \nunder any other provision of this Agreement, but shall continue to pay the base  \ncontribution specified in the Employer Contribution Section plus a supplemental  \ncontribution under this subsection (iii) that shall not exceed fifty-five cents ($0.55) per  \nhour. This supplemental contribution shall be a contribution amount which has the same  \nproportionate value relative to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Long Term  \nFunding Policy as the value of the supplemental contribution of fifty-five cents ($0.55)  \nper hour under subsection (i) has to the value of the benefit adjustments under the  \nAlternate Schedule. This approach shall be accomplished by utilizing the following  \n35  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \n(iv)  \n(v)  \n(vi)  \n(vu)  \nformula: a) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy,  \ndivided by b) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternate Schedule,  \nmultiplied by c) the supplemental contribution of fifty-five cents ($0.55) per hour under  \nsubsection (i). These calculations shall be made by the employer consultants and shall be  \nfinal and binding on all parties.  \nFor example: If $5M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term  \nFunding Policy and if $10M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the  \nAlternate Schedule and fifty-five cents ($0.55) per hour is the supplemental contribution  \nunder subsection (i), then the supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) is  \n$0.55 times $5M divided by $10M, or twenty seven and one-half cents ($0.275) per hour.  \nIt is understood and agreed that the Employer may reduce the amount of any of the above  \nsupplemental contributions due the Trust (but not below zero) by the amount of any  \nsurcharge, deficiency or excise tax required to be paid by the Employer any time after  \nentering Critical Status. The supplemental contribution provided for herein shall be  \ndedicated solely to improving the funding of the Plan, and shall not be used to increase or  \nimprove benefits, and will be reduced or discontinued upon determination by the Plan\u2019s  \nTrustees, based on projections provided by the Plan\u2019s actuaries, that such supplemental  \ncontribution are no longer needed to support the level of benefits provided for under the  \nPlan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (vii) below.  \nAs a result of the Plan\u2019s having been certified as being in Critical Status for the Plan Year  \nbeginning January 1, 2009, the Trustees are authorized to adopt the Rehabilitation Plan  \nAlternate Schedule attached as Alternate Schedule hereto (if they believe it is appropriate  \nto do so). If the Alternate Schedule is adopted by the Trustees, it is hereby deemed  \napproved by the bargaining parties and automatically incorporated into this Agreement.  \nIn no event shall any contribution increases be required during the term of this Agreement  \nas a result of any annual updates or other changes to the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate  \nSchedule or, if applicable, to any Default Schedule.  \nIn the event the Trustees determine, based on projections provided by the actuaries for the  \nPlan, that, at any time during the term of this Agreement, an Alternate Schedule or  \nDefault Schedule with lesser contribution rates and/or benefit reductions would be  \nsufficient to reasonably enable the Plan to emerge from Critical Status by the end of the  \nRehabilitation Period, the Trustees may amend the Alternate Schedule or Default  \nSchedule in a manner that, to the extent possible, would restore reduced benefits and  \nwould reduce the Employer\u2019s supplemental contribution in an equal manner and amount,  \nbased on actuarial equivalence, provided that such modifications to the Alternate  \nSchedule or Default Schedule would still allow the Plan to emerge from Critical Status by  \nthe end of the Rehabilitation Period, taking into account to the extent legally permitted  \nany relief available under IRC Section 431(d). In the event the Trustees amend the  \n36  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \n(viii)  \nAlternate Schedule or Default Schedule as provided in this subsection (vii), then the  \nparties agree to adjust the supplemental contribution rates provided above to reflect the  \nlower rates in the amended Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. Notwithstanding the  \nforegoing, if, prior to the effective date of any benefit cuts specified in the Alternate  \nSchedule or the Default Schedule, the Trustees determine that (a) such benefit cuts are no  \nlonger required to avoid Critical Status or to have a valid Rehabilitation Plan, and (b)  \nsupplemental contributions could be reduced or eliminated, then the Employer shall be  \nfurther entitled to recoup the value of any supplemental contribution paid prior to the  \neffective date of the benefit reductions set forth in the Alternate Schedule or Default  \nSchedule. This provision shall apply regardless of the reason for the Trustees\u2019  \ndetermination, including a change in the law (e.g. a further extension of the Plan\u2019s green  \nstatus) and/or improved investment returns. The value of the contributions shall be  \nrecouped via a suspension of contributions in an amount equal to the amount of the  \nsupplemental contribution paid.  \nThe Board of Trustees is authorized to take all reasonable measures to cooperate and  \nassist in achieving the objectives set forth in this section.  \n37  \nGrand Junction Retail Clerks Contract  \nTerm: 05/06/12 to 11/14/15  \nALTERNATE SCHEDULE  \nRocky Mountain UFCW Unions and Employers Pension Fund  \nSchedule of Contributions and Benefits  \n      \n   \n        \n   \n        \nREHABILITATION PLAN \u2014 2009 PLAN YEAR ALTERNATE SCHEDULE  \n    \nContribution and Benefit Adjustments  \n\u00a9 Total contribution rate of one dollar and thirty seven cents ($1.37) per hour on  \nJanuary 1, 2010 (December hours).
