the decision of the Disputes Board, economic action may be taken by  
the other party.  
4, Should the Disputes Board, as established, be unable to reach a  
decision on the matter before it, or because of a deadlock (lack of

following manner: Within ten (10) working days after the dispute is  
referred to Arbitration, the parties shall ask the Federal Mediation and

and the other party shall! then strike one (1) name, and the parties will  
alternately strike names until there is one (1) name left. The final name

set the time and place for hearings, which shall begin no later than ten  
(10) working days after their selection, with the final decision to be

6. (a) An Employer shall be considered “delinquent” for a  
particular work month if its required report and payment for that month  
are not postmarked on or before the 15th day of the following month  
(the "due date"), irrespective of whether such delinquency is willful or  
otherwise.  
(b) If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work  
month (as provided in (a) above), they shall also be required to pay, as  
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 10% of  
the payment otherwise due for such work month, it being understood  
and acknowledged by the parties that actual damages are extremely  
difficult or impossible to ascertain and that the amount so fixed as  
liquidated damages is reasonable.  
(c) If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work  
month (as provided in (a) above), as to any or all of the Trust Funds,  
and if the report and the full payment due for such work month  
(including liquidated damages), are not postmarked in the office of the  
Fund Administrator on or before the 15th day of the month following  
the applicable due date such Employer shall (in addition to paying the  
full amount due) be required to post in the office of the Fund  
Administrator a cash or fringe benefits surety bond (in a form  
acceptable to the Fund Administrator) for each month of delinquency  
in form satisfactory to the Trustees and in the face amount of the  
greater of $20,000 or 125% of the amount due (or estimated to be due)  
for the delinquent month, which shall cover all of the Trust Funds and  
assure payment of all sums called for by this Agreement in the event of  
the Employer's subsequent delinquency as to any or all of the Trust  
Funds, and which shall be kept in force and maintained in the full face  
amount for a period of not less than 12 consecutive calendar months  
during which no further delinquency has occurred on the part of such  
Employer.  
Should the Trust Funds reasonably deem itself insecure in the  
payment or collection of fringe benefit payments by reason of the  
Employer's past delinquencies, insolvency, insufficient capitalization,  
and/or lack of assets subject to attachment within the State in which  
work is performed, then the Fund Administrator, upon submission of  
an affidavit of its Fund Administrator to Employer attesting to same,  
shall have the right to compel the Employer to post a cash or fringe  
benefits surety bond (in a form acceptable to the Fund Administrator)  
in the face amount of the greater of $20,000 or 125% of the total fnnge  
benefit payments reasonable estimated to come due within the six  
months following the date of Fund Administrator's affidavit. This bond  
may be required whether or not a delinquency exists at the time and  
may be required in addition to a bond posted for a prior delinquency.  
The Union shall refuse to supply persons and shall prohibit  
Employees covered by this Agreement from working for any such  
delinquent Employer who fails or refused to provide or maintain any  
bond under this Paragraph 6(c).  
(d) Iltustration of clauses (a), (b), and (c): If an Employer's report  
and payment for the January work month have not been postmarked  
before February 16, such Contractor becomes delinquent at that point  
and must pay the full amount due, plus 10%. If the report and the full  
payment for January (including the 10% liquidated damages amount)  
are not postmarked before March 16, the Employer must then post a  
$20,000 bond in addition to reporting and paying the full amount due.  
If, for example, the delinquency is $10,000, the required bond is  
$20,000. If, for example, the delinquency is $20,000, the required bond  
is $25,000. If a delinquency occurs in a subsequent month, an  
additional bond for that month is required and must be posted. Further,  
for example, if the Fund Administrator reasonably determines that  
future delinquencies are likely to occur, another, additional bond may  
be required to be posted in an amount based on a reasonable estimate  
of the following six months of fringe benefit payments to come due,  
even though a bond for prior delinquencies has been posted.  
(e) The delinquent Employer shall also be required to pay all  
costs of collection actually incurred by the Trust Funds, including all  
attomey fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter fees, and all other  
16  
fees, costs and disbursements incurred by or on behalf of the Trust  
Funds in collecting the amount due. Trustees at their discretion may  
reimburse (from the Fund) the Unions for picketing and bannering  
expense actually incurred by the Union in collecting amounts due the  
Trust Funds, which expenses shail be deemed to be costs of collection  
incurred on behalf of the Trust Funds.  
(f) Each Employer who is required to make payments to the Trust  
Funds shall promptly furnish to the Trustees, or the Unions, or their  
authorized agents, on demand, all necessary employment and payroll  
records relating to its Employees covered by this Agreement, including  
any other relevant information that may be required in connection with  
the administration of the Trust Funds. The Trustees, the Unions, or  
their authorized agents may examine such employment, or payroll  
records whenever such examination is deemed necessary by the  
Trustees, the Unions, or their authorized agents in connection with the  
proper administration of the Trust Funds.  
If any Employer fails or refuses to furnish its payroll records to  
the Trustees, the Unions or their authorized agents upon demand or  
refuses to afford the Trustees, or their authonzed agents reasonable  
opportunity to examine the same in accordance with standard auditing  
procedures, the Trustees or the Unions may enforce such by  
legal action, in which event all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees,  
court reporter fees and other legal costs and disbursements, as well as  
the auditing fees and costs incurred in conducting such audit, shall be  
paid by such Employer on direction by the Trustees. The Unions shall  
also have the right to take economic action to enforce such rights on  
behalf of the Unions and the Trustees and the Trust Funds shall  
reimburse the Unions for picketing and bannering expenses actually  
incurred in enforcing such mghts.
