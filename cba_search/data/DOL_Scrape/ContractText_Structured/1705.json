The terms and conditions of this Agreement, insofar as it affects the Employer and  \nthe Individual Employer, shall apply equally to any subcontractor of any tier under  \nthe control of, or working under oral or written contract with such Individual  \nEmployer on any work covered by this Agreement to be performed at the job site or  \njob yard, and said subcontractor with respect to such work shall be considered as an  \nIndividual Employer covered by this Agreement.  \n3. If an Individual Employer shall subcontract work herein defined, the work will be  \nsubcontracted to a subcontractor signatory to the appropriate Agreement with the  \nUnion. Such subcontract shall state that such subcontractor is or agrees to become  \nsignatory to an appropriate Agreement with the Union and will comply with all the  \nterms and provisions of said Agreement including the payments of wages, Trust  \nFund contributions and fringe benefit payments. A copy of the subcontract and  \nsignature shall be furnished to the Union upon request.  \nA, The term \"subcontractor\" means any person, corporation or other entity, other than  \nan employee covered by this Agreement, who agrees, orally or in writing, to perform  \nfor, or on behalf of the Individual Employer, any part or portion of the work covered  \nby this Agreement.

The Individual Employer will give written notice to the Union of any subcontract  \ninvolving the performance of work covered by this Agreement within five (5) days  \nof entering such subcontract and/or prior commencement of work by the  \nsubcontractor, unless such notice is prevented by emergency conditions, and shall  \nspecify the name and address of the subcontractor.  \n(a) If thereafter the subcontractor becomes delinquent in the payment of any  \nwages, Trust Fund contributions, or fringe benefit payments, the Union or  \nthe Trust Fund office shall give prompt notice of the delinquency,  \nconfirmed in writing, to the Individual Employer and to the subcontractor.  \nThe notice shall specify the name and amounts, if known, of the  \ndelinquency.  \n2008 - 2012  \nPile Drivers  \nAgreement  \nPage 5  \n(b) Said notification by the Union or the Trust Fund office shall be provided  \nwithin twenty (20) days of publication of the Delinquency List provided by  \nthe Trust Funds, or if in the case of failure to pay wages, five (5) days from  \nthe applicable pay day. If such notice is given, the Individual Employer  \nshall pay and satisfy only the amount of any such delinquency by such  \nsubcontractor occurring within ninety (90) days prior to the receipt of said  \nnotice from the Union, and said Individual Employer may withhold the  \namount claimed to be delinquent out of the sums due and owing by the  \nIndividual Employer to such subcontractor.  \n(c) Notwithstanding the provision set forth above, if the subcontractor is found  \nin violation of the hiring provisions of this Agreement, pursuant to the  \nprovision of Section IX (Arbitration of Disputes), and the Union is unable  \nto collect from the subcontractor the damages determined to be owing for  \nsuch violation, the Individual Employer shall then be liable for the payment  \nof such damages. The total of this liability, as it would apply to the  \nIndividual Employer, shall be for no more than five (5) days violation or the  \ntotal of the subcontractor's retention being held by the Individual Employer,  \nwhichever amount is greater.  \nIf the Individual Employer fails to give written notice as required in this Section I,  \nhe/she shall, until notice is received, assume liability for any violation of the terms  \nand conditions of this Agreement at that particular jobsite or job yard, as may be  \ndetermined by the Arbitration of Disputes. If the subcontractor is signatory or  \notherwise bound to an Agreement with the Union, the Individual Employer shall be  \nliable only for delinquencies as set forth in subsection 5(a) of this Section I for work  \non that jobsite or job yard. If the subcontractor is not in compliance with this  \nAgreement, then the Individual Employer shall be liable for any violation of this  \nAgreement on that jobsite or job yard.  \nIf the Union should make demand in wniting for exercise of this Section, the  \nIndividual Employer will require that any subcontractor of the Individual Employer  \nspecified in the demand will, if the employer has not already done so, post a surety  \nbond in an amount not to exceed $75,000.00 to cover payments of wages, Trust Fund  \ncontributions and fringe benefit payments specified in this Agreement. Failure of the  \nIndividual Employer to comply with this Section within two (2) days of demand will  \nmake the Individual Employer liable for the delinquencies of the subcontractor  \noccurring on the Individual Employer's specific job. The amount of the bonds  \nspecified in this subsection in no way affects the amounts specified for bonding  \npurposes elsewhere in this A greement.  \nThe Individual Employer has the primary obligation for performance of all  \nconditions of this Agreement. This obligation cannot be relieved, evaded or  \ndiminished by subcontracting. Should the Individual Employer elect to subcontract,  \nthe Individual Employer shall continue to have such primary obligation. Said  \nprimary obligation shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the Union's majority  \nstatus for the purpose of establishing the obligation of the Individual Employer to  \nbargain collectively pursuant to Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations A ct  \nas amended with the Union upon expiration of this Agreement but for no other  \n     \nTNO  \nRecs  \ne  \nstatute, rule, regulations, or law.

The foregoing shall  \nnot apply to an annual bonus paid to supervisors.  \nSubcontracts shall not be in compliance with this Section if the effect of such  \nsubcontract is to diminish, eliminate or circumvent the payment of wages, fringe  \nbenefits or the hiring hall provisions established by this A greement.  \nShould an Individual Employer party to this Agreement perform work or subcontract  \nwork covered by the Carpenters Master Agreement for Northern California, the  \nIndividual Employer shall observe the terms and conditions of that A greement.  \nRecognition and Hiring  \nA. Recognition:  \n1.  \nRecognition of Employer:  \nThe Union hereby recognizes the Employer as the sole and exclusive bargaining  \nrepresentative for their respective members, present and future, who are, or  \nhereinafter become members.

All members of the Employer shall be and continue to remain liable  \nunder this Agreement for and during the term hereof, irrespective of whether said  \nmembers shall resign from the Employer prior to the expiration date of this  \nAgreement, and such liability shall be deemed to have survived the termination of  \nsaid membership and remain in force for and during the term of this Agreement.  \nSuch former members shall be bound by any renewals or extensions of this  \nAgreement unless they give the Employer and the Union at least sixty days written  \nnotice prior to expiration date, or any subsequent yearly anniversary date in which  \nthis Agreement terminates, of their intent not to be bound by the new or renewed  \nAgreement.  \nThe Employer shall advise the Union, in writing, monthly of changes in the  \nmembership of the Employer.  \nUnion Recognition:  \nThe Employer and each Individual Employer expressly acknowledge that they and  \neach of them have satisfied themselves that the Union represents a majority of  \nemployees employed to perform bargaining unit work and agrees that the Union is  \nthe collective bargaining representative of such employees.

Every other person covered by this Agreement and employed to perform  \nwork covered by this Agreement shall be required, as a condition of employment, to  \napply for and become a member of and to maintain membership in good standing in  \nthe Union on or after eight (8) days of employment on such work with an Individual  \nEmployer or the effective date of this Subsection I] B, whichever is later.  \nMembership in the Union shall be available to any such person on the same terms  \nand conditions generally applicable to other members. This Subsection shall be  \noperative only to the extent permitted by Section XII of this Agreement.  \nIf Federal law is hereafter amended to permit a lesser requirement for union  \nmembership or union membership as a condition of employment than provided in  \nthis Subsection, the Employer and the Union will promptly enter into negotiations  \nwith regard to such subject.  \nThe Individual Employer shall not be required to discharge any employee pursuant  \nto this Subsection II B until a written notice from the Union of such employee's non-  \ncompliance with this Subsection, stating all pertinent facts showing such non-  \ncompliance, shall have been served upon such Individual Employer and two (2)  \nworking days have been allowed for compliance therewith.  \nThe Union shall place at the end of the journeyman registration list any person on the  \nlist who demonstrates a lack of journeyman skills, qualifications, or work ethic. A  \nperson\u2019s lack of skills, qualifications, or work ethic shall be based on the following:  \n2008-202  \nPile Drivers  \nAgreement  \nPage /  \n    \nAGC Fi  \nCALIFORNIA  \nASSOCIATED  \nGENERAL  \nCONTRACTORS  \nOF CALIFORNIA  \n2008-20  \nPile Drivers  \nAgreement  \nPage 8  \n     \na  \nAGC SS  \nCALIFORNIA  \nASSOCIATED  \nGENERAL  \nCONTRACTORS  \nOF CALIFORNIA  \nHiring:  \nat least three (3) different Individual Employers have documented in writing within a  \nnine (9) month period the person\u2019s lack of skills, qualifications or work ethic.  \nA person placed at the end of the registration list shall be referred to the Northern  \nCalifornia Pile Drivers Joint Training Committee for testing and evaluation. If the  \nTraining Committee determines that the person has the skills and qualifications of a  \njourneyman pile driver, such person shall be reinstated to his/her place on the  \nregistration list. If the Training Committee determines that the person does not have  \nthe required skills and qualifications of a journeyman, the Training Committee shall  \nprescribe a course of training and shall remain where they were placed on the  \nregistration list.  \nOnce a person receives three (3) letters, the person shall not be able to select any  \nclassification on the list for which he/she has received a letter, until he/she is  \nevaluated by the Training Committee. Written notification shall be presented to the  \njourneyman at the time of termination and a copy shall be sent to the union.  \nAfter evaluation, the person shall not be able to select any classification on the list  \nfor which he/she has been determined to lack the required skills and qualifications  \nuntil he/she successfully completes the course of training prescribed by the Training  \nCommittee.  \nThe Union has traditionally established and will maintain open and non-  \ndiscriminatory employment lists for the use of workers desiring employment on such  \nwork covered by this Agreement and such workers shall be entitled to use such lists.  \nIt is mutually agreed by the Employer and the Union to fully comply with all the  \nprovisions of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Presidential Executive Orders  \nNo. 10925, 11114 and 11246, and California Fair Employment Practices Act, to the  \nend that no person shall, on the grounds of age, sex, race, color, Vietnam Era  \nVeteran status or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the  \nbenefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination by not having full access to  \nthe contents of this A greement.  \nThe Individual Employer shall first call upon the Union for such workers as he/she  \nor it may from time to time need, and the Union shall furnish to the Individual  \nEmployer the required number of qualified and competent workers and skilled  \nmechanics of the classifications needed by the Individual Employer in accordance  \nwith the provisions of this Subsection II C.  \nIt shall be the responsibility of the Individual Employer when ordering workers, to  \ngive the Union all of the pertinent information regarding the worker's employment.  \nThe Union will furnish workers and skilled mechanics of the classification needed  \nfrom the hiring hall lists and upon Employer request in accordance with the  \nfollowing qualifications and conditions for dispatch:  \nPile Driver Classifications  \n1. Qualification for Placement on List:  \n(a) Certified Journey Pile Driver  \n(b) Current A pprentice Pile Driver  \n2, Employer Requests - Qualification:  \n(a) Certified Journey Pile Driver  \n(b) Current A pprentice Pile Driver  \n(c) Employer presents individual request for dispatch/hire as qualified.  \nThe Individual Employer in such an instance of solicitation must request such  \nindividual by name, and deliver by fax or otherwise in writing signed by a duly  \nauthorized representative of such Individual Employer. In the event all of the  \nconditions of this subsection are complied with, the Union must dispatch the  \nindividual so requested by the Individual Employer. Possession of a valid dispatch  \nissued by the Union shall be deemed sufficient evidence to the Individual Employer  \nthat the employee has, in fact, registered on the out-of-work list as required by this  \nsection.  \nWhen ordering workers of the skills required, the Individual Employer will give  \nnotice to the Union, if possible not later than 2:30 p.m. of the day prior (Monday  \nthrough Friday) or, in any event, not less than 17-1/2 hours, if possible, before the  \nrequired reporting time and in the event that, 48 hours after such notice (Saturdays,  \nSundays and recognized holidays excluded), the Union shall not fumish such  \nworkers, the Individual Employer may procure workers from any other source or  \nsources. If workers are so employed, the Individual Employer shall promptly report  \nto the Union, each such worker by name.
