The contribution for the Construction Advancement  \nProgram of Central Ohio (CAPCO) is that contribution  \nreferred to in Article XVII.  \nArticles VII and XIV govern how fringe increases shall  \nbe diverted from the wage package, if necessary.  \nSection 3. Hazardous Waste Removal & Lead Abate-  \nment Workers: For Laborers working in an exclusive  \nor \u201chot\u201d area with toxic or hazardous materials, one of  \nthe following personal protective equipment ensembles  \nwill be required for necessary protection against toxic  \ncontaminants. All of the ensembles increase the risk of  \ncertain types of worker-related injuries.  \nLevel A: (Wage Group 1) To be worn only in established  \n\u201csafe zones\u201d may consist of, from normal work clothes to  \nnormal skin protection such as gloves, face shields,  \ngoggles, coveralls, and occasionally respiratory protection.  \nLevel B:(Wage Group 2) Protective equipment includes  \na protective suit and an Air Purifying Respirator (APR)  \nwith the appropriate filter canisters. The ensemble is used  \nwhen contaminants are reliably known not to be hazardous  \nto the skin and not IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life  \nor Health) and correct filter protection is available. This  \nensemble offers adequate protection for many jobs. Heat  \nstress may be a problem due to the suit, and respiration  \nis more difficult due to the inherent restrictions to  \nbreathing in an APR. Also, normal job related injury risk  \nwill be nearly as high as for Level C equipment.  \n14  \noo \u2018ail  \nLevel C: (Wage Group 3) Protective equipment includes  \na chemically resistant splash suit and a SCBA or Airline  \nRespirator. This ensemble is required when the situation  \nis very hazardous, such as oxygen deficient atmospheres,  \nIDLH atmospheres, or confined space entries, but the risk  \nof skin exposure is not as great as in Level D situations.  \nThe Level C ensemble gives the second highest level of  \nprotection, but also puts physical stress on the worker;  \nprimarily heat stress, reduced vision, dexterity and  \nmobility directly attributable to wearing of the protective  \nequipment. Therefore, in addition to the hazardous  \nmaterial, the hazard of normal job related injuries is  \ngreatly increased.  \nLevel D: (Wage Group 4) Protective equipment is  \nrequired when the area has been known to contain  \nextremely toxic contaminants or contaminants unknown  \nbut may be expected to be extremely toxic and/or  \nImmediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH). This  \nensemble includes a fully encapsulated chemical suit  \n(moon suit), Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus  \n(SCBA), or Airline Fed Respirator, and various types and  \nnumbers of boots and gloves; cool vests and voice  \nactivated radios are optional equipment sometimes worn.  \nLevel D ensembles provide the highest level of protection  \nfrom contaminants but places the greatest physical and  \nmental stress on the worker. The claustrophobic  \nenvironment of the moon suit causes anxiety in most  \npeople, which greatly increases the already inherent heat  \nstress problems. Also, this ensemble reduces vision,  \nmobility, dexterity, and communication capacity, all of  \nwhich increases the risk of normal job related injuries;  \nie., slips, falls, caught between, etc.  \n15  \nSection 4. Hazardous Pay: Hazardous pay shall be at  \nthe rate of twenty-five cents ($.25) per hour added to the  \nclassification rate shown in Article V for the following  \nclasses of work:  \nA. All scaffolds at fifty feet (S0') or more above the  \nfoundations or grade level, whichever is higher.  \nB.

The Employer and the Union, therefore agree  \nto the following policy to insure all employees a safe and  \nefficient job site free from the effects of drug and alcohol  \nuse or influence.  \nAny job site is subject to massive and random drug  \nscreening. Any employee who is involved in an on-the-  \njob accident resulting in an injury to a person or property  \nor whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion  \nof probable cause or illegal drug or alcohol use impairment  \nwhile on the job site, may be required, as a condition of  \ncontinued employment, to submit to a test for alcohol  \nand/or illegal drug use which impairs the employee\u2019s  \nability to safely perform his/her duties on the job site.  \nSuch tests usually involve a sampling of the employee\u2019s  \nurine, blood or breath. Any employee who its asked to  \nsubmit to such a test will be required to sign a consent  \nform. If an employee who is asked to submit to a test  \nrefuses to do so, or refuses to sign the consent form, that  \nemployee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and  \nincluding discharge.  \nAll testing will be done by a reliable, established  \nlaboratory. If this initial test screen result indicates  \npositive findings, further testing of the same sample must  \nbe done to confirm the original findings, before the  \nlaboratory can report a positive finding. The confirmation  \n30  \ntest will be conducted by an independent accredited  \nNational Institute of Drug Abuse or College of American  \nPathology Laboratory and will utilize the more scientific  \nGas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry examination  \n(GC/MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential  \nbetween the employee, the Employer and the Union. The  \nemployee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wage and  \nfringes for time required for drug testing provided the  \nresults are negative.  \nIf the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee shall  \nbe granted a leave of absence for up to thirty (30) days  \nfor the purposes of drug and alcoho] rehabilitation. If the  \nemployee is eligible, such rehabilitation programs are  \ncovered under the Health and Welfare Plan, providing  \nthe employee confines his/her self to a twenty-four (24)  \nhour licensed rehabilitation medical facility.  \nThe employee shal] be removed from the Employer\u2019s job  \nsite. Upon presentation of certification of the employee\u2019s  \nsuccessful completion of the drug/alcohol rehabilitation  \nprogram, the employee may be restored to his/her orginal  \njob with the Employer.  \nIf the employee was reinstated, he/she shali for the next  \nsucceeding twelve (12) month period, present to the com-  \npany representative monthly certification of negative drug/  \nalcohol test results. Failure to do so will result in denying  \nthe employee the right to maintain his/her availability to  \nbe sent to a job site or if working, to be removed from  \nwork.  \nApplicants who are eligible to be referred to a job, and  \nare informed, prior to the referral, of the Employer\u2019s  \nrequirement to pass a drug test, and accept the referral  \nand subsequently fail the test, will be barred from re-  \nsigning the list until the applicant submits proof of a  \n31  \n\u201cnegative\u201d drug test, administered by a designated accredited  \nlab, before he or she can again be placed on the out-of-  \nwork list.
