The parties recognize the problems which drug and alcohol abuse have created in the  \nconstruction industry and the need to develop drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs.  \nAccordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to  \nmaintain a drug and alcohol free work environment, individual employers may require applicants  \nor employees to undergo drug testing. The parties agree that (fa testing program ts implemented  \nby an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and  \nManagement:  \n7000.t It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs,  \nnarcotics, or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on  \nthe Employer's job premises or while working on any site in connection with work  \nperformed under the applicable agreement.  \n7000.2 All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug test at the direction  \nof the Employer, but not later than five (5) days after commencement of work, at a  \nfacility agreed upon by the Employer and the Union. The cutoff levels for both the initial  \ntest and the confirmation test will be those established by the Federal Department of  \nHealth and Human Services. The facility where the sample Is tested will be approved by  \nthe Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The Employer agrees to pay  \neach applicant or employee who takes and passes the drug test for all the time it takes to  \nundergo the drug test up to a maximum of two (2) hours travel time plus lab time. If an  \nemployee fails the drug test and has time coming to him or her, the employer may  \nwithhold the cost of the drug test from the final check. Employers may use an oral fluid  \ntest or urine screen, solely as a type of pre-employment screening process. Testing  \nprocedures shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the products\u2019 manufacturing  \nspecifications \u00ab\u201cAvitar ORAL screen\u201d or Branan Medical Corp. \u201cOratect\u201d). Any \u201cnon-  \nnegative\u201d test results shall be designated as inconclusive. Employers may seek a urine  \ntest at a certified laboratory in accordance with the drug testing procedure set forth in this  \ncollective bargaining agreement to confirm results.  \n7000.3 Applicants not passing the drug test will not be placed on the Employer's payroll  \nor receive any compensation. Employees not passing the drug test will be removed from  \nthe Employers payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug  \ntest.  \n7000.4 The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs and alcohol  \nwhere the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from  \nperforming his/her job. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one (1) of  \nwhom may be a Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-disctiminatory  \nmanner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For  \nemployees who refuse to take a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph  \nhave been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been  \npositive for an unlawful substance.  \n7000.5 An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be  \ntested for drugs and alcohol where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the  \naccident resulted from drug usage.  \n7000.6 There will be no individual random drug testing by the signatory Employer.  \n7000.7 It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of  \nprescribed medication impairs the employee's ability to perform work, is a basis for  \nremoval.  \n7000.8 A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and  \nconfirmation test. The initial test will be an Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique  \n(E MIT). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test a  \nconfirmation test must be utilized before action can be taken against the employee or  \napplicant. The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (G  \nC/M S). The cutoff levels for both the initial test and confirmation test will be those  \nestablished by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. Confirmed  \npositive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long term frozen  \nstorage for a minimum of one (1) year. Collection and transportation of each sample  \nmust be done in accordance with the procedures mandated by the Federal Department of  \nHealth and Human Services.  \n7000.9 Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a  \nprogram at the employee's expense. When such program has been  \nsuccessfully completed, the Employer shall not discriminate in any way against the  \nemployee. If work, for which the employee is qualified, exists, he or she shall be  \nreinstated.  \n7000.10 Any dispute which arises under this drug and alcohol policy shall be submitted  \nto the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable Agreement.  \n7000.11 In the event an individual Employer is required, as a condition of contract  \naward, to abide by the terms and conditions of an owner's drug and alcohol policy, the  \nEmployer will notify the interested Unions in writing prior to implementing such policy.  \n7000.12 The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an  \nemployee found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found  \nunlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over  \nthe parties, the remaining portions of the policy shail be unaffected and the parties shall  \nenter negotiations to replace the affected provision.  \n7000.13 The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all  \nclaims, demands, sutts or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employer's  \napplication of the Substance Abuse Program.  \noe  \n   \n7000.14 The Employers will be allowed to conduct periodic jobsite drug testing on  \nconstruction projects until completion of work under the following circumstances:  \n7000.14.1 The entire jobsite must be tested including all employees of the  \nEmployer.  \n7000.14.2 Prior to start of periodic jobsite testing the Employer will notify the  \nUnion in writing.  \n7000.14.3 Analysis shall be conducted by a Federal Department of Health and  \nHuman Services certified lab.  \n  \nPAINTERS & DECORATORS  \nMASTER AGREEMENT  \nJULY 1, 2007  \nthrough  \nJUNE 30, 2011  \n--between--  \nINTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS  \nAND  \nALLIED TRADES DISTRICT COUNCIL #15  \nLOCAL UNION #159  \nAND  \nTHE PAINTING AND  \nDECORATING CONTRACTORS  \nOF AMERICA  \nSOUTHERN NEVADA CHAPTER  \nLAS VEGAS, NEVADA  \ntee wet aes  \nee peer mee etn Cdr me Ae nme 6  \nIUPAT District Council 15, Local Union 159 and Painting and Decorating Contractors  \nAssociation Master Labor Agreement: July 1, 2007-June 30, 2011  \nPAINTERS AND DECORATORS  \nMASTER AGREEMENT  \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nWITNESSETH  \n"], ["", "ARTICLE 1 \u2014- RECOGNITION  \nARTICLE 2 -
