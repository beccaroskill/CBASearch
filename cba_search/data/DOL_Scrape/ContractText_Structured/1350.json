The Contractors should simi-  \nlarly provide a report regarding their observations and  \nfindings at that annual meeting.  \nWhere a majority of the Labor/Management Trustees  \nthrough its various Labor/Management organizations deem  \nwise, said organizations shall engage in, support, finance,  \nor otherwise encourage, to the extent lawtul, litigation of  \nmatters that affect in any way the concems raised herein,  \nand the Union shall similarly act, where lawful.  \n55  \noY  \nthe industry, particularly the inherently fierce competition  \namong industry participants; and Contractors desire that  \nindustry employers and employees achieve and maintain  \n@ comparable and competitive environment regarding  \ncompliance to laws and regulations, wages and other  \nterms and conditions existing in the industry; and  \nIndustry monitoring and analyzing provides a direct bene-  \nfit to Unit employees by, among other things, creating a first  \nStep to reestablishing optimal stability and integrity in the -  \nindustry such that Unit employees can better gauge and  \nmaintain present and future employment opportunities; and  \nFree market competition depends on industry participants  \ncomplying to laws and regulations governing the industry  \nand policing the industry reduces the burden on taxpayers  \nthat such groups incur to curtail unfair, deceptive, dishonest,  \nand illegal acts; and  \nHistorically, monitoring and analyzing the industry has  \nplayed an important and essential role and has tended to  \ntie Unit employees to the Union and provided work oppor-  \ntunities for Unit employees consistent with CBAs. Fur-  \nther, evidence and studies have shown that cheating has  \nhistorically infested the industry. During the past two  \ndecades cheating continued to infest it, and federal, state,  \nand local public enforcement mechanisms have been  \nunable adequately to curtail this infestation for reasons  \nthat include a lack of funding and staffing; and  \nCheating has had and continues to have adverse and  \n_ detrimental direct and indirect effects on the industry and  \nparticularly on the Contractors\u2019 ability to employ Unit  \nemployees; and  \nA continuing need exists to attract and maintain a highly  \nskilled labor supply that understands the importance of the  \nintegrity and its effect on collective bargaining.  \n54  \nThe tarm \u201cindustry\u201d means the activity found within the  \nUnion's geographical area, and a reasonable extension  \nthereof, by which participants provide or perform tabor,  \nemployment, services, and contracting, or are affected or  \ninvolved in any way whatsoever by said labor, employ-  \nment, services, and contracting for work, as that term is  \ndescribed in the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d)  \npursuant to the \u201cJurisdiction\u201d section or traditionally per-  \nformed by the members and Unit employees.  \nThe term \u201cintegrity\u201d includes honesty among industry  \ncompetitors and participants, their adherence to laws and  \nregulations, area standards, a favorable perception by  \ngeneral public of the industry and its participants, the  \noverall absence of cheating, and improving the quality of  \nprofessional competence and service our industry pro-  \nvides to the community.  \nIT IS MUTUALLY AGREED THAT:  \nee  \nIndustry monitoring and analyzing benefits Unit em-  \nployees because it is directly related and absolutely nec-  \nessary for the Union to maintain its existence and position  \nas an effective bargaining agent of the employee unit and,  \nas such, provides Contractors with labor stability; and  \nIndustry monitoring and helps both the Union  \nand the Contractors better to: negotiate, administer, and  \nenforce their {egal and contractual obligations; and helps  \nthe Union better to represent employees of the bargaining  \nUnit while yet incidentally, helps gach  \nsignatory employer competing with other signatory em-  \nployers by providing, among other things, a more honest  \ncompetitive environment.  \nAnd, by monitoring and analyzing the industry, both the  \nUnion and Contractors can better negotiate because such  \nactivity provides both groups with a more realistic view of  \n53  \nADDENDUM A  \nINDUSTRY MONITORING  \n& ANALYZING CLAUSE  \nDEFINITIONS:  \nThe term \u201ccheating\u201d includes:  \ni) Non-payment or underreporting of workers com-  \npensation insurance premiums;  \nii} non-compliance with federal, state, and local  \nhealth, safety, labor and employment statutes,  \nregulations, and taxes;  \niii) construction contract procurement misrepresenta-  \ntions such as featherbedding and failure to abide  \nby federal, state, and local procurement statutes  \nand regulations;  \niv) violation of environmental! statutes and regulations;  \nv) violations of federal and state unfair and deceptive  \ntrade practices statutes and regulations; and  \nvi) any other meaning the parties, from time to time,  \nmight mutually agree reflects their intent.  \nThe term \u201cparticipants\u201d includes industry:  \ncontractor organizations, contractors, employees, em-  \nployers, workers, property owners and awarding authori-  \nties seeking to use or using industry participants,  \nconstruction managers, general contractors, sub-con-  \ntractors, independent contractors, architects, engineers,  \ninspectors, clerks, human resources managers, insur-  \nance companies (workers compensation Carrier, payment  \nbonds, etc.), developers, financial institutions, attorneys,  \nfederal and state enforcement agencies (OSHA, US DOL,  \nIRS, MA DOR, AG, DCAM, and etc.), labor organizations,  \nand etc.  \n52  \nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have  \nhereunto set their hand and seal this 16th day of  \nSeptember, 2000.  \nFor the Union, Local No.7  \nCHARLES WRIGHT, President  \nJAY HURLEY, Business Manager  \nJAMES COYLE, Business Agent  \nEDWIN WRIGHT, Agent  \nPATRICK McDERMOTT, Business Agent  \nMICHAEL J.
