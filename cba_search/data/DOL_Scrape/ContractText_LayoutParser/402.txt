member company to nonlongshoremen, are avail-  
able, such longshoremen will be assigned to such  
work, provided no union jurisdictional work stop-  
pages are caused and provided that such trained  
skilled longshoremen may be assigned to any skilled  
work they are capable of performing without limita-  
tion by reason of claimed specialization,  
(b) Where Pacific Maritime Association or its member  
companies have existing bargaining relationships,  
have granted recognition to, and have assigned work  
to bona fide labor unions as a result of such relation-  
ships and recognition; or where status quo excep-  
tions relating to other unions are now set forth in  
Section 1, International Longshore and Warehouse  
Union will not make any junsdictional claim or  
cause any jurisdictional work stoppage dispute in-  
volving Pacific Maritime Association or such mem-  
ber compantes with relation to such work  
assignments. However, if the Union obtains the right  
to represent and bargain for such workers and no ju-  
nsdictional work stoppage problems are created, the

nated.

ted under an exception provided for herein.

pute is resolved hereunder. >  
1.53 Any such dispute shall be immediately placed before  
the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee by the party at-  
tacking any claimed exception or proposing any change in an  
exception or any new exception. The Joint Coast Labor Rela-  
tions Commitiee decision shall be issued and shall be  
final unless and until changed by the parties or that Committee.  
The Committee may act on the grounds set forth in Section  
1.54 or on any other grounds. Both parties agree that its posi-  
tion on such a dispute shall in no case be supported by, or give  
rise to threal, restraint or coercion.  
1.54 Any such dispute that is not so resolved by the Com-  
mittee within 7 days after being placed before it, may be placed  
before the Coast Arbitrator on motion of either party. The Ar-  
bitrator shal] decide whether an exception should be upheld  
and may do so on the following grounds only:

on the part of the men to shift from one job to another when  
such move is ordered by the employers, Subject to the provi-  
sions hereunder ihe employers have the right to shift men  
and gangs, and men and gangs shall shift as ordered.  
3.131 A skill rated longshoreman may be shifted only  
to skill rated work suitable to his qualifications, (Note; See Sec-  
tions 4.32 and 10.32(e).)  
3.132 Employers may shift men in ship gangs to any  
other work including all dock and car work.  
3.133 Longshoremen working on the dock may be  
shifted to work aboard ships and may be shifted from their  
Original assignment on any shift to any work on docks, cars, or  
barges, except that longshoremen listed on port lists, as agreed  
by Joint Port Labor Relations Committees as men being limit-  
ed to dock work, shall not be shifted to work aboard ships.  
{a} This Section 3.133 as it relates to certain longshore-  
men being limited to dock work, is intended to im-  
plement reference in Coast Labor Relations  
Committee Meeting No. 28, December 27, 1961  
conceming the preferential assignment of dock work  
to ‘men either old or disabled.” It is understood that  
the Joint Port Labor Relations Committees will pre-  
### SECTION 3 GUARANTEES  
"pare such lists of men who are “old or disabled,” and  
who consequently will not be shifted away from  
dock work. The. Joint Port Labor Relations Commit-  
tees shall limit such lists to those in fact old or dis-  
abled and shall consider the normal volume of dock  
work in the port and the shifling of men from ship to  
dock, in order thai the number of men on preferred  
dock assignment lists may have sufficient work op-  
portunity to make reasonable hours of employment.  
(b) Included in such lists shall be machine operators .  
(bull drivers) in order that such men, not necessarily  
filling the classification “old or disabled,” shail not  
be forced off machines and put to work hand han-  
dling cargo on dock or ship. The period of time such  
machine operators have been doing such work shall  
be the major factor to be used by Joint Port Labor Re-  
lations Committees in placing such men on preferen-  
tial lists. This Section ofthe Contract Document shall  
nol be construed to mean a guarantee of work or pay  
if insufficient work is provided.  
3.134 Employers may shift men from shovel, freezer,  
andcalk shoe work to any other work including all dock and car  
work, When so shifted, the penalty cargo rate shall not prevail.  
The employer may not shift men dispatched for general cargo  
to shovel, freezer or calk shoe work.  
3.135 Fhe employer shal) have the right to peel off  
gangs at any time during 2 shift or at the end of a shift. The re-

the most work to do at their gear. They may be required to fin-  
ish the work at the gear of the released gangs. Under such cir-  
cumsiances the gear priority of the gangs released is  
suspended. Any gang peeled off under this rule cannot be re-  
placed at its gear by a new gang from the dispatching hall until  
the second subsequent comparable shift.  
3.1352 Gangs ordered to work under conditions  
which such gangs contend violate gear priority rules shall work  
as directed and claim(s) for such violation shall be presented by  
the union. If it is established that a gear priority violation did  
occur, then it will be automatic that the amount of time anoth-  
er gang worked in the hatch in which the gear prionty violation  
was claimed will be paid the gang whose gear priority was vi-  
olated on an hour for hour basis, unless the employer on whose  
ship the alleged gear priority violation occurred maintains that  
such incident happened for reasons beyond the employer’s  
control. The employer may then take that position and process  
it through the grievance procedure to the Area Arbitrator for fi-  
nal decision.  
3.136 The shifting of registered and limited registered  
men shall be carried out without bumping.  
3.137 Any gear priority rule will not prevent the  
shifting of men and gangs for the purpose of fulfilling the 8-

finish the second ship for shifting or sailing. These men or  
gangs will be ordered back to their original job during that shift  
or for the start of the next day's shift. If extended hours are re-  
quired to permit the second ship to shift or sail, the men or  
gangs will work up to but not beyond the end of the extension  
provided in Section 2.  
3.144 Men or gangs may be ordered to shift from a job  
ora ship which they have not completed but where they have  
run out of available work—e.g., a delay in arrival of cargo, a  
breakdown of equipment, ora ship that fails to arrive as sched-

be hired. If such operation converts during a shifl to  
use ofa basic gang no gang boss (in ports where used)  
shall be added during that shift, but if the basic gang  
structure is called back for the next comparable shift  
a gang boss (in ports where used) will be ordered.

Agreement making it an explicit condition that the Union and  
Employers are committed to observe this Agreement in good

11.4 Exceptions and Procedures for Health and Safety and  
Onerous Workload.  
11.41 Health and safety exception. Longshoremen shall  
not be required to work when in gacd faith they believe that te  
do sois to immediately endanger health and safety. Only incas-  
es of bona fide health and safety issues may a standby be justi-  
fied. The Union pledges in good faith that health and safety will  
not be used as a gimmick. The employer shall have the option  
of having the men who raise a question of health and safety  
stand by until a decision is reached or “working around” the sit-  
uation until it can be resolved, and no further work shall be per-  
formed on that disputed operation until the health and safety  
issue is resolved.  
11.42 Onerous workload exception. Longshoremen on  
cargo handling operations shall not be required to work when  
in good faith they believe that to do so will result in an onerous  
workload. The Union pledges in good faith that the onerous  
workload claim will not be used as a gimmick. The employer  
shall have the option of having the men claiming onerousness  
stand by until a decision is reached or “working around” the sit-  
vation until it can be resolved.  
14.421 When a man is directed to take his own relief  
without a man being assigned to relieve him, this does not au-  
tomatically present a question of onerousness of work or indi-  
vidual speedup for the men remaining on the job, regardless of  
the basic gang structure involved. A change in operations or  
manning to remove unnecessary men, or the handling of larg-  
er loads does not, in and of itself, automatically present any  
question of onerousness of work or individual speedup.

### SECTION 11 NO STRIKES, LOCKOUTS, AND  
### WORK STOPPAGES  
11.422 The procedure provided in Section 11.42 shall  
not apply on operations where the Association and the Union  
have agreed to changed operations or reduced manning under  
Sections 10.3 and 10.5. Ifclaims of onerousness are presented  
in such cases, they shall be referred to the Joint Coast Labor Re-  
lations Committee,  
11.4221 The foregoing Section 11.422 is intended  
to méan that agreements reached on changed operations or re-  
duced manning in accordance with the Contract procedures  
shall not be challenged as being onerous operations if no fur-  
ther change has been made following such agreement. In oth-

agreed manning if the operation is unchanged in al] respects.  
Any such challenges shall be referred to the Joint Coast Labor  
Relations Committee.  
71.43 General Procedures for Health and Safety and  
Onerous Disputes.  
11.431 The men must ask their steward to bring the  
question of health, safety or onerousness to the attention of the  
foreman or walking boss in immediate charge of the operation.  
The steward and his immediate superior (gang boss, hatch  
boss, etc.) are the only individuals who shall present the situa-  
tion to the foreman or walking boss,  
11.432 If agreement cannot be reached in Section  
11.43] the Business Agent shall be called. (The walking boss,  
gang boss or hatch boss and the Business Agent or steward,  
who are responsible and safety-minded individuals should be  
able to determine whether a condition is safe or unsafe.)  
11.433 If agreement cannot be reached in Section

11.451 The Area Arbitrator shail make an immediate  
ruling as to whether the original direction of the employer did  
or did not impose an onerous workload.  
11.452 After the employer has directed the men as  
to how work shall proceed on the basis of the Arbitrator's rul-  
ing and the work proceeds in accordance with the direction of  
the employer, the Arbitrator shal] make a further ruling that a  
bona fide question of onerousness of the workload did or did  
not exist. ,  
11.453 Where the Arbitrator decides or where agree-  
ment is reached in any one of the steps under Section 11.43 that  
to work in accordance with the employer’s original direction  
did not impose an onerous workload and the employer exer-  
cised his option to have the men claiming onerousness stand by  
until a decision is reached, the men shall not be paid for stand-  
by time and may be required to work beyond the time the shift  
otherwise would end to make up the time the men stood by.  
11,4531 Such makeup time shall not exceed 2  
hours, and the work will be performed at the rate applicable.  
The first 8 hours of time paid for, including “makeup” tame on  
the standard first and second shift and the first 5 hours of time  
paid for, including “makeup” time on the third shift shall be  
paid atthe appropriate shift rates. |f work goes beyond the stan-  
dard shifts as set forth in Section 2.4 in order to complete as  
much as possible of'a regular or extended shift, such work shall  
be paid at the appropriate shift overtime rate. When “makeup”  
time is worked, and the work goes beyond 5 hours without a  
meal period, the employees involved shall have the option of  
going toa meal on their own time and returning to complete the  
“makeup” time, or of finishing the “makeup” time without go-  
ing toa meal.

the original direction of the employer as to how work should  
proceed did impose an onerous workload and the employer ex-  
ercised his option to have the men stand by until a decision is  
reached, the men shall be paid for standby time.  
91.455 Ifthe Arbitrator decides or it is agreed at any one  
of the steps under Section 11.43 that the original direction of  
the employer does not impose an onerous workload and if the  
men are directed to resume work as originally directed, any  
failure to resume work as directed shall be the cause to remove  
the men from the payroll as of the time the men were directed  
by the employer to stand by if the employer had not directed  
them to “work around” the situation, or as of the time the men  
fail to resume work as directed.

tion and adjudication of on the job disputes, requires that work  
shall be performed in accordance with specific provisions of  
the Agreement, or if the matter is not covered by the Agree-  
ment, work shall be continued as directed by the employer. Ex-  
ceptions to this arise only where longshoremen in good faith  
believe that to do so is to immediately endanger health and  
safety or in good faith believe that to do so imposes an onerous  
workload.

payroll for cause is not disturbed.  
11.463 Should the Arbitrator rule that the issue of  
health or safety or onerousness was raised as a gimmick, the  
Employers may process the matter through the grievance pro-

15.3 The Employers shall have the right to propose changes  
in working and dispatching rules that they claim are in conflict  
with the intent of provistons incorporated in this Agreement.  
The Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee may refer pro-  
posed changes that are of only local significance to the local  
Jevel for negotiation. Any such change agreed to at the local  
level must be approved at the Coast level before being put into  
operation. Any proposal referred to the local level and not re-  
solved within 30 days thereafter shall automatically return to  
the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee.

beneficial, the responsibility of the parties in respect thereto  
shall be as follows:  
16.11 The Union and the Employers will abide by the rules  
- get forth in the existing Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code  
which shall be applicable in all ports covered by the Agree-  
ment.

working conditions and comply with all safety rules.  
16.13 Each individual employer wil] continue to furnish  
protective clothing or devices as he did on October 18, 1960,  
even though not specifically required by the Pacific Coast  
Marine Safety Code. At the local level the parties will from  
time to time review the question of protective clothing and  
devices and arrive at and maintain an orderly procedure for  
the issuance, safeguarding and return of the items furnished by  
the employers.  
16.14 The Employers will maintain, direct and administer  
an adequate accident prevention program in keeping with  
changing conditions in the industry.  
16,15 The Union will cooperate in this program and de-  
velop and maintain procedures to influence all longshoremen  
to cooperate in every way that will help prevent industrial ac-  
cidents and minimize injuries when accidents occur.

### SECTION 17 JOINT FELATIONS COMMITTEES, ADMINISTRATION  
### OF AGREEMENT, AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES  
16.16 The employees individually must comply with all  
safety rules and cooperate with management in the carrying  
out of the accident prevention program.  
16.17 An employee who is injured and claims two PMA  
employers are in dispute over who is responsible for his work-  
men’s compensation claim, may request the Joint Coast Labor  
Relations Committee to assist the employee in securing a de-  
termination as to which employer is to make advance pay-  
ments until the dispute is resolved. The JCLRC will not  
function to determine which employer, if any, is liable.  
16.2 To make effective the above statements and promote on  
(he job accident prevention, employer-employee committees  
will be established in each port. These committees will consist  
numbers ofemployer and employee representatives at  
the job level. Each category of employees should be represent-  
ed. Employers’ representatives should be from the superviso-  
ry level. The purpose of the committees will be to obtain the  
interest of the men in accident prevention by making them re-  
alize that they have a part in the program, to direct their atten-  
tion to the rea! causes of accidents and provide a means for  
making practical use of the intimate knowledge of working  
conditions and practices of the men on the job. It is further in-  
tended that this program will produce mutually practical and  
effective recommendations regarding corrections of accident-  
producing circumstances and conditions.

tion in an informal hearing; such referral may be prior to for-  
mal] disagreement in any Joint Labor Relations Committee or  
upon failure to agree on the question in the Joint Area Labor  
Relations Committee. Such hearing may be ex parte if either  
party fails or refuses to participate, provided that the arbitrator  
may temporarily delay an ex parte hearing to immedi-  
ate bona fide efforts to setile an issue without a hearing.  
17.62 The arbitrator shall act with his powers limited  
strictly to the application and interpretation of the Agreement  
as written. The parties shall have the ight to present such views  
as they wish to the arbitrator, but if shall not be necessary to  
have a shorthand or stenotype reporter present to report the  
proceedings nor shali employment of counsel be necessary.  
The arbitrator, on this basis, shal] promptly issue an oral inter-  
im ruling with respect to the grievance or dispute and thereafter  
confirm it in writing. An intenm ruling shall be binding on the  
parties regarding the particular issue on the particular ship on  
the particular occasion but shail not be a precedent for other  
cases. Any interim ruling shall be binding unless reversed by a  
contrary decision after a formal hearing.  
17.63 if either party is dissatisfied with the interim  
ruling, the question shall be immediately referred at the request  
of such party to the arbitrator for hearing and decision in  
accordance with the normal procedure under Section 17.5 of  
this Agreement, the arbitrator shall then proceed as if there  
had been a failure to agree on the question by the Joint Port  
Labor Relations Committee, provided that the arbitrator  
may temporarily delay a hearing to permit prompt bona fide  
efforts to settle the question in the Port or Area Joint Labor  
Relations Committee.  
17.64 The use of the informal procedure leading to an  
intenm ruling can be waived by consent of both parties with  
respect to any particular dispute or grievance. If at the begin-  
92  
### SECTION 17 JOINT LABOR RELATIONS COMMITTEES, ADMINISTRATION  
### - OF AGREEMENT, AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES  
ning of the informal procedure either party establishes a good  
faith claim that an issue, other than a dispute with respect to  
Section 11, is of general significance or that the formal proce-  
dure will be necessary to settle such issue, the arbitrator shall  
rule that the informal procedure be bypassed regarding such is-  
sue. In the absence of such waiver or decision to bypass, the ar-  
bitrator shall hold an informal hearing and issue an interim  
ruling regarding the dispute in accordance with the procedure  
set forth above.  
17.7 Discipline by return to the dispatching hall.  
17.71 The employer shall have the right to return to  
the dispatching hall any man (or to send home any nonregis-  
tered man) for incompetence, insubordination or failure to per-  
form the work as required in conformance with the provisions  
of this Agreement.  
17.72 Such longshorernan shall not be dispatched to such  
employer until his case shall have been heard and disposed of  
before the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee, and no other  
employer shall refuse employment to such longshoreman on  
the basis of such return to the dispatch hall.  
17.73 [fany man feels that he has been unjustly returned to  
the dispatching hall or dealt with, his grievance shal! be taken  
up as provided in Section 17.2 beginning with Section 17.23.  
17.74 Incase of return to the dispatching hall] without suf-  
ficient cause, the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee may  
order payment for lost time or reinstatement with or without  
payment for lost time.  
17.75 When returns a gang to the dispatching  
hall for cause, its gear priority terminates and such employer  
may carry on work at the hatch or gear involved without delay.

17.512 The Coast Arbitrator shall be selected by the  
Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee fo serve a term coex-  
tensive with the term of the Agreement. Fhe Coast Arbitrator  
may be reappointed for the term of the next Agreement by mu-  
tual agreement of the Parties. The Coasi Arbitrator shall be a  
highly qualified neutral arbitrator with maritime experience,  
located on the West Coast. If the Committee fails to agree on  
the selection of the Coast Arbitrator, the individual shail be se-  
lected by a 6-person panel of prominent industry representa-  
tives: 3 selected by the Union and 3 selected by the Employers.  
17.5121 Ifafter thirty (30) days, the Panel is unable  
to select a Coast Arbitrator, the Panel shall submit to the Fed- -  
eral Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) a request for  
a list of seven (7) highly qualified neutral arbitrators with mar-  
itime experience, located on the West Coast. If the Union and  
the Employer representatives agree that the list is unaccept-  
able, they may jointly request that the FMCS provide a second  
list. In the event, the Parties cannot mutually select a Coast Ar-  
bitrator from the FMCS Panel, the selection shall be deter-  
mined by astriking process. The first strike shal] be determined  
by a coin flip. The Party that correctly calls the coin flip shall  
have the choice of striking first or last.  
Note: John Kagel will succeed Sam Kagel as Coast  
Arbitrator upon the effective date of this contract (February L,  
2003). It is agreed that since PMA nominated John Kagel, in  
the event a FMCS Panel is required to select the successor to  
John Kagel, the Union shall have the choice of a first or last  
strike. Thereafter, the procedure of coin flip set forth in Section  
17.5121 shall apply.

arising under the Agreement including cases dealing with the  
resumption or continuation of work.  
17.53 Arbitrators’ decisions must be based upon the show-  
ing of facts and their application under the specific provisions  
ofthe written Agreement and be expressly confined to, and ex-  
tend only to, the particular issue in dispute. The arbitrators  
shall have power to pass upon any and all objections to their ju-  
risdiction. If an arbitrator holds that a particular dispute does  
not arise under the Agreement, then such dispute shall be sub-  
ject to arbitration only by mutual consent.  
17.54 In the event the parties agree that an arbitrator has  
exceeded his authority and jurisdiction or that he is involved in  
the industry in any other position of interest which is in conflict  
with his authority and jurisdiction, he shalt be disqualified for  
any further service.  
17.55 All decisions of the arbitrators, except as provided  
in Sections 17.261 and 17.6, shalt be final and binding upon all  
parties. Decisions shall be in writing signed by the arbitrator  
and delivered to the respective parties.

terim or formal, can be appealed unless it is observed and/or  
implemented.

tion 13, the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee shal] extend  
the time for filing of such claim beyond the time established in  
Section 17,41 whenever such extension is necessary because  
the period of limitation otherwise applicable is determined to  
be unlawful or because in the judgment of the Committe in the  
exercise of its sound discretion, such an extension is otherwise  
necessary to prevent inequity but in no event shall the time for  
filing of such claims be extended beyond 6 months from the  
date of the occurrence of the alleged discnmination.  
17,42 Either the Employers, the Union or the man in-

Exceptions

continues the 35¢ straight time and 52'/:¢ overtime  
penalties for unusually dusty, and 85¢ straight time  
and $1.275 overtime penalties for extremely dusty,  
fine, dry concentrates, but limits the application of

commodity handled at Tacoma only.  
The Employers have the right to protest the applica-  
bility of any penalty based on the characteristics of the com-  
modity or the methods of operation, whether on alocalbasisor -  
coastwise. The Union has the night to request the maximum  
penalty on any bulk commodity. The Joint Coast Labor Rela-  
tions Committee shall finally decide whether the commodity is  
to be on the no penalty fist, the bulk penalty list or the maxi-  
mum list.  
The bulk penalty rate of 25¢ is based on the basic offensive  
characteristics of the commodity to which the employees are  
subjected. The local parties or the local arbitrators shall be lim-  
ited in determining whether the normal bulk penalty or the  
maximum dust penalty is to be apptied on any particular oper-  
ation.  
Where the method of operation removes the offensiveness  
for which a penalty is paid, the Employers may process a re-  
quest through the grievance machinery to eliminate the penal-  
ty for that method of operation.

### CFS PROGRAM FUND  
The parties acknowledge their mutual interests in develop-  
ing productive work opportunities that preserve for dockwork-  
ers their work and living standards. Such a program will retain  
and attract to the industry responsible, reliable and skilled per-  
sons whose availability will assure a stable work force and will  
minimize the costs of those industry programs that are now re-  
quired when work is unavailable.  
The parties recognize that the continued movement of con-  
tainer work from the docks jeopardizes their aforesaid mutual  
_ interests. They desire to reverse that movement and encourage  
the establishment, developmert and growth of efficient and  
productive container freight stations on the docks to preserve  
the work which has historically been performed by the long-  
shore work force.  
To achieve these ends they have agreed as follows:  
(1) The employers will expend annually during the term  
of this contract approximately $3 million to be raised  
upon containerized cargo tonnage, (The reference to  
a dollar expenditure is nota cap upon the sum the em-  
ployers may be required to expend annually to  
achieve the objectives of this program.) The funds  
shall be managed by PMA and distnbuted by it to  
those of its members who operate CFS facilities,  
such distribution to be on a basis which will encour-  
age the preservation, growth and increase of such  
container stuffing and unstuffing facilities. PMA will  
report periodically to the Union on the receipts and  
disbursements of the Fund.  
(2) The provisions of the Container Freight Station Sup-  
plement shal] not be burdened by arbitration deci-  
sions or past practices prior to July 1, 1984 whether  
189  
### CFS PROGRAM FUND  
190  
oral or written. Any restrictions on the employer that  
are in conflict with the provisions of the Container  
Freight Station Supplement will be considered null  
and void.  
(3) The parties will henceforth commit themselves to in-  
creasing CFS productivity and the elimination of  
wasteful work practices.  
(4) The parties agree to set up a joint committee to report  
periodically to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Com-  
mittee on the progress of this program and to make  
recommendations as to further implementation.  
(5) Disputes which arise with respect to this program  
shall be first referred to the Joint Port Labor Rela-  
tions Committee for the port where the dispute may  
arise and, if necessary, may be referred by either par-  
ty to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee and  
then by either party to the Coast Arbitrator.  
(6) This prograrn may be terminated with the mutual  
written consent of the parties upon 60 days’ written  
notice to all employers receiving distributions under  
this program and, in all events, this program shall im-  
mediately terminate if the provisions of CFS Sec-  
tions 1.5 through 1.543 of the 1970-71 Container  
Freight Station Supplement and CFS Sections 1.53,  
1,54, 1.55 and 1.57 ofthe amended Container Freight  
Station Supplement that were entered into February  
10, 1972 are determined to be legally enforceable.  
### SUPPLEMENT | COASTWISE REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER  
  
### COASTWISE REGISTRATION AND  
### TRANSFER  
The Joint Port Labor Relations Committee in any port, sub-  
ject to the ultimate control of the Joint Coast Labor Relations  
Committee, shall exercise control over registration lists in that  
port, including the power to make additions to or subtractions  
from the registered lists as may be necessary. Any tongshore-  
man or clerk who is properly registered by a Joint Port Labor  
Relations Committee acting under their agreement and this  
Supplement I has coastwise registration under the Pacific  
Coast Longshore and Clerks’ Agreement. The nghts and oblig-  
ations of coastwise registration shail be under the control of the  
Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee and subject to the pro-  
visions set forth herein below.  
### 1. TRANSFERS OF LONGSHOREMEN  
### BETWEEN PORTS  
1.1 A longshoreman having fully registered status as a Class  
A longshoreman may transfer to another port, and as a fully  
Class A longshoreman at such other port, provided;  
1.11 The Joint Port Labor Relations Committee at the for-  
mer home port determines that a transfer ts warranted on the  
basis of work opportunity or that there are compelling reasons  
for letting him transfer despite the need for him at that port and  
that there is an opening available for him at the port to which he  
seeks to be transferred.  
4.12 Transfers shall not be permitted if contrary to policies  
established by the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee; and  
1.13 The Joint Port Labor Relations Committee to which  
transfer is made, by applying the usual rules finds there is an  
191  
### COASTWISE REGISTRATION AND TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT  
opening available for him on the list of such port and approves  
him for transfer of registration.  
1.2 Arequest for transfer may be denied by the Joint Port La-  
bor Refations Committee of the pont from which transfer is  
sought ifthe longshoreman is needed at that port orifhe has not  
had a satisfactory record at that port.  
1.3 No longshoreman shall be eligible for transfer who  
within a year of the application has been the subject of  
major discipline.  
1.4 Arequest for transfer may be denied by the Joint Port La-  
bor Relations Committee of the port to which the man seeks to  
transfer, Any denial of transfer, except because there is no  
opening available on its list, shall be subject to review in ac-  
cordance with the procedure and rules that are applicable.  
1.5 No fully registered man shall be entitled to transfer under  
these provisions until he has held such status for at least 1 year.  
1.6 Hereunder, a fully registered longshoreman may transfer  
only to fully registered status as a longshoreman in another  
port. The place of the transferred man on the Class A list of the  
port to which he transfers shall be determined by his total Class  
A and Class B registered time as compared to such time of  
those on the Class A list of the port to which he transfers.  
1.7 Fully registered men having less than | year of such sta-  
tus and limited registered men may apply for inclusion on  
the limited registered list of another port and consideration  
shall be given to the work and availability record under the  
Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement in taking action on  
such applications.  
An application of such a longshoreman for limited registra-  
tion in the second port shall be considered without discrimina-  
tion based upon his failure to be a resident of the port to which  
application is made provided the Joint Port Labor Relations  
192  
### COASTWISE REGISTRANON AND TRANSFER  
Committee of the pon where he has limited registration certi-  
fies to the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee of the port  
where application is made that the applicant has a fully satis-  
factory record as a longshoreman in the port where registered  
and that there is no reason to interfere with his transfer that is  
deemed sufficient by the Joint Port Labor Relations Commit-  
tee. In considering the application of a limited registered long-  
shoreman from another port, consideration may be given to his  
employment provided the favorable certification referred to  
above is submitted by the Joint Port Labor Relations Commit-  
tee where he has been registered.  
### 2. VISITING REGULATIONS FOR THE HOME  
### PORT  
2.1 Fully registered men shall be freely accorded visiting  
privileges subject to the manpower needs of their home port  
and the port to be visited as more specifically set forth below.  
2.2 Permission to leave a home port can be granted only by ac-  
tion of the appropriate Joint Port Labor Relations Committee  
acting under the Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement. One  
who leaves his home port without Joint Port Labor Relations  
Committee approval shall be subject to being called back when  
needed and lo deregistration if he then fails to make himself  
available at his home port,  
2.3 Permission to leave to visit need not be granted if there is

the Class A, Class B, and Identified Casual List. Such additions  
shall be accomplished prior to the next quarterly review. In the  
event the local parties reach disagreement on additions to the  
Class A, Class B, or Identified Casual List, such disagreement  
shall be referred to the JCLRC and shall be arbitrable. The ob-  
jective of this provision is to add workers in small numbers to  
each List on a more regular basis and to avoid large additions.

### SKILLED HOLDMEN —- HOLDMEN  
### CAPABLE OF DRIVING LIFTS  
CLRC No. 11, August 5, 1966 (Item 2(e)})  
The Employers stated they will not pay the skill differential  
to men until they are capable of driving lifts.  
The Union suggested the approach that where it is recog-  
nized at the local level that a gang does not have qualified ma-  
chine operators therein, then prior to the 2 men receiving the  
differential, holdmen capable of driving lifts will replace them  
in the gang.  
It is the dispatchers’ obligation to make up gangs properly,  
and this now includes providing 2 holdmen capable of driving  
lifts,  
- It was further agreed as follows:  
1. In gang boss ports, itis the gang bosses’ obligation (o see  
to it the basic gang is properly constituted, and the holdmen ca-

patchers’ responsibility to see that the basic gang is properly  
constituted on dispatch;  
2. Inalt other ports the dispatchers shall dispatch the prop-  
er holdmen;  
3. Should the employer find there are no holdmen capable  
of driving lifts he may—  
(a) Swing in skilled men from the dock who are not on  
the old or disabled preferential list and swing out the  
holdmen who were dispatched as the men capable of  
driving lifts, or a  
(b) Discharge the gang, or  
(c) Call for replacements, or  
(d) Suspend the skill differential, and  
(c) Process the complaint through the ma-  
chinery.  
4. The local LRC’s have the discretion of filling these  
skilled hold jobs with either Class A or Class B longshoremen,  
and such men are to be regularly attached to the gang.  
CLRC No. 21, November 3, 1967 (Item 2)  
The Committee again discussed the issues in this case and  
agreed that if there are no lift drivers available, meaning if no  
lift drivers are employed by the employer in the dock or termi-  
nal area, skilled holdmen may operate the lift on the dock for  
the purpose of bringing or removing gear or other necessary  
equipment to or from the hatch when no productive work is  
being performed.

### iN LIEU OF TIME  
CLRC No. 7, May 4, 1961 (Item 3)  
in Lieu of Time  
The parties have discussed and have reached agreement on  
a general rule covering the assignment of work set forth in Sec- .  
tion] .6 of the Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement. It was fur-  
ther agreed that the adoption of this general rule for assignment  
of work under Section 1.6 will not be interpreted to support  
claims for in lieu of pay for work performed by American ~  
crews under the status quo understanding.  
Subject to the foregoing understanding the parties agree:  
{1} Longshoremen shall be assigned to work covered by  
Section 1.6 commencing when the ship is tied up on arrival and  
ending when lines are fet go for the ship to leave the dock, ex-  
cept for the purpose of shifting within a port. (Shifts between  
ports shail not be included in longshore work assignment.)  
(2) Exceptions to (1} above are as follows:  
(a) The crew may be used for the complete rigging of the  
jumbo gear.  
(b) The crew may secure gear, lower booms, and swing  
in booms alongside the dock.  
(c) Handling ship’s stores. If loads are to be built on the  
doék and ship’s gear Is to be used, longshoremen  
shall build the loads and handle gear to land such  
loads on deck, During a shifl when no longshoremen  
are employed the crew may use ship’s gear to bring  
stores aboard.  
The agreement to assign the above described work to long-  
shoremen shall not result in the payment of in lieu of time to  
longshoremen if such work is performed by crew members un-  
der the status quo for American ships.

### IN JEU OF TIME ADDENDA  
The Committee agreed that the subject of cargo carpentry  
work done in connection with the cargo is still under discussion.  
CLAC No. 25, October 30, 1961 4) in Lieu  
of Time—Interpretation of Paragraph 2({c}  
(Reference is made to CLRC Meeting No. 7, May ¢,  
3.)  
The agreement reached on “In Lieu of Time” in the meeting  
of the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee noted above is  
not to be interpreted so as to Support claims for in bieu of pay for  
work normally and properly performed by American crews un-  
der the status quo understanding or to alter such understanding.  
Thus, the agreement to assign work as described to longshore-  
men does not result in payment of in lieu of time to longshore-  
men if such work 3s performed by crew members under the  
status quo for American ships.  
Reference is made to the following paragraph as contained  
in the above noted minutes:  
(¢) Handling Ship’s Stores. If loads are to be built on the  
dock and ship's gear is to be used, longshoremen shal] build the  
loads and handle gear to land such loads on deck. Duringa shift  
when no longshoremen are employed the crew may use ship’s  
gear to bring stores aboard.  
The Committee agrees that the crew under the above lan-  
guage would not be used during meal hours or between shifts.  
Ship's stores may be hand-carried aboard by the crew. If no  
longshore gangs are on the ship during a shift, the crew can use  
the gear (includes conveyor or sideport operation) and load  
ship’s stores, including the building of loads.  
It was further agreed that: .  
1, Ship’s stores that have been pre-palletized may be hoist-  
ed aboard ship (to be thereafter de-palletized and stowed by  
ship’s crew) by any longshore gang already employed on the

ship providing such a gang has in its complement winch drivers  
and hatch tender, front men or swingmen to hook on the loads,  
and sufficient holdmen or swingmen as part of the gang on  
board to unhook said loads, A gang may be supplemented to  
reach this complement.  
2. Ship’s stores delivered to ship’s side that are to be built  
into loads on the dock and then hoisted aboard ship to be there-  
after de-palletized and stowed by ship's crew can be so built  
and hoisted aboard with a basic gang that is already employed.  
Two of the 4 holdmen will assist the front men in building the  
loads on the dock, and the other 2 holdmen will unhook the  
loads on the deck.  
3. [flongshoremen are directed by an employer to stow the  
stores in the various appropriate lockers or compartments, the  
basic 4 holdmen gang must be supplemented by not fewer than  
4 swingmen; however, the contractual exception in paragraph  
23 of the October 18, 1960 Memorandum of Agreement shall  
apply, and the gang may or may not be further supplemented on  
the ship or dock, based on the needs of the operation at the em-  
ployer's option. ,  
4. Where standing gear is not being used to load stores,  
longshoremen when employed to load stores under these cir-  
cumstances shali be employed in such numbers, skilled and  
unskilled, as required for the particular operation.  
The parties agreed that in connection with the above under-  
standing, the matter shall be reviewed by the Joint Coast Labor  
Relations Committee in 90 days or during a subsequent wage  
review,

### iN LIE OF TIME ADDENDA  
The Employer members of the Committee raised the ques-  
tion of a timely notice being served on the employer when the  
Union feels that an “in lieu of” violation has occurred.  
The Committee, after discussion, agreed that when the  
Union alleges that the crew is or has been performing !ong-  
shore work on which an “in liew of” claim will be filed, such no-  
tification must be given to the stevedoring company involved  
and/or the Association within 24 hours. On Sundays and holi-  
days the notice must be given on the following business day,  
If such notification is not given in such timely fashion the  
claims are to be denied.

### | JOBS OF SHORT DURATION  
CLRC No. 25, October 30, 1961 {Item 1)  
Amended in CLRC No. 12, June 23, 1962 1)  
The Coast Committee is aware that 11 has ruled on many dis-  
putes on this subject, but desired to define a job of short dura-  
tion so that it would be clearly understood, The Committee  
agreed upon the following definition:  
An operation of short duration is one which is comprised of  
the following elements and only when the order is placed fora  
man of short duration:  
1. [tmust be 6 hours or less with no meal,  
2. It pertains tothe man and not the gang.  
3. It pertains to a man ina skilled classification (i.e., winch  
drivers, lift truck operators, bull drivers, etc.).  
4. I pertains toa specific shift.  
5. Itcequires a 4-hour minimum guarantee.  
6. Itallows a skilled man to be shifted to comparable work  
on the original ship or dock.  
7. Askilled man may be shifted to comparable work on an-  
other ship or dock but if this is done, such a man receives an 8-  
hour guarantee rather than the 4-hour guarantee,  
8. Askilled man of short duration shall be ordered at regu-  
lar dispatch to start the job at any time, This does not preclude  
orders for jobs of short duration during the course of the shift  
where the need could not be foreseen at regular ordering time.  
9. Askilled man of short duration must be one supplement-  
ing askilled man of the same skill already on the job on the shift  
in which the requirement for the extra skill’man occurs. Each  
shift stands own insofar as employment of short duration  
is concerned.  
221  
### NO DISCRIMINATION ; ADDENDA  
Example 1. A job of short duration beginning after the  
midshift meal but not completed by the end of that shift may  
be continued on the next immediate shift as day follows night  
or night follows day, with another man employed for a job of  
Short duration.  
Example 2. Ajob ofshort duration during a given shiftand  
completed before the end of such shift and with cargo opera-  
tions not requiring the man of short duration occurring afterhis —  
release, may be repeated on the next comparable shift and both  
such jobs shall be considered as jobs of short duration.  
Example 3. Ajobof short duration during a given shiftand  
completed at the end of such shift and with cargo operations not  
requiring a man of short duration a1 the beginning of the next  
comparable shift will permit the employment ofa man of short  
duration on that next comparable shift.  
Example 4. It is not permissible under the Agreement to  
consider as jobs of short duration work which takes a man of  
short duration to the end of one shift and the start of the next  
comparable shift. Employment on such a basis wil! require  
payment of 8-hour guarantees on both such shifts.

crimination or harassment, committed by anyone, will not be  
tolerated in connection with any action subject to the terms  
of the Pacific Coast Longshore & Cierk’s Agreement (the  
PCLCA or Agreement) (including at work sites, joint dis-  
patch halls, training sites, and other locations, when reason-  
ably related to employment covered by this Agreement).  
The policy against discrimination and harassment stated in  
Section 13 of the Pacific Coast Longshore & Clerk's Agreement  
shall be administered as described in this document.  
2. Responsibility for Following Section 13.2  
All longshore workers, clerks, walking bosses/foremen,  
superintendents or managers, outside truck drivers, vendors,  
contractors and others are required to follow this Policy and

PMA or the ILWU know of particular incidents of discrimina-  
tion or harassment, Discrimination and harassment can be elim-  
inated from the workplace only if everyone working under the  
PCLCA who experiences or sees such problems files a griev-  
ance using the Special Section 13.2 Grievance Procedures for  
discrimination and harassment. It is also important if you

Policy for anyone to treat another in a way that is threaten-  
ing, intimidating, embarrassing or offensive, or that denies a  
person equal treatment and opportunities because of his or  
her sex, race or other unique characteristics. So-called “good  
intentions” oc “joking around” (as determined by the  
Arbitrator) does not excuse Prohibited Conduct.  
To assist you in recognizing and avoiding behavior which  
may be considered harassing, discriminatory, or retaliatory,

Physical Harassment: Unwelcome touching or grab-  
bing or sexual assault, blocking someone’s movement,  
standing unnecessarily close.

sive language related to a person's gender, race or other  
defining characteristics.  
Visual Harassment: Displaying objects, messages, pic-  
tures, pornography, graffiti, or drawings of a sexual or racial  
nature; engaging in offensive and unwelcome personal con-  
duct such as offensive gestures, staring {especially at partic-  
ular body parts}, mooning, leering; showing a lack of respect  
for privacy in toilet facilities and locker rooms.  
Unwelcome Romantic or Sexual Attention: Unwelcome  
flirting, pressuring another for a date and unwelcome sexual  
advances; also demanding sexual favors or romantic attention  
as a condition of any type of employment benefit.

### PICKET LINE LANGUAGE  
CLRC No. 1, January 29, 1954  
Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines: There was a gener-  
al discussion of language pertaining to this subject, wherein  
the Union stated that they did not expect longshoremen to get  
paid for observing picket lines, but on the other hand, did not  
want longshoremen necessarily ordered day afler day.  
It was agreed that the following language which was ini-  
tialed by the parties, will be the guide to settle any claims in the  
future and, likewise, wipe out the meaning of past arbitration  
awards on the subject.

Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines:  
A local shall, through its president or its secretary, notify  
PMA in writing of intention to respect a specific picket line.  
Delivery of such written notice shall relieve the dispatching  
hall of obligation to furnish men or gangs to the picketed oper-  
ation unti! a decision under the grievance machinery is issued  
ordering the start or continuance of work,  
Menor gangs ordered prior to or within 2 hours of such writ-  
ten notice to PMA shall report to work without benefit of cov-  
erage of minimum report time as provided in the Agreement.  
Men or gangs ordered later than 2 hours following such re-  
ceipt but prior to the issuance of a by the parties  
through grievance machinery shall, ifthey accept the order and  
-ceport, be covered by the minimum provisions of the Agree-  
ment, provided, however, that failure of the employer to place  
orders following such receipt shall not constitute any waiver of  
the employer's position nor an acceptance of the umion’s posi-  
tion, pending decision as hereinafter provided.  
Following the establishment of any picket line about the  
premises of an employer affecting the work of employees cov-  
ered by ILWU-PMA Agreements, either party may require a  
meeting of the Joint Labor Relations Committee of the port af-  
fected (or an Area Committee or the Coast Committee, if  
such is agreed to be appropriate) and such meetings shall be  
held immediately.  
The Committee shall promptly examine the facts and issue  
its written decision as to whether the picket line is Jegitimate  
and bona fide under the Agreement. Should a Committee fail  
to reach such a decision, then either party may refer the matter  
to the Area Arbitrator for prompt interim decision.

Letter of Understanding dated July 1, 1984  
With regard to the revision of Sections 12.31 and 12.311 in  
the 1984 negotiations:  
“The Union pointed out the above understanding could pre-  
sent a problem in ports where three 8 hour shift operations oc-  
cur under the local agreements. In such situations the start of  
an 8 hour shift could overlap the time peciod of a scheduled  
meeting.  
“The parties agreed that if the three 8-hour shifts present  
a problem, it would have to be accommodated so that ail  
members of a local are given the opportunity to attend their

### STEADY SKILLED MEN  
CLRC No. 14, October 11, 1966 (Item 1)  
The Employers inquired as to what the Union had in mind  
in implementing the “Steady Skilled Man” provision of the  
new Agreement.  
There was considerable discussion following which the  
Employers stated they would discuss this matter further and be  
prepared to talk about it again in the afternoon session.  
The Employers stated they reviewed the matters discussed  
al the morning session and feel the following proposal will  
meet the needs of both parties:  
1. Aguarantee to skilled men regardless of category at a  
minimum of 173 hours per month at the differential shall  
be paid to steady employees. Such guarantee shall be paid irre-  
spective of how long an individual is retained during any  
month as a steady skilled man; provided, however, that should  
such steady skilled man be released for cause during any  
month, the guarantee shall be prorated over the period such  
employee was retained as a steady man;  
2. Should a steady man be upgraded, he will receive the  
applicable higher skilt differential for the balance of the shift  
regardless of the period of time of utilization on the equipment  
carrying the higher differential;  
248  
### SAN FRANGISCO STEADY SKILLED MEN ADDENDA  
3. All hours worked (including dead time hours under  
the 8-hour guarantee) by such steady man will count against  
his guarantee;  
4. Travel time will not be a part of the guarantee;  
5. The guarantee isnota limitation of the employers’ nght  
to work such steady men over and above such guarantee; 1.¢.,  
the guarantee represents a minimum payment for the privilege  
of obtaining steady skilled men,  
6. It is not intended to allow an employer to hire steady  
skilled men so that he may then order longshoremen to make -  
up a basic gang, thus avoiding using 4 basic gang from the hall,  
7. Where a skilled man is required for a job of short dura-  
tion the employer may use his steady skilled men.  
The Union members of the Committee agree in principle  
with the above proposal and as a result thereof, it was agreed  
that with the above as the basis for the employment of steady  
skilled men, the employers may begin discussing such em-  
ployment with the men and employing steady men. It was fur-  
ther agreed the Crane provisions of Section 14 on steady men  
are retained.

C, The employer shall provide to the union a notice  
employment position ‘for posting in the joint longshore dis-

selection and employment of the steady employee.  
Amended July 15, 1999, Memorandum of Understanding  
as follows:  
For San Francisco steady skilled men, the provisions of  
CLRC Meeting No. 14-66, item !, Paragraph (1.} are modified  
as follows:  
The day and night monthly (four week) pay guarantee shall  
be 180 hours (45 hours per week) at the proper (first or second)

In exchange for receiving the monthly (four week) guaran-  
tee, steady skilled men may not work more than two shifts out  
of the hall in any payroll week.

intent of the parties is that jobs suitable for Dock Preference  
work will be identified as such when ordered by the Employ-  
ers, and that longshoremen on the Dock Preference Board will  
be given first preference for this work. Second preference for  
these jobs will be given to longshoremen in the Gang Dock  
Preference category and to longshoremen meeting the provi-  
sions of Section 3.133 and its subsections. Consistent with this  
expressed intent, the parties agree to the following:  
A. The Employers will properly order all jobs by name (Pin  
Man, Bus Driver, etc.) and type (e.g., ship or dock).  
B. The parties note the following jobs are presently assigned  
and will continue to be assigned to"Deock Preference”:

(b) Application of the maximum work hours limitation to  
individual steady crane operators shall not include the first ex-  
tended shift hours for shifting/sailing a vessel in each payroll  
week.  
{c) Steady crane operators shall have all crane hours  
worked for their steady employer on a dispatch from the dis-  
patching hall count against the monthly maximum hours limi-

Any applicant in accordance with the above sequence who  
is deemed by the employer to be unsatisfactory and who files a  
grievance must be given a review by the JPLRC and the griev-  
ance resolved prior to steady employment being offered. The  
applicant must file a grievance within 48 hours of the employ-  
er’s notice to the Union of its selection or inability to fill a  
steady crane operator position. The JPLRC must meet within  
43 hours of receipt of the grievance to review the complaint,  
and any disagreement must be promptly referred to the Arca  
Arbitrator who shall render a decision within 10 days. Any

### CRANE OPERATORS  
The crane hours of the certified Class A crane driver  
checked in on the primary board the first 2 weeks of the 13-  
week period will be divided into the total crane hours that are  
dispatched through the dispatch hall. This review will be used  
to see what impact this new formula is having on equalization  
of hours.

A. Utilization  
Provide that steadily employed Utility Truck Drivers (UTR’s)  
can be utilized on all dock operations as required by the  
Emptoyer,  
B. Semitractor Dispatch Board  
A‘‘Semitractor Dispatch Board” or Boards shall be established  
by the JPLRC upon the basis of the following proposal.  
Semitractor Dispatch Board  
Based upon the common acknowledgment that trained  
skilled operators are essential to overall efficient longshore op-  
erations, the parties agree to the establishment of a Class A  
Semitractor Dispatch Board.  
The creation of the Class A Semitractor Dispatch Board is to  
assure the dispatch of longshoremen whe have been trained to  
efficiently operate the semitractors which are essential to con-  
tainer operations in the port.  
The Semitractor Dispatch Board shall be created with dis-  
patch priority to be given to those on the Boards as follows:  
1, First priority shali be given to Class A longshoremen  
with over 5 years’ experience, who volunteer to be on the  
Board.  
263 ©  
### LOS ANGELES/LONG BEACH UTR ORIVEAS ADDENDA  
2. Second priority shall be given ta Class A longshoremen  
with less than 5 years’ experience, who have completed the  
ILWU-PMA Semitractor Training Program,  
3. The next-in-line dispatch sequence for jobs not filled by  
the Class A Semitractor Board shall be under the principle of  
low-man-first to be dispatched on the Jitney Board and then the  
Low Board dispatch sequence.  
4. The fourth priority shal! be given to Class B longshore-  
men who have completed the ILWU-PMA Semitractor Train-  
ing Program.  
With respect to those Class A longshoremen in 2 above, it is  
understood that time on the Semitractor Dispatch Board shall  
count toward meeting the “5S years in the hold” requirement  
(subject to the necessary waiver being granted by the Joint  
Coast Labor Relations Committee).  
The Joint LLRC shall, in accordance with Section 9.4, pro-  
vide for the appropriate number of Class A longshoremen (in 2  
above) on the Semitractor Dispatch Board from longshoremen  
elevated to Class A status after July 1, 1987. Any disagreement  
shall be submitted to the Area Arbitrator for resolution.  
Jobs dispatched from the Semitractor Dispatch Boards and  
semitractor jobs from the Class B Board must be accepted ora  
flop shall be given.  
The next-in-line dispatch sequence for jobs not filled by the  
above dispatch sequence shall then go to the next recognized  
procedure in the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach. Semitractor  
jobs shall be dispatched at feast one-half hour prior to the nor-  
mal shift starting time.  
C. Monthly Employment  
1, UTR’s shall, at the Employers’ option, be employed on a  
monthly basis. These operators can be used against all vessels’  
operations as required by the Employer.  
264  
### ADDENDA LOS ANGELES/LONG BEACH UTA DAIVERS  
2. Monthly employees shall be guaranteed monthly a mini-  
mum/maximum of 195 hours of work or pay at the applicable  
shift UTR rate of pay.  
3. These UTR operators shall report to the job one-half  
hour prior to the start of the shift for work other than actual han-  
dling or moving of cargo. The phrase “other than actual han-  
dling or moving of cargo” is intended to permit the preparation  
of equipment including chassis for movement to or from the  
vessel so Jong as there is no actual movement of cargo directly  
to or from the vessel.  
4. Employers who elect to employ UTR operators on a  
monthly basis for both day and/or night operations may order  
up to 50% of the average daily number of UTR operators used  
against their operations during the previous payroll quarter as  
recorded by the Joint Dispatch Hall and PMA Allocations.  
New Employers or new container terminals may employ  
monthly UTR operators after a payroll quarter of operation,  
based on the foregoing formula.  
5. All ship operations with monthly UTR operators shall  
start on time shoutd the Dispatch Hail on any given day or days  
be unable to fill the remainder of UTR operators from the Hall  
at the start of any shift.  
6. Monthly UTR operators shall work against vessels as di-  
rected, on all UTR rated equipment, providing full flexibility  
as required by the Employer. Such flexibility shall include all  
work before vessel’s arrival and after vessel's departure on that  
shift. (This means cargo preparation for that vessel or dock  
storage of discharged cargo from that vessel.)  
7. Full flexibility includes the use of monthly UTR opera-  
tors for utilization between the vessel/CY and container move-  
ments to or from Container Rail Transfer Yards. Other UTR  
dock work remains as per past practice (i.c., container move-  
265  
### LOS ANGELES/LONG BEACH UTR DRIVERS ADDENDA  
ment from vessel toCY, vessel to Rai! Container Transfer Yard,  
CY to Rai] Container Transfer Yard and vice versa).  
8. First preference for monthly UTR work shall be given to  
those individuals checked in on the Dispatch Hajl C/L/UTR  
Board; second preference - Secondary UTR Board; third - low  
boards; fourth - B Board. Dispatch shall be based on “low man  
out” (lowest sign-in hours dispatched first). Individuals will  
have a timely check-in procedure for the 30-day dispatch.  
9. Monthly UTR’s will be responsible for arranging their  
own relief in accordance with Section 2.3 and subsections of  
the PCLCD. This allows the Dispatch Hall to dispatch relief  
UTR jobs on the Jow-man-out principle.  
10. Four days prior to the end of each month, Employers  
will notify the Dispatch Hall of their requirement of monthly  
UTR operators for the subsequent month. The number of such  
jobs shall be posted by the joint Dispatchers in the Dispatch  
Hall 3 days prior to the end of the month. On the first day of  
each month, the dispatch of monthly UTR operators shall oc-  
cur at & time so as to guarantee arrival of all monthly UTR op-  
erators to their Employer one-half hour prior to the start of the  
shift.  
11. This procedure for the employment and use of monthly  
UTR operators shal! be effective September 1, 1990.  
12. The JPLRC shall, after September 1, 1991, review the  
foregoing conditions and consider expanding the utilization of  
monthly UTR operators by mutual agreement. Any such  
JPLRC agreement shall be subject to CLRC approval.  
13. Practices as of July 1, 1990 with respect to the employ-  
ment and the utilization of operators from the UTR category  
shall remain unchanged.  
14. For efficiency of dispatch, monthly employees may be  
dispatched individually or as units. The dispatching method  
266 -

as provided for in this document.

### DISPATCH HALL COSTS  
Effective January |, 1997, the PMA agrees to be obligated  
to pay 65% of all 1996 base year Dispatch Hall] expenses and  
the Union agrees that each local will be obligated to pay 35%  
of all 1996 base year Dispatch Hall! expenses. For the purpose  
of these obligations, the 1996 base year expenses of the Dis-  
patch Halls shalt be the January |, 1996, to December 31, 1996,  
equally shared expenses which appear on the audited financial  
statements. Whenever, due to reduction in dispatch hall costs  
or increase in the PCL&CA holiday cost, the average cost of a  
holiday exceeds 15% of the 1996 base year expenses, the  
Union's 35% share shall be reduced by a proportionate amount  
allocated to the focal dispatch halls administratively by the  
JCLRC. All additional jointly agreed to expenses above the  
base year shall be shared equally between PMA and  
the Local Union. The formula for sharing extraordinary capi-  
tal improvements shall be subject to mutual agreement of the  
parties.  
(Norwithstanding the fact that PMA’s contribution towards  
Dispatch Hall costs is by virtue of this Agreement greater than  
the contribution of the ILWU, nothing herein contained or oth-  
erwise shall in any way change or modify the basic principle  
and understanding of the parties as expressed in this Agree-  
ment that the Dispatch Halfs shall continue in the future, as  
they have in the past, to be maintained and operated jointly and  
equally by the LWU and the PMA.)  
Amended by July 15, 1999, Memorandum of Understand-  
ing to incorporate the following:

B. Upon completion of Item A, Dispatch Hall Costs Adden-  
da, PCLCD and PCCCD, shall be amended to provide that  
PMA shall be obligated to pay 85% instead of 65%, and the  
Union shall be obligated topay 15% instead of 35% of the 1998  
base year dispatch hall expenses, and the minimum Dispatch

and marine clerk and POWB&FA walking boss occupation  
codes in the previous contract year up to a maximum of 2000  
hours to those who have established a pension qualifying year.  
The contribution wil! be made to each account as soon as  
practicable following the end of each Contract year.
