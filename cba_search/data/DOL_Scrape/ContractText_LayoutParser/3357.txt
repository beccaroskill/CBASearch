satisfactorily placed in a position for which they are qualified.

marks in the second category, indicating areas that need attention,are ranked in the same  
manner. Teachers marked only in categories reflecting performance at or above Parkway  
expectations will be ranked by seniority. Teachers with the same starting dates will be  
ranked by random draw to establish single ranking positions. The starting date shall be  
determined by the first day of contracted teacher employment.

on the substitute list, according to seniority.  
b. Any tenured teacher who would have qualified for retirement during the reduction year

expense. as long as they are not eligible for membership in another plan, for a period  
of no longer than thirty-six (36) months from the date of the reduction.  
e. The fact that tenured teachers are affected by staff reduction shall not result in the loss  
of status or credit for previous years of service. Upon return to the District, they shall  
assume the step position on the salary schedule which they would have held in the  
year following the reduction.  
f. New teachers will not be employed by the District while there are tenured teachers of

### ARTICLE XXII  
### ACADEMIC FREEDOM  
The Board of Education believes that the existence and progress of a democratic society and the  
fulfillment of the Parkway School District mission demand freedom of teaching and freedom of  
learning. The nature of American democracy requires that citizens be provided freedom to listen  
to various sides of an issue, sort out the facts, and arrive at independent conclusions.  
The Board of Education expects staff members to include in the curriculum topics and teaching  
strategies, relative to the maturity and needs of students in accordance with district policy, that will  
produce an informed person who is able to deal intelligently and rationally with problems and  
issues with which he/she is or will be confronted as a member of society. The Board of Education  
expects staff members, in examining various sides of an issue, to promote objectivity and critical  
analysis.  
Because learning is essential to the preservation of a free society, the Board also affirms the  
students’ freedom to learn by searching for knowledge and truth. Freedom to learn includes the  
right of the learner to study, discuss, debate, or hold divergent and/or dissenting views.  
### WN  
The Board accepts the responsibility for the protection of academic freedom and will give  
support, within the law, to staff members and students who exercise this freedom responsibly in  
the schools. No adverse actions will be taken against teachers who refuse to suppress students’  
clearly established constitutional rights of free expression.  
### ARTICLE XXIV  
### PARENT OR STUDENT COMPLAINTS DIRECTED TOWARD EMPLOYEES  
The Board of Education recognizes that situations may arise in which parents, citizens. taxpayers,  
students and residents have concerns or complaints about school personnel. Such concerns are  
best handled through direct communication with the staff member in question and/or the  
supervisor of the staff member. Staff members are to be notified of formal complaints filed  
against them by any party mentioned in this policy. The District and Parkway NEA believe the  
parents and students have the right to voice their dissatisfaction regarding any matter of concern.  
Staff members have the responsibility to attempt to resolve these concerns in an appropriate and  
effective manner. Teachers and administrators will cooperate to resolve student and/or parents  
complaints by focusing on finding a solution to the problem and by utilizing appropriate problem,  
solving techniques.  
Concerns or complaints must first informally be directed to the employee involved. If the  
complainant is unable to resolve the issue with the employee directly. the complaint will be  
brought to the attention of the school principal or employee’s supervisor. The principal and/or  
employee's supervisor will arrange for a conference involving the employee and the complainant,  
within five (5) working days. No action of any sort shall be taken by the principal and/or  
employee's supervisor on the complaint prior to such a conference unless such action is required  
to protect the health and safety of the parties involved. The principal and/or supervisor may serve  
as a facilitator of any meeting between the parties involved. If the complainant is unable to  
resolve the problem with the employee directly and the supervisor has not been involved, the  
complainant should informally address the supervisor about the concern. The supervisor, after  
consulting the employee(s) involved, shall attempt to respond and, if possible, resolve the concern  
or problem.  
If the complainant is unable to informally resolve the concern or problem, the following process is  
to be utilized.  
The complainant is to request, complete, and submit District Complaint Form #115. On  
the form, each complainant will be required to identify the employee(s): specifically state  
his/her concern regarding the employee(s); indicate with whom the complainant discussed  
the matter in order to resolve the concern or the problem; indicate time and dates when  
such discussion occurred; briefly state the results of any discussion; indicate remedies  
about how the employee or the District could resolve the problem or complaint; and if the  
complaint could be resolved, how the change would benefit the District, staff. schools,  
and other related audiences.

To assure prompt resolution, the complainant must file a complaint as soon as all other attempts al  
resolution have been complete or perceived to be concluded. The complainant must file the  
complaint with the Superintendent's Office. The following procedure shall be used in processing  
the complaint:  
1. The employee(s) and the employee's supervisor shall be advised immediately and receive a  
copy of any formal complaint filed with the Superintendent by parents, students,  
taxpayers, citizens, and residents.  
De The Superintendent or his/her designee shall hold a conference with the complainant, the  
employee(s), the supervisor, and, if requested, the employee’s representative.  
prior to taking any action on the matter.

resolution, will be placed in the employee’s permanent file. The employee may add a  
response to the complaint form by contacting the Human Resource Office, and may attach  
other documents as the employee(s) may deem appropnate.  
4. Unsubstantiated, frivolous, malicious and/or vexatious charges shall not be placed in the  
employee’s permanent file. Any dispute regarding the placement or recording of  
complaints in the personnel file shall be processed through the grievance  
procedure. All such grievances shall be filed commencing at Level Three.  
The Superintendent and /or his representative will outline a brief plan of action for the complainant  
upon receipt of the formal Complaint Form #115. Concerns and complaints against personnel  
require varying degrees of investigation, and therefore, the Superintendent and/or his  
representative shall indicate a tentative timeline for responding to and/or resolving the concern or  
problem.  
The Superintendent should inform complainants that they may not address the Board at public  
meetings concerning personnel complaints. Complainants may register a written complaint with  
the Board of Education.  
### ARTICLE XXV  
### PUPIL DISCIPLINE  
The Board and administration will continue to utilize discussions, with the advice, suggestions

designated or approved jointly by the district and the employee, whose certification shall be  
final and binding.

short absences that contribute to inefficient school operations. Upon finding that the

### ARTICLE XXXIII  
### SALARY SCHEDULE OPERATIONAL PLAN  
Teachers are appointed by the Board of Education on the recommendation of the  
Superintendent of Schools.  
This schedule applies to all full-time and part-time teachers employed under contract by the  
Parkway School District. Full-time teachers are those teaching a full day. Part time  
teachers are those teaching !ess than a full day.  
Teachers accepting employment agree to accept the assignment of the Superintendent of  
Schools. Assignments may be changed during the school year in accordance with Board  
Policy GCI as required to serve the best interests of the school system.  
An employment period of up to 191 days (unless in compliance with state law, additional  
days are required to make up lost days due to inclement weather conditions per School  
Calendar Article) is covered by this schedule, including legal school holidays and approved  
professional meetings.  
Salary increments for assignments beyond normal curricular and co-curricular duties will  
be given as approved each year by the Board of Education. Teachers shall receive  
additional compensation if their contracted period of employment extends over a period  
longer than the regular period of employment as defined in Paragraph 4. Counselors,  
C.QO.E. Coordinators, and Librarians working in excess of their regular contracted days  
shall be paid on an extended duty contract at an hourly rate determined by 1/1528 of their  
previous year’s contract amount.  
Deductions for absences from teaching duties or approved professional meetings will be  
determined by dividing the teacher’s annual salary by the number of days covered by the  
teacher's contract and multiplying the quotient by the number of days absent. Exceptions  
are absences covered by the sick, bereavement, personal, and jury/witness and other paid  
leave policies or as approved on an individual basis by the Board of Education.  
If a teacher is released from his/her contract by the Board of Education prior to  
completing the terms of the contract, his/her total salary for that school year will be  
determined on the basis of the ratio of the number of days of service rendered in that  
school year to the total number of days covered by his/her contract.  
Full and part-time teachers, under contract serving on appointments for less than a full year  
shall receive a salary based on the appropriate step and channel determined for teachers  
employed for a full year, except their salary shall be prorated for the time of actual services  
provided, except as affect by Paragraph 16.  
Salaries determined by this schedule will be paid in twenty-six (26) installments and made  
on every other Friday. When a payday falls on a holiday or a day which is not scheduled  
as a regular workday, the salary installment will be paid on the last preceding workday.

Salaries will be paid according to the above schedule except that the balance of salary  
otherwise due on pay dates falling after the last scheduled working day will be distributed  
in a final payment on the last scheduled working day of the regular school year following  
the check out procedure with the building principal.  
All salaries paid for non-contractual assignments (workshops, camp) shall be paid within  
the next two regular biweekly pay periods following the completion of the assignment.  
Teachers who qualify for a channel placement change shall have their individual contract  
adjusted to reflect the additional compensation as provided by the appropriate channel of  
the salary schedule. The effective date of such salary adjustments shall be the third pay  
period following receipt by the Department of Human Resources of all documentation in  
support of the additional earned graduate credit. Prior approval for credit on the salary  
schedule must be given by the Superintendent of Schools for graduate credit not  
acceptable toward an advanced degree in the subject matter area to which the teacher is  
assigned. Teachers who dually enroll in their senior year and receive some graduate credit  
prior to receiving their baccalaureate degrees, and teachers who complete work in excess  
of the requirements for their Master’s Degrees, shall have these graduate hours counted  
toward requirements for the next channel if the courses can be counted toward an  
advanced degree in the subject matter areas to which they are assigned. The requirements  
for placement on Channel Ill of the salary schedule will be met only when the Master's  
Degree has been conferred. Beginning September 1, 2000, the requirement for placement  
on Channel IV of the salary schedule shall be met when a teacher holding a Master's  
Degree will have acquired a minimum of 15 graduate hours after receiving his/her  
Master’s Degree. The requirements for placement on Channel V of the salary schedule  
shall be met when a teacher holding a Master’s Degree will have acquired a minimum cf  
30 hours after receiving his/her Master's Degree. Such additional hours for placement on  
Channels IV and V must be directly related to the teaching assignment, professional  
contribution and /or effectiveness in the district.  
Approved “Parkway Salary Credit Workshop” courses offered by the Parkway School  
District will be accepted as partial fulfillment of requirements for placement on Channels  
I], IV. and V of the salary schedule so long as such courses are directly related to the  
teaching assignment, professional contribution and/or effectiveness in the district.  
Exceptions may be approved by the Department of Human Resources. However, no  
more than six hours of credit for a channel change may be satisfied through the  
satisfactory completion of approved “Parkway Salary Credit Workshops.” Further, for  
placement on Channels IV and V, such salary credits must have been completed after  
receipt of a Master’s Degree.  
Placement on the salary schedule will be recognized by previous comparable experience  
and will be computed as follows:  
A. 1) A maximum of fourteen years teacher experience will be granted for  
placement on the salary schedule.  
2) In determining placement, experience will be approved by the following  
policy:  
a) One step for each full year of full time teaching in the ten years  
prior to Parkway.  
38  
O 0 ~] Aun BR Wb  
2.  
b) One-half step for each full year of full time teaching in the eight  
years prior to the time referred to in (a) above.  
Cc) No credit will be granted for the experience earned more than  
eighteen years prior to being hired at Parkway.  
d) Placement is in full year increments. (i.e. seven and one-half years  
of credit qualifies for step 8)  
Teaching experience of less than full time, but at least half time wil] be considered  
for salary schedule credit on the basis of one-half year credit for each full year of  
part time teaching, subject to the limitations of Section A.  
Credit for service as a full time Teacher’s Assistant or Permanent Substitute in the  
Parkway District will be considered for salary schedule credit on the basis of one-  
half year credit for each full year up to a maximum of four years credit, subject to  
the year limitations of subsection (a) above.  
No credit will be allowed for any of the f ollowing:  
Practice teaching, substitute teaching, part time of less than half time. night or  
adult school, or non-school religious programs.  
A maximum of five years placement on the salary schedule may be considered in  
unusual circumstances when the Superintendent feels that the non-educational  
background of an otherwise properly certified applicant makes the applicant more  
qualified than an applicant with an education degree but no teaching or significant  
non-education experience.  
Any experience considered under this section must have been in an area germane  
to the teaching certification/assignment and must have occurred immediately  
preceding the applicant’s employment in Parkway, except for any time needed to  
obtain certification, and the number of years of placement on the salary schedule  
must be recommended by the Superintendent to the Board of Education for its  
specific approval.  
Teaching experience with one or two employers during the course of one school  
year with no more than one school year quarter break in service will be considered  
as a full year of teaching experience.  
Changes in this paragraph grantin g credit for previous experience became effective  
for the 1988/89 school year and are not retroactive for employee hired full time or  
part time prior to the 1988/89 school year.  
Teachers employed under this salary schedule must complete four units of in-service credit  
within a four year period ending on September 1 of the fourth year following initial  
employment and each four years thereafter. Teachers who fail to meet this requirement  
will not receive the annual salary increment provided by this schedule. Teachers who are

performance is rated satisfactory, shall receive advancement on the salary schedule if  
reemployed in the succeeding school year.

absence, mid-year terminations, unexpected enrollment increases or in positions expected  
to be eliminated the following year, will be advised by letter accompanying their contract  
that they will not be renewed for the following school year.

### SCHOOL INITIATED INSTRUCTIONAL CHANGE PROCESS  
The District and the Association agree to collaborate in promoting meaningful change and  
improvement in the quality of instruction in order to create the best school environment for  
students.  
Every effort will be made to develop and implement school initiated instructional changes within  
the parameters and provisions of the Agreement between the Board of Education and the  
Parkway NEA. As these prospective changes are proposed which the Association may feel do  
not comply with the Board of Education/Parkway NEA Agreement, or the implementation of  
which is reasonable believed to be impossible to realize in the context of the Agreement, the  
Parkway NEA President and the Area Superintendent responsible for the supervision of the  
school will meet and discuss the proposed school changes with the school staff and  
administration. If the concern cannot be resolved at this stage, then it may be brought to the  
Employee Relations Council. |  
Within a period of time appropriate to the nature of the implemented change, an evaluation will be  
performed including at a minimum the school administration and the teaching staff. The results  
of this evaluation will be presented to the Area Superintendent and the Parkway NEA President  
and will be communicated to the Board of Education. The communication tot the Board of  
Education may include a position statement by the Parkway NEA and the District administration.

rights under the Board/Parkway NEA Agreement to pursue the Grievance Procedure nor as a  
waiver of rights of either the Parkway NEA nor the Board of Education the terms and conditions  
of the agreement.
