Section 1. The Employer hereby recognizes and acknowledges that the  
Union is the exclusive representative of all employees in the classifications of  
work covered by this Agreement for the purpose of collective bargaining as  
provided by the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended. The  
Employer will bargain in good faith with respect to renewal or extension of the  
current or any subsequent collective bargaining agreement.  
Inasmuch as the Employer is satisfied that the Union represents a majority  
of its employees in the bargaining unit described herein, the Employer recognizes  
the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent under Section 9{a) of the National  
Labor Relations Act for all employees within the bargaining unit on all present  
and future job sites within the jurisdiction of the Union, unless and until such time  
as the Union loses its status as the employees’ exclusive representative as the  
result of an NLRB election requested by the employees. The Employer agrees that  
it will not request an NLRB election and expressly waives any right it may have to  
do so. If the Union has not yet submitted a determination of its majority support,  
the Employer agrees that, upon the Union’s presentation of evidence of majority  
status among its employees in the bargaining unit described herein, it will  
voluntarily recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for all  
employees within the bargaining unit on all present and future job sites within the  
jurisdiction of the Union. The Employer expressly waives any right it has to  
condition its recognition of the Union upon the Union’s certification by the NLRB  
as the employees’ bargaining representative following the NLRB election.  
Section 2. All present employees who are members of the Union on the  
effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing by the  
payment of their regular monthly dues as a condition of continued employment.  
All present employees who are not members of the Union and all employees who  
are hired hereafter for work in the classification specified herein shall become and  
remain members in good standing by the payment of the required initiation fee and  
regular monthly dues on the eighth (8th) day following the execution of this  
Agreement or the date of employment, whichever is later, and shall thereafter  
maintain such good dues standing for the term of this Agreement.  
Section 3. Upon receipt of written notice from the Union, the Employer  
shall discharge any employee who fails to become or is not a member of the Union  
on the prescribed day, provided membership was available under the same terms  
and conditions as generally applicable to other members. The Union agrees to  
indemnify, defend and hold the Employer harmless from any claim arising from  
any such discharge.  
Section 4. “Membership in good standing” as referred to herein means the  
tender or payment of initiation fees and dues to the Union.  
Section 5. Should the present Federal law be amended during the term of  
this Agreement to allow compulsory membership in the Union on the date of  
employment, or on any period less than eight (8) days from the commencement of  
employment, this clause is hereby automatically changed to include such  
amendments as of the effective date of the law.

employee who he has been an employee of the Company,  
provided said employee has worked for the Employer  
during a period of six (6) months preceding the date of

contractor may seek additional relief from the fair  
percentage provisions contained herein from the Local  
Union Business Manager who will be responsible to  
explore and rectify issues relating to relief from the fair  
percentage clause. Such request can be made in writing or  
by phone with an explanation as to why the relief is being  
sought. The Local Union Business Manager shall have 48  
hours from receipt of the request to respond to the  
contractor. If the request is denied by the Local Union  
Business Manager, the Contractor may submit a request  
with a written explanation of why the relief should be  
granted to the President of the Massachusetts Laborers’  
District Council.  
The Massachusetts Laborers’ District Council President  
shall convene a meeting of its Executive Board within 48  
hours of receiving a request for fair percentage relief. The

employ Laborers on its payroll. However, the general contractor or construction  
manager shall have the ultimate responsibility to make certain that a steward is  
present when required by this Article. Said Steward shall be the only steward on  
the project.  
The Employer shall give the Union at least forty-eight (48) hours written

are waived.  
In the event a layoff of employees is to occur, the steward shall be notified  
as to the layoff no later than 3:30 p.m. on the date of the layoff. The Steward shall  
be the first Laborer other than the foreman to be recalled after a temporary layoif.

direction, and shall receive a guaranteed forty (40) hours pay per week.  
For the purpose of directing Laborers, on all operations where seven (7) or  
more Laborers are employed, a Laborer foreman shall be selected by the  
Employer. The second Laborer foreman shall be supplied by the Local Union that  
has the territorial jurisdiction in the area where the job is located and such  
additional Laborer foremen shall be acceptable to the Employer. The third  
Laborer foreman shall be selected by the Employer and the fourth by the Local

In the event a jurisdictional dispute arises then, the disputing unions shall  
request the other union or unions involved to send representatives to the job site to  
meet with representatives of the Union and Employer to settle the dispute. If  
unanimous agreement is not reached at the meeting, the Union shall request that its  
International Union assign a representative who shall make arrangements to meet  
representatives of the other International Union or Unions involved and  
representatives of the Employer on the job site to seek settlement of the dispute.  
The Employer shall also request the International Unions involved to assign  
representatives to seek settlement of the dispute.  
If the above procedures, or any other mutually agreed upon procedure, fails  
to resolve the problem, then the Employer at the request of the Union, agrees to  
participate in a tripartite arbitration with all the disputing parties. The impartial  
umpire to hear the dispute can be mutually agreed upon by the parties, or  
appointed by the American Arbitration Association.  
Decisions rendered by any of the above procedures shall be final, binding  
and conclusive on the Employer and the Union parties to this Agreement.  
There shall be no strikes, picketing or lockouts over any jurisdictional dispute.  
Maintenance of Operations on Projects  
To prevent jurisdictional disputes from arising on projects or over the  
method of starting a project, Employers are directed to follow the procedures  
outlined below.  
Employer’s Responsibility  
The Employer who has the responsibility for the performance and installation shall  
make a specific assignment of the work which is included in its contract. For  
instance, if Employer A subcontracts certain work to Employer B, then Employer  
B shall have the responsibility for making the specific assignment for the work  
included in its contract. If Employer B in turn shall subcontract certain work to  
Employer C, then Employer C shall have the responsibility for making the specific  
15  
assignment for the work included in its contract. The Employer shall not hold up  
disputed work or shut down a project on account of a jurisdictional dispute.

work at the regular starting time and no work is provided for him on the day that  
he is so ordered to report, he shall receive reporting time pay equivalent to two (2)  
hours at the regular straight time hourly rate. If the person has been working  
regularly, and the Employer has failed to notify him not to report for work before  
leaving his residence, he shall be entitled to two (2) hours reporting time pay at the  
regular straight time hourly rate, and this two (2) hour reporting time pay shall not  
be subject to the weather provisions of Section 5 of this Article VII. To be eligible  
for reporting time pay as provided herein, the employee must remain at the job site  
and be available for work unless told by the Employer that he may leave.  
Section 2. Employees shall furnish their Employer with current telephone  
number or other contact at the start of each job, and advise the Employer of any  
subsequent change or changes in such contact during the course of the job.

available for work throughout such period.  
Section 4. Any employee who reports for work and who works four (4) or  
more hours in any one (1) day shall receive the equivalent of not less than eight (8)  
hours pay at the regular straight time hourly rate provided that he is available for  
work until the end of that regular work day.  
16  
Section 5. It is expressly provided, however, that if the employee leaves  
the job site without permission of the Employer, or when a person refuses to work  
or continue to work, or when work stoppages brought about by a third party or  
parties prevent or make ill-advised, in the opinion of the Employer, the  
performance or continuance of work, or when weather makes work impractical,  
payment for time not actually worked shall not be required.  
Section 6. Where notification of the men is required under this Agreement  
to the effect that work shall not be performed on a particular day, notification of  
such fact to the steward shall be sufficient notification to the men, provided the

The parties hereby incorporate by reference, as part of this agreement, the  
“Apprenticeship Standards For Construction Craft Laborer” adopted by the parties  
on January 26, 1998.  
Employers employing one or more apprentice(s) shall participate in the  
4000 hour Massachusetts Laborers District Council Apprentice Program under the  
above-referenced standards for construction craft laborer.  
A.  
New applicants for membership who cannot provide reasonable proof of

alternatively, cannot demonstrate equivalent skills in a placement  
examination administered by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training  
Committee (JATC) shall, whenever, possible, enter the Apprenticeship  
program. Any person entering but failing to maintain and complete his or  
her Apprenticeship shall not be employed by the Employer as a Journey  
Worker under this Agreement. The failure of any Apprentice to maintain  
his or her Apprenticeship status shall obligate the Employer to discharge  
such person upon notice from the Union.  
The Apprenticeship and Training Standards approved by the U.S.  
Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, and the  
Massachusetts Department of Labor and Training are hereby incorporated  
by reference as a part of this Agreement.  
44  
The Apprentice wage rates:  
Hours of Credit Wage Rate  
0— 999 60% of Journey Worker  
1,000 — 1,999 70% of Journey Worker  
2,000 — 2,999 80% of Journey Worker  
3,000 — 3,999 90% of Journey Worker  
4,000 — over Journey Worker  
The Employer may pay a higher rate at its option. However, the Apprentice  
must meet his or her commitments to the Joint Apprenticeship Committee  
regardless of the level being paid.  
The Employer shall pay an Apprentice the full fringe benefit package as  
described in this contract.  
Entry into the Apprenticeship Program shall be controlled by the JATC,  
which shall employ appropriate testing and screening procedures. An  
Apprentice advances from one hours-of-credit and wage-rate category to  
another only upon determination of satisfactory performance by the JATC,  
which shall have the authority to grant accelerated credit where warranted  
by the performance of an individual apprentice.  
The Employer shall participate in the Apprenticeship Program by accepting  
apprentices for employment upon referral by the Union. The employer is  
not obligated to accept more than one (1) Apprentice for every five (5)  
Journey Workers commencing with the sixth laborer employed.  
The Employer may not employ an Apprentice until at least one Journey  
Worker is employed and thereafter may not employ more than one (1)  
Apprentice for every additional three (3) Journey Workers.  
An Apprentice should, whenever possible, be rotated by the Employer  
through different types of work so as to become trained in a variety of  
operations and work skills. Where the Employer is unable to provide an  
Apprentice with experience in the full range of craft skills, the JATC may  
request the Local Union to reassign the Apprentice to other employment in  
order to provide that experience. For so long as the Employer is able to  
provide the necessary range of employment experience, the Employer may  
45  
choose to retain the apprentice from job to job but shall notify the Local  
Union and JATC of all reassignments.  
An Apprentice shall not work on the jobsite unless supervised by a Journey  
Worker.  
An Apprentice shall not be penalized for taking off from work to attend  
offsite training (though time off for training is unpaid).  
It is the intent of the parties that this provision will not result in the  
displacement of Journey Workers.  
These provisions calling for the hiring of apprentices are not applicable to  
instances where the employer is recalling to employment employees who  
have worked for that company in the past year and these provisions apply  
only when the employer is hiring new employees.  
The Employer, whenever possible, may contact the apprentice program well  
in advance of hiring apprentices and arrange with the apprentice program  
for the training of apprentices to meet that employer’s specific contemplated

Section I. It is the good faith intention of the parties hereto that, by the  
execution of this Agreement, industrial peace shall be brought about and that the  
Union and the Employer shall cooperate to the end that work may be done  
efficiently and without interruption.  
Section 2. If any difference of opinion or dispute should arise between the  
parties as to the interpretation or application of this Agreement, other than a  
jurisdictional dispute, a complaint will be made by the aggrieved party  
46  
immediately. In each case, the first attempt at settlement shall be made between  
the Business Manager of the Local Union and the contractor-employer or his  
representative.  
Section 3. Disputes which cannot be adjusted between the contractor-  
employer and the Local Union within forty-eight (48) hours after they arise shall  
be referred to either the Labor Relations Division of the Associated General  
Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc., the Building Trades Employers’ Association of  
Boston and Eastern Massachusetts, Inc. and the Massachusetts Laborers’ District  
Council of the Laborers’ International Union of North America.  
Section 4. If, within forty-eight (48) hours, no adjustment or settlement 1s  
resolved by the procedures of Section 3 above, either party may submit the issue to  
arbitration.  
Section 5. Arbitration Procedure Both parties to this Agreement agree to  
settle all disputes or grievances involving or arising out of the interpretation or  
application of the provisions of this Agreement, except for jurisdictional disputes  
or as otherwise provided herein, to an Arbitration Board composed of two (2) from  
each party. The party submitting the issue to arbitration shall notify the other  
party at once in writing, and a meeting to consider and to act in the matter shall  
take place within three (3) days. Work is to be continued during the arbitration. If  
a tie vote exists, then an umpire shall be chosen by them, to whom the matter in  
dispute shall be referred, whose decision shall be final and binding on both sides.  
If an impartial umpire cannot be agreed upon within five (5) days, the arbitrator  
shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association and the arbitration  
will be conducted under the voluntary labor arbitration rules of the American  
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall not have the power to amend, add to  
or alter the provisions of this Agreement and his decision will be final and binding  
on both sides. The cost of the arbitration will be equally borne by both parties.  
Section 6. Nothing contained herein shall require the Massachusetts  
Laborers’ District Council to process any Local Union or employee grievance  
which, in its opinion, would be without merit, and no employee shall have the  
right to arbitrate his grievance should the Union deem it without merit.

Effective on the execution date of this Agreement, the Union agrees that in  
the event it subsequently grants more favorable terms and conditions, other than  
those contained within this agreement, to any competing employer or association,  
the Union will extend those same terms and conditions to the parties to this  
Agreement. The above provisions shall not apply to any action taken by the  
Market Recovery and Retention Committee established by Article XXX below.  

### ARTICLE XXIX  
### MARKET RECOVERY AND RETENTION COMMITTEE  
### 
   
It is hereby understood and agreed by and between the Union and the  
Associations that, for the term of the collective bargaining agreement commencing  
June 1, 2008 and expiring by its terms on May 31, 2012, there shall be established  
a Market Recovery Committee, consisting of four (4) members, one member shall  
be the Business Manager for the District Council, or his designee, who shall be the  
Chairman of the Committee; one shall be the Business Manager of the Local  
Union in whose jurisdiction the particular job or project is located; one shall be  
the Association representing the employer; and one shall be the signatory  
employer involved in the particular job or project. The purpose and authority of  
48  
the Market Recovery Committee shall be to consider and, where appropriate, grant  
requests for modifications on a job by job basis from negotiated contractual  
conditions as provided for by this Article.  
In recognition of the current downturn in the construction industry within  
Massachusetts, the parties hereto have agreed to consider appropriate action to  
place signatory contractors in a better competitive position in the marketplace.  
Accordingly, for any job bid from and after June 1, 2008, and during the term of  
this Agreement, a signatory contractor may request and the Market Recovery and  
Retention Committee by majority vote may grant, any and all of the following  
modifications of contractual conditions where warranted by competitive  
conditions:  
]. A carry over on the hourly wage rate in effect at the time the job is bid for  
the duration of the job or for one (1) year beyond the contractual expiration of that  
rate, whichever may occur first; in that event upon expiration of the bid rate,  
employees shall receive the contractual wage rate then in effect;  
2. A special wage rate of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the basic  
wage rate for alteration, repair, renovation, remodeling work, maintenance  
projects, and new construction work of any kind not subject to federal, state, city  
or town predetermined wage and fringe benefit rates;  
3. A condition that allows the contractor to retain a non-signatory specialty  
subcontractor on jobs below $100,000 provided the Employer notifies the Council  
prior to its bid that it is unable to locate a suitable, signatory subcontractor; to  
request this condition, the Employer must notify the Council reasonably in  
advance of the submission of bids for the job;  
4. A condition that allows the contractor to schedule four (4) ten (10) hour  
days on a Monday-Friday basis at straight-time;  
5. A condition that allows a Saturday make-up day at straight-time in the  
event time is lost during the regular work week due to inclement weather,  
provided the entire laborer crew and associated trades are sent home on that day.  
Any time worked in such week beyond forty (40) hours must be paid at the  
overtime rate; make-up time for Saturday shall be at least eight (8) hours in  
duration and shall not be mandatory. If any other associated trades on the job  
receive premium pay for the Saturday, then laborers shall receive premium pay.  
49  
6. It is understood that there may be instances when suitable, competitive  
union subcontractors may not be available for certain subcontracts. In such  
instances, the Employer may request of the Union, in a timely manner prior to bid  
or the award, that the Union endeavor to locate suitable, competitive union  
subcontractors to bid for the work. If the Employer and the Union are unable to  
locate such suitable, competitive subcontractors, in accordance with a good faith  
effort pursuant to the above procedure, it is understood and agreed that the  
Employer shall be relieved of the subcontracting clause [Article II, section 7] for  
such subcontractors; provided however, that the subcontractor selected by the  
Employer must be a responsible contractor who provides workers’ compensation  
insurance for all laborers on the project and does not misclassify any employees as  
“independent contractors.” This section shall not apply on any project within  
Zone | or covered by a Project Labor Agreement (PLA).  
7. Any disputes under Section 6 above as to whether a union subcontractor  
is suitable, competitive, whether the Employer notified the Union in a timely  
manner, or whether a non-union subcontractor is responsible and complies with  
the standards set forth in this section, or a fair percentage should be applied on a  
project are to be exclusively resolved by a four person committee convened under  
the first paragraph of this Article The chairman shall convene the committee  
within forty-eight (48) hours and a decision shall be reached that day. Any  
decisions of the panel shall be by majority vote and shall apply to only that  
particular job which was considered by committee and shall be final, binding and  
conclusive on all parties signatory to this Agreement and the Local Union  
involved in the job.
