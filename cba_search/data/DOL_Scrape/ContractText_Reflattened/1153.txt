funds allocated as Supplemental Dues held by the Trustees on his behalf the sum designated in Appendix “F”  
for each hour of his employment (hours worked or paid) in each payroll period, as special Supplemental Dues  
owed by the employee to the Union.  
B. The Union shall bear the entire responsibility for obtaining the written authorization from the employee and  
furnishing the authorization to the Board of Trustees in a form satisfactory to the Trustees. All costs, expenses  
and fees of the Board of Trustees incident to the accounting. administration and remittance to the Union of the  
Supplemental Dues payments shall be borne solely and entirely by the Union. The Contractors and Union agree  
to amend the Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the Operating Engineers Vacation-Holiday Trust for the  
purpose of authorizing, allocating and distributing the foregoing sums. The provision shall in no way affect the  
obligation of the Contractor to pay the full amount of vacation contributions specified in this Agreement.  
C. All written authorizations referred to above shall be irrevocable for a period of one (1) year from the date of the  
execution and shall renew automatically from year-to-year thereafter, unless the employee has served written  
notice upon the Board of Trustees and on the Union, not more than twenty (20) days and not less than ten (10)  
days prior to the expiration of each period of one (1) year or of the period of this Agreement, whichever is sooner,  
terminating the authorization.  

### ARTICLE Xvill  
### Contract Administrative Fund  
### 
The parties of this Agreement hereby establish a Contract Administrative Fund in the amount of four cents ($0.04) per  
hour which shall be reported to the Operating Engineers Trust Fund.  
Said contributions shall be made by members of their respective associations only, and shall not apply to any other  
employers.  
The monies shall be used for the administration of the associations only. and shall not be used for any other purpose. A  
reasonable fee shall be charged by the Trust Fund for the collection and distribution of the amount collected to the  
various construction associations.  
The contractors shall have the right to allocate an additional two cents (50.02) per hour during the life of the Agreement  
to the Contract Administrative Fund contribution.  

### ARTICLE XIX  
### Delinquency and Collection Procedure  
### 
A. The Trustees of the Trust Funds, through their Administrator, shall give written notice to a delinquent  
Contractor with a copy to the Union, advising the Contractor to correct a delinquency within ten (10) days of the  
piving of such notice. Any dispute between the parties, or between the Trustees and a Contractor, concerning  
the payment or non-payment of monies due the Trust Funds shall not be subject to Article V (concerning  
procedures for settlement of grievances) of this Agreement. The Union may withhold service from any or all  
jobs of such delinquent Contractor after said ten (10) day period, if the delinquency is not corrected and if the  
delinquency involves a failure by the Contractor to make payments on behalf of its employees. In this event, the  
provisions of Articles [Il and V of this Agreement sha!] not apply to any such delinquent Contractor, regardless  
of any change of name or association, until after all delinquent amounts owed to the Trust Funds have been paid  
in full.  
B. The Trustees of the Trust Funds, through their Administrator, shall furnish the Contractor Association and the  
Union a list of delinquent Contractors each month. Because the furnishing of services by a Subcontractor who  
   
   
has not made the appropriate fringe benefit payments serves to undermine the standards of this Agreement  
and to deprive employees who would otherwise be having fringe benefit contributions paid on their behalf of the  
opportunity for employment, the Contractor agrees that it shall not subcontract any portion of his job to any  
such Subcontractor. The Contractor agrees that he will not subcontract any portion of his job to any Contractor  
whose name appears on the delinquent list. unless the delinquent Contractor has paid all delinquent monies to  
the various Trust Funds.  
In the event the Contractor subcontracts to any delinquent Subcontractor, in violation of the foregoing, the  
Contractor shal! be liable to the Trustees for all accrued delinquencies of the Subcontractor, provided, however,  
that the amount of the Contractor’s liability shall not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or ten (10%)  
percent of the gross subcontract price, whichever is greater. The Contractor shall withhold sufficient funds  
from monies due or to become due such Subcontractor and shall pay the sums over to the Trust Funds. Ifa  
Subcontractor becomes delinquent after commencing work for the Contractor, the Contractor shall be liable for  
all delinquencies incurred on the job after ten (10) days following the date of the delinquency list on which the  
Subcontractor’s name first appeared. The Contractor shall terminate the contract of the Subcontractor who  
fails to promptly correct his delinquency. This Section C shall be enforceable only through a lawsuit.  
An Employer who pays any amounts to the Trust Funds under protest and claims a right to recover such  
amounts shall be considered delinquent to the Trust Funds until the dispute concerning such amounts is finally  
resolved. Any Subcontractor who is on a payment proposal and remains current in his payment schedule shall  
be removed from the delinquent list.  
The Contractor has a duty to report to the Trust Funds as required by the Agreement. The Contractor shall  
maintain for a period not less than five (5) years all payroll and related records showing all payments to persons  
or firms for work of the nature covered by this Agreement. The Contractor shall make available such records  
for audit by the Union Trust Funds Representative upon written request. The Contractor and the Union agree  
that such audits are expensive and time consuming for the Trust Funds and the Contractor, but the Trust  
Funds otherwise have no way of knowing the full extent of the Contractor's obligations, since the records  
showing the related employment are in the possession and control of the Contractor. In order to minimize the  
need for and frequency of such audits, the Contractor agrees that the Trustees and the Union place trust and  
confidence in the Contractor to report and pay contributions properly. For these reasons, if an audit by the  
Trust Funds discovers that the Contractor has failed to report and pay properly as required by this Agreement,  
the Trust Fund's right to sue for the Contractor’s failure to pay shall begin to run from the date of the audit in  
which the delinquent amounts are discovered.  
An Employer who refuses to permit an audit by authorized representatives of the Trust Funds shall be  
considered delinquent to the Trust Funds, and shall he liable to the Trust Funds for all jegal costs, including -  
attorney fees, incurred by the Trust Funds in obtaining the audit, regardless of whether the audit finds any  
delinquent contributions due.  
All signatory Employers who fail to send the monthly report form as required by the various Trust Funds  
whether any employees are employed or not, shall be considered delinquent to the Trust Funds. An Employer  
may notify the Trust Funds, by certified mail, of his desire to be deleted from the official mailing list for the  
period of time in which he will not be employing persons covered by this Agreement. Such notification or deletion  
Shall not affect in any way the Employer’s obligation to abide by all terms of this Agreement.  
All signatory Employers found to be delinquent shall pay for all tegal expenses, including attorney fees, and  
auditing costs in connection with such delinquency, plus liquidated damages in the amount of Twenty-Five  
Dollars ($25.00) or ten (10%) percent of the total sum of the contributions, whichever is greater, to the Trust  
Fund to which the delinquent contributions were owed.

Participation Agreement with the Operating Engineers Trust covering such employee(s) for the term of employ-  
ment involved,  
The obligation under this Section I shall not apply to a bona fide year-end, mid-year. or job completion honus  
which the Contractor establishes to the satisfaction of the Trusts is not a disguised attempt to pay wages or to  
pay a bonus in lieu of wages.  
J. The terms “Trustees” and “Trust Funds” as used in this Article, mean and refer ¢o those several Trusts and  
Board of Trustees established and maintained pursuant to Articles VHI, [X, X, XI, and XII (jointly and severally,

The parties signatory hereto have established a Certification Examination for all operators of cranes in excess  
of a 5-ton lifting capacity. A committee of not less than three (3) management representatives and three (3)  
union representatives appointed by the Training and Retraining Trust shall establish the protocol for the  
Certification Examination and its revisions. Each member of the committee must have full knowledge of the  
skills and necessary requirements for the crane operations that the examination (s) will cover.  
The address for testing shall he at the Operating Engineers and management's training site at 2190 Pellisier  
Place, Whittier. In addition, the testing site may he designated at an employer's place of business or some other  
location designated by the management/union committee to give a test to all operators. Irrespective of the test  
site, testing is to be conducted by an independent and impartial testing organization. The independent and  
impartial testing organization will be selected from a list of at least five (5) candidates invited to offer proposals  
and establish qualifications to the Committee. In the event one (1) candidate cannot be selected by mutual  
agreement, the Committee will alternately strike names from the list until one (1) candidate remains. At the  
end of one (1) year of service to the testing program or anyanniversary date thereafter, either the union or the  
management committee will have the unqualified right to terminate the current independent testing organiza-  
tion and the entire selection process will be repeated. The cost associated with the testing is the sole responsi-  
bility of the Training and Retraining Trust.  
All operators must initially participate in the written and practical test with no execption. In the event the  
operator is applying for certification of more than one (1) type and size of crane, each operator must pass the  
written and practical “hands on” test for each specific crane separately. Ali operators at 2 minimum must pass  
a Department of Transportation physica! and a substance abuse test before making an application for testing.  
At the end of the five (5) calendar years, each operator must take a current written exam, and provide current  
proof of passing a Department of Transportation physical and substance abuse test. A practical exam would  
also be required if the operator is unable to document at least 1000 hours of experience during the immediately  
preceding certification period, operating the crane or hoisting equipment for which re-certification is sought.  
a. An operator applying for re-certification and not wishing to take the practical exam must provide a  
complete employment record of 1000 hours of work history on cranes or hoisting equipment that re-  
certification is sought, within the previous five (5) year period. The employment record must include but  
is not limited to the following items,  
(1) Name, address, telephone number, verifying supervisors at past and present employment cover-  
ing the past three (3) calendar years.  
(2) Make and model of cranes or hoisting and equipment operated.  
(3) Total hours of operation for this employee  
b. Waiver of the practical examination will only he granted after review and verification of the employment  
record.
