### ARTICLE 3  
### HOURS OF WORK  
### 
Section 1.  
The Company's regular workweek begin at Mid-  
night on Sunday and end at Midnight the following  
Sunday.  
Section 2.  
An employee's workday shall begin at the time the  
employee starts to work and shall continue for twenty-  
four (24) consecutive hours, but in no event will an  
employee's workday begin earlier than twenty-four (24)  
hours following the beginning of the preceding workday.  
Section 3.  
It is understood and agreed that the Company shall  
2  
have the right to schedule shifts both on a fixed and  
rotating basis beginning and ending at times made  
necessary by the Company's production requirements.  
The Company will give the Union and the affected  
employees one (1) week's notice of any changes in the  
starting and ending times of such entire shifts, unless  
the reasons requiring the changes make it impractical  
to give such notice.  
Section 4. Overtime  
It is mutually agreed that the Company's operations  
may require performance of overtime work, in recogni-  
tion of this, the Parties agree that overtime require-  
ments will be filled either by voluntary overtime oppor-  
tunities or mandatory overtime work. Employees may  
be relieved of their obligation to work mandatory over-  
time if volunteers are obtained prior to the start of the  
mandatory overtime.  
A. Voluntary Overtime.  
1. Definition. Voluntary overtime is when an employee  
requests or agrees to volunteer to work an overtime  
opportunity,  
2. Removal From Voluntary Overtime Consideration.  
Employees who do not want to work voluntary overtime  
must sign a statement with their appropriate manage-  
ment representative and a copy presented to the Local  
Union. Such employee will not be asked for voluntary  
overtime until he notifies the Company and Union in  
writing of his desire. At such time he will be charged the  
highest number of opportunities for overtime work he  
3  
normally performs. This provision will not excuse the  
employee from their turn for mandatory overtime.  
B. Equalization of Overtime Opportunities,  
1. It ts agreed that overtime work will be offered on a  
reasonably equal basis, catculated to the  
employees who normally perform such work. However,  
no employees will be paid for time not actually worked  
under this Section, and in the event employees do not  
receive their proportionate share of overtime work as  
provided herein, such will be given prefer-  
ence until they have reached their proportionate share,  
as provided in Paragraph B 4 below.  
2. The Company will maintain and post a uniform  
overtime sheet for each job classification and shift  
showing overtime opportunities provided for the em-  
ployees who normally perform the work, as well as a  
record of alt overtime worked by employees outside of  
the classification. The overtime sheets will be uniform  
across all classifications and work areas, and will  
include codes identifying the opportunities.  
3. Monthly overtime sheets will be made available for  
inspection by the employee during the first week of the  
month. Employees will be responsible to examine, sign  
and report any errors during that week.  
4. Employees who are low in opportunities will be  
given preference the following month for overtime work  
within their classification on work they normally per-  
form.  
5. On a monthly bais the Steward and appropriate  
management representative will review the overtime  
sheets. Supervisors will be reasonably available to  
meet with shop stewards to review overtime sheets. If  
inequities for opportunities exist a plan of action will be  
agreed upon to correct the problem. Should the parties  
be unable to agree upon aplan of action or should a plan  
not be followed, the Steward will refer the matter to the  
Business Agent who will meet with the Plant Industrial  
Relations Supervisor to establish corrective action. If  
the Union believes the inequity continues, the Union  
Business Agent may meet with the Plant Manager.  
Where it is agreed an inequity exists the Plant Manager  
will meet with the management Leader to ensure that a  
plan is developed to address the inequity.  
6. In order to equalize the overtime of a person who is  
being transferred from one department or from one job  
to another, he will be credited with the highest total of  
accumulated overtime incurred on the new job in that  
department.  
7. Employees who are assigned or transferred to a job  
other than a bargaining unit job will be credited, upon  
return to the bargaining unit, with the total of the  
overtime hours he worked in the non-unit job or the  
overtime hours worked of the highest employee in the  
job classification that the employee is returning to in the  
bargaining unit, whichever is higher.  
8. All overtime sheets will be zeroed out effective upon  
ratification of the contract. The Company will agree to  
review specific problem areas identified by the Union  
and not zero out those hours until mutually agreed that  
5  
the problem has been addressed, and corrected if  
possible.  
C. Mandatory Overtime.  
1. Definition. Mandatory overtime refers to any over-  
time the employee is required to work for which the  
employee did not volunteer.  
2. Employees will work up to, but not exceeding, four  
(4) hours mandatory overtime per workday for up to Six  
(6) times per month, subject to the following provisions:  
a. Employees will be permitted to refuse manda-  
tory overtime up to four (4) times per rolling twelve (12)  
months. Documentation of each refusal will be provided  
to the employee. Emptoyees will be expected to sign  
the documentation of each refusal and will receive a  
copy thereof. Each employee who works mandatory  
overtime more than six (6) times in a calendar month will  
be granted an additional refusal for each mandatory  
overtime work, that cannot be used in the immediately  
following ten (10) working days, but must be used  
during the rolling twelve (12).month period. A refusal of  
overtime in excess of the number permitted under this  
Article 3, Section C will result in immediate termination.  
b, Overtime for vacations and other known vacan-  
cies may be scheduled at least seven days in advance.  
For other vacancies that may occur, employees as-  
signed mandatory overtime will generally be notified at  
least 48 hours in advance. in instances where the  
vacancy is not known 48 hours in advance, notice will  
6  
be given as soon as is reasonable after the vacancy is  
known.  
c. Itis understood that if the Company is unable to  
meet its manning requirements, as it has determined,  
through volunteers and/or the use of mandatory over-  
time, the Company has the right to fill its requirements  
from any source it deems appropriate from within the  
bargaining unit. Under this section, an employee work-  
ing in a job other than his or her regular job will receive  
the rate of his or her regular job or the rate of the job to  
which he or she works, whichever is higher.  
d. Employees who volunteer to work another  
employee's mandatory overtime, the employee who  
was going to work mandatory overtime will be credited  
with working the mandatory overtime.  
e. Employees will not be picked up on the manda-  
tory overtime rotation for any reason, when returning to  
work, except for a reported absence, unreported ab-  
sence or leaving early on their scheduled shift,  
until their next regular turn in order occurs. It is agreed  
that if an employee leaves early on overtime it will be  
recorded as a “leave early” pursuant to Article 8,  
Section 4, and the employee will not be credited as  
having worked a mandatory overtime under this Article,  
but will be charged with an overtime opportunity.  
f. Employees required to work overtime for a pe-  
riod of four (4) housr after their regular shift will be  
permitted a company phone to cali home.  
g. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Com-  
7  
pany from requiring an employee to work mandatory.  
overtime in the hours immediately preceding or follow-  
ing his or her regularly schedule shift. Employees who  
are given less than 24 hours notice of the requirement  
to work mandatory overtime in the hours immediately  
preceding his or her regularly scheduled shift will re-  
ceive double the straight time hourly rate for these  
mandatory overtime hours.  
h. Itis agreed that the Company will not temporarily  
transfer employees from one job classification to an-  
other for the purpose of shifting overtime.  
i. Mandatory overtime will be rotated from the  
junior employee to the senior employee in each group.  
D. Maintenance Overtime  
Maintenance overtime will be first offered to employees  
who normally perform such work, in the following order:  
1. Daylight employees will be offered daylight over-  
time.  
2. Shift employees will be offered shift overtime.  
3. In the event no employees desire the overtime on  
days, the Company will offer the overtime to shift  
employees who are available.  
4. In the event no employees desire the overtime on  
shift, the Company will offer the overtime to daylight  
employees who are available.  
8  
5. Inthe event the Company cannot obtain voluntary  
overtime in the above manner, the junior employee  
either on the daylight shift or the junior employee on  
shift, will work the overtime in his group. Mandatory  
overtime will be rotated from the junior employee to the  
senior employee in each group. Daylight employee  
overtime will be equalized. Shift employee overtime will  
be equalized.

2. Departmental seniority shall mean an employee's  
length of service dating from his last date of hire into, or  
permanent transfer into, a department within the plant,  
which department shal! also be known as his home  
department. Employees cannot carry department se-  
niority in more than one department at any one time.  
3. Protected seniority shall mean the total department  
seniority which an employee had in his last home  
department at the time he was permanently transferred  
into his present department. Employees cannot carry  
protected seniority in more than one department at any  
one time.  
4. Temporary department seniority shall mean the  
time employees accumulate in departments other than  
their home department as a result of a cutback or recall.  
B. In applying seniority as provided hereinafter as  
between employees with equal department seniority,  
plant seniority will be the determining factor. If plant and  
department seniority are equal, the employee with the  
lowest clock number shall be considered the senior  
employee. In application of plant seniority, where plant  
seniorities are the same, the employee with the lowest  
clock number shall be considered the senior employee.  
In application of the protected seniority where the  
protected seniority is the same, plant seniority shall be  
the determining factor and where the plant seniority is  
the same, the employee with the lowest clock number  
shall be considered the senior employee.  
C. New employees shail be regarded as probationary  
employees for the first ninety (90) working days of

tionary period, During said probationary period, the  
Company shall have the absolute right to lay off,  
transfer, discipline or discharge such employees with-  
out recourse on the part of such employees or the Union

tionary employees will be entitled to leaves of absence  
as outlined in Article 9 except leaves of absence time  
will not count toward completing the probationary pe-  
riod. Upon completion of such probationary period the  
employees will be credited with seniority from the date  
of hire. The Company shall at all times be the sole judge  
of whom it shall hire.  
D. New employees will be afforded the opportunity to  
sign check-off authorization and the Union application  
blanks upon receiving employment. After the proba-

the seniority rights of the employees involved in such  
new, rearranged or meshed departments.  
Section 3. Seniority Rosters  
The Company wil prepare and post on the bulletin  
boards at the end of each quarter a seniority roster  
showing the department, plant and protected seniority  
of each employee.  
A copy of the seniority roster will be furnished to the  
Union. Unless a protest is made concerning the senior-  
ity standing of any employee within thirty (30) days after  
the posting of the roster, then such roster and seniority  
standing shown thereon shall be conclusively deemed  
to be correct.  
Section 4.  
An employee's continuous service and his seniority will  
16  
be considered terminated if he:  
A. Quits or is discharged:  
B. Is furloughed for a period of eighteen (18) consecu-  
tive months or if the employee has three (3) or more

Company agrees to advise employees as soon as it  
knows or can reasonably ascertain whether a reduction  
17  
in force is expected to last less or longer than fifteen (15)  
days in order that employees may exercise the rights  
provided hereinafter. As used herein "Q-rated" means  
jobs on which the employee has received the qualified  
rate. A furloughed employee is an employee who is not  
working in the plant. A cutback employee is an em-  
ployee who has been displaced from his job but is  
working on another job in the plant.  
CURTAILMENTS  
OTHER THAN TEMPORARY  
A. Inthe event ofa curtailment, the following procedure  
will be used:  
4. employee is displaced from his job as a result  
of a reduction in force other than a temporary reduction  
in force as defined above, he may elect by the end of his  
second working day to take a voluntary furlough, or he  
must exercise his department seniority to displace the  
junior department seniority employee in his regular job  
classification on any shift in his department.  
2. Upon exhausting his department seniority in his  
regular job classification, the employee may elect by  
the end of his second working day to take a voluntary  
furlough or wil! roll the junior department seniority  
employee in any equivalent paying job on any shiftin his  
department on which he had been Q-rated. Employees  
previously Q-rated in jobs that have been combined or  
eliminated into newly created jobs will have curtailment/  
cutback rights to the newly created jobs. However, if  
such employee cannot displace an employee on an  
equivalent paying job, he will roll the junior department  
18  
—,  
seniority employee in the next lower paying job classi-  
fication on any shift in his department on which he has  
been Q-rated in descending order. As a last step before  
being displaced from his department, the employee  
with more department seniority may elect by the end of  
his second working day to take a voluntary furlough or  
will roll the junior department seniority employee on a  
beginning or exit job even though he is not Q-rated on  
such beginning or exit job provided he is capable of  
performing such beginning or exit job.  
3. Any employee who is displaced, by the above  
procedure may by the end of his second working day  
elect to take voluntary furlough or he must exercise his  
protected seniority from the last department from which  
he was permanently transferred. !n applying protected  
seniority to his last home department he shall first apply  
his seniority to the highest rated job classification on  
any shift in which he is Q-rated and if such employee  
has insufficient protected seniority to displace the junior  
department seniority employee in that job classifica-  
tion, he will then be allowed to use his protected  
seniority to roll the junior department seniority em-  
ployee in any equivalent paying job on any shift in this  
department on which he had been Q-rated. However, if  
such employee cannot displace an employee on any  
equivalent paying job, he will roll the junior department  
seniority employee’on the next lower paying job classi-  
fication on any shift in his department on which he has  
been Q-rated in descending order. As a last step before  
being displaced from the department from which he has  
protected seniority an employee with more protected  
seniority may elect by the end of his second working day  
to take a voluntary furlough or he will roll the junior  
19  
department seniority employee on @ beginning or exit  
job even though he is not Q-rated on such beginning or  
exit job, provided he is capable of performing such job.  
4. lf an employee has exhausted his depariment se-  
niority and his protected seniority, he may elect by the  
end of his second working day to take a voluntary  
furlough or he wilt be assigned by the Company to a job  
in another department, provided he has sufficient plant  
seniority and provided he is capable of performing such  
job in the following order:  
a. Where there is a vacancy on a beginning or exit job,  
provided that he is capable of performing such begin-  
ning or exit job and further provided that other employ-  
ees with more department and/or Plant seniority did not  
have prior claim on such vacant job.  
b. The job of the least senior employee in the Plant on  
a beginning or exit job.  
c. Appendix A lists beginning and exit jobs. Employ-  
ees who are assigned by the Company to an exit or  
beginning job, where there is a vacancy, will be as-  
signed on the basis of their Plant seniority to the highest  
job classification in which they had previously been Q-  
rated.  
d. Senior department employees in ajob classification  
being reduced by curtailment other than temporary may  
take a votuntary furlough by mutual agreement be-  
tween the Company and the Union. Employees in the  
affected classification have the responsibility to inform  
the Company of their request for a voluntary furlough  
20  
   
and must make this request within two working days  
after employees are notified of the  
TEMPORARY CURTAILMENTS  
B. 1. tf an employee is from his job as a  
result of a temporary reduction in force as defined  
above and such employee is not the junior department  
seniority employee in his job classification on his regu-  
lar shift, he will displace such junior department senior-  
ity employee in his job classification on his regular shift.  
2. Upon exhausting his department seniority in his  
regular job classification on his regular shift, the em-  
ployee will exercise his department seniority to roll the  
junior department seniority employee in any equivalent  
paying job on that shift in his department on which he  
had heen Q-rated; however, if such employee cannot  
displace an employee on any equivalent paying job, he  
will roll the junior departmental seniority employee in  
the next lower paying job classification on his regular  
shift in his department on which he has been Q-rated in  
descending order. Upon exhausting his department  
seniority on his shift, as a last step before being  
temporarily furloughed, such employee wilj roll the  
junior department seniority employee on a beginning  
job on any shift in his department even though he is not  
Q-rated on such beginning job provided he is capable of  
performing such job.  
3. If an employee is displaced from his department  
during a temporary curtailment, he will be placed on  
temporary furlough.  
21  
4. In temporary cutbacks, employees will not be en-  
titled fo take voluntary furlough but will take the job  
assignment as provided above.  
5. The beaming area and the Muititex area will be  
considered as separate departments under the tempo-  
rary curtailment provisions outlined in the Contract for  
curtailments lasting from 8 hours to a maximum of 4  
days. (This will pertain to primarily shutdowns related to  
Holiday curtailments.)  
RECALLS  
C. Employees will be recalled in the following order and  
subject to the following procedure:  
1. Furloughed employees lose all rights of recall and  
their employment will be terminated at the end of  
eighteen (18) consecutive months or thirty six (36)  
consecutive months, whichever is applicable, on fur-  
lough. A cutback employee does not Jose his recall  
rights regardless of the length of time he is in cutback  
status.  
2. An employee who has been displaced from a job  
other than a beginning job shall be entitled to recall in  
accordance with his department seniority to any va-  
cancy that arises in a job classification in his depart-  
ment for which he was Q-rated in ascending arder. An  
employee who has been displaced from a beginning job  
within a department will be entitled to recall to such  
beginning job in accordance with his department se-  
niority unless there is an employee on furlough who has  
more plant seniority than such employee and the em-  
22  
   
ployee on furlough with more plant seniority is capable  
of performing such beginning job and has indicated in  
writing a desire to be considered for jobs in such  
departments.  
3. Furloughed employees will be given preference  
over hiring new employees for work they are capable of  
performing in line with their plant seniority in depart-  
ments other than the departments from which they were  
furloughed, provided such furloughed employees have  
filed a written application for available work on such jobs  
with the Human Resources Office. Such right or prefer-  
ential consideration in other departments shall be avail-  
able to the employees for a period of eighteen (18)  
consecutive months or thirty six (36) consecutive  
months, whichever is applicable, from the date of their  
furlough. If pursuant to their request an employee is  
offered work in other departments and refuses or fails  
to accept such work he will forfeit his right to any other  
such work in any other such departments.  
4, The Company has the right to offer employees on  
furlough, jobs that they are capable of performing rather  
than hire new employees to fill such jobs. If none of the  
employees on furlough in line with their plant seniority  
are willing to accept such other jobs that are offered by  
the Company, then the Company shalt have the right to  
require the junior plant seniority employee who is Q-  
rated on such job to accept such job. Such junior plant  
seniority employee who fails and refuses within seven  
(7) days after notification to report to work on such job  
will be terminated and lose seniority.

CURTAILMENTS IN MAINTENANCE  
Section 6.  
For purposes of cutbacks and furloughs either tempo-  
rary or other than temporary and for purposes of recalls  
in the Maintenance Department, the Company shall  
determine the skills that must be retained or required  
and the areas in the Maintenance Department  
will be handled separately:  
. Mechanica!  
. Electrical  
. Utility  
. Alloy  
. Building and Grounds  
an & WG A) =  
In the event of any cutback, an employee in one of the  
above five (5) areas will not be allowed to use his  
department seniority for purposes of rolling an em-  
ployee in one of the above other listed areas unless:  
1. Such employee has been Q-rated in the area in  
which he seeks to displace a junior employee; and, in  
addition,  
2. Unless such employee has demonstrated by actual  
performance on the job that he is fully capable of  
performing ail of the job duties, skills and functions of  
the junior employee he seeks to displace.  
tn the event of a cutback within an area employees will  
be cutback on the basis of department seniority. it is  
recognized that in times of such cutback the Company  
25  
may assign cutback employees within the classification  
without regard to particular skills.  
The restrictions imposed above for cutbacks will apply  
for recails involving Maintenance Department employ-  
ees.  
Maintenance Department employees who have ex-  
hausted their department seniority as above set forth  
will then be entitled to use their protected seniority and/  
or plant seniority as in the case of all other employees  
provided hereinabove.  
The Union and the Company have acknowledged that  
various craft skills have been recognized within the  
Maintenance Department in the past. The Company  
has discussed with the Union that more efficient utiliza-  
tion of craft personnet is necessary in the competitive  
world in which we live. The objective is to utilize the craft  
work force as efficiently and effectively as possible  
without regard to jurisdictional constraints within the  
MMM, ELE and UEP job classifications. Assistance  
between classifications will be expected and incidental  
work will be routine.  
The Company has recognized the Union's concerns  
about the safety of it's workers and the fact that there  
will need to be additional training of Maintenance em-  
ployees. The Company agrees to provide this training  
and instruction on Company time. Employees will be  
expected to make good faith efforts to perform assigned  
work, Itis recognized that employees will not be subject  
to disciplinary action for work they are not capable of  
performing.  
26  
The Company agrees that these changes will not result  
in a cutback of craft personnel in Maintenance.  
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  
Section 7.  
In cutbacks and in recalls the Company will make every  
attempt to provide displacement rights and recall rights  
to affected employees as soon as practicable. It is  
understood that the determination of seniority rights of  
respective employees and the subsequent notification  
of employees will require some time. For this reason the  
Company will be allowed a reasonable time to accom-  
plish the seniority placements of employees both in  
cutback and in recail. If an employee or the Union feels  
that the Company has displaced an employee or re-  
called an employee in violation of the rights of such  
employee under the seniority provisions herein, a griev-  
ance may be filed and if it is later determined that the  
Company has, in fact, displaced or recalled an em-  
ployee in violation of his seniority rights as contained  
herein, then such employee will be entitled to any back  
pay such employee may have suffered by virtue of such  
violation beginning as of the shift following the filing of  
the grievance.  
Section 8.  
A. Employees displaced from their home seniority  
department and who take jobs in other departments by  
using protected seniority rights wit! not accumulate  
additional protected seniority rights while working in a  
cutback status in the department in which they carry  
protected seniority rights.  
2?  
B. Employees working in departments other than their  
home seniority department due to cutbacks whether  
they are working in such other department as a result of  
excercised protected seniority or plant seniority rights  
will accumulate temporary department seniority rights  
dating from the date of their last entry into such depart-  
ment by virtue of cutbacks which temporary department  
seniority may be used for purposes of job progression  
and cutbacks in such other department. Such tempo-  
rary department seniority will be lost when the em-  
ployee leaves the departmeni.  
C. An employee in a department as a result of exer-  
cised protected seniority may, at time of a cutback in  
that department, exercise his protected seniority or  
temporary department seniority, whichever is greater.  
D. Ifanemployee is working ina department otherthan  
his home department by reason of cutbacks and subse-  
quently such employee refuses recall to his regular job  
in his home department and elects to stay in his new  
department, the new department will become his home  
seniority department with seniority dating from his last  
date of entry into such other department whether such  
entry was by the exercise of plant seniority or protected  
seniority; and such employee's former home depart-  
ment seniority date to the date of his election not to  
return to such home seniority in his from home seniority  
department. He will then lose any former protected  
seniority in other departments.  
E. An employee who is cutback from his home depart-  
ment into his protected seniority department for a  
period of two (2) or more consecutive years wil) have the  
28  
option to assign his protected seniority and his tempo-  
rary department seniority to his cutback department as  
new department seniority. Employees who elect this  
option forfeit all recall rights to their former position.  
Employees will be responsible to notify the Company of  
their election of this option.  
Employees who are cutback and are notified by the  
Company that there is no intention of ever recalling  
them to their job, this option, even though they  
have not been cutback two (2) or more consecutive  
years.  
Section 9.  
Itis understood and agreed that in every instance where  
anemployee is assigned to a job classification for which  
he has not been Q-rated, whether such assignment of  
jobs be due to reassignments in times of cutback and  
recall or as a result of job bid and promotion, if such  
employee is unable to satisfactorily perform the job, he  
will be returned to the status from which he was  
assigned to the job classification and will not be eligible  
for assignment to that job classification for twelve (12)  
months.  
Section 10. PROMOTIONS  
A. Permanent vacancies within the unit  
(vacancies that the Company intends to fill which are  
expected to last sixty (60) or more days) other than  
vacancies in the Maintenance Department which pro-  
cedures are set forth in a separate section below, will be  
handled as follows: will be posted and will be filled from  
bidders from within the department who are capable of  
performing the jobs on the basis of department senior-  
ity. If there are no bidders within the department ca-  
29  
pable of performing the jobs then the jobs will be filled  
from those employees bidding from other departments  
who are capable of performing the jobs based on plant  
seniority and then by hiring new employees.  
B. The Company reserves the right to determine, from  
time to time, the number of employees and the skills  
required from employees in the Maintenance Depart-  
ment. In the event the Company determines that addi-  
tional employees will be required in a particular job  
Classification or to perform a particular skill within a job  
classification, it will post such job classification along  
with the skill requirements for such jobs and the jobs will  
be awarded on the basis of department seniority to  
employees within the department who are capable of  
performing, including the particular skills required as a  
part of such jobs. If there are no employees within a  
department who desire or are capable of fully perform-  
ing the jobs, then the jobs will be awarded to employees  
within the plant who are fully capable of performing such  
jobs and the skills as part of such jobs on the basis of  
plant seniority and then by hiring new employees.  
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM  
A. The Apprenticeship qualifications and program es-  
tablished by the Company shal! be a part of this  
Contract and shall continue in effect. Only employees  
working in the bargaining unit will be eligible to bid into  
the apprenticeship program.  
The following are the maximum periods that an em-  
ployee will remain in an apprenticeship slot, but it is  
understood that such maximum periods may be ex-  
30  
tended by mutual agreement of the Company and the  
Union:  
Third Class B Six (6) months  
Third Class Q Six (6) months  
Second Class B Twelve {12} months  
Second Class Q Fifteen (15) manths  
First Class B Fifteen (15) months  
The above are maximum periods, however, and if, in  
the judgment of the Company, an employee has devel-  
oped sufficient skills as to warrant his moving to the next  
apprenticeship slot in craft progression prior to such  
maximum time, the Company will move the employee  
accordingly.  
B. Bargaining unit employees that desire entrance into  
the Apprenticeship Program will sign the bid sheet  
outlining the basic requirements for entry into the pro-  
gram and the requirements for successful progression  
to the status of first class in a particular craft area.  
Apprenticeship vacancies wilt be filled by the plant  
senior employees who sign the bid sheet and fulfill the  
basic requirements outlined on it. The bid sheet will be  
posted for thirty (30) days.  
In an effort to upgrade craft capabilities the following  
procedures will be utilized in Atken's Apprenticeship  
Training Program.  
1. A detailed classroorn and training outline will be  
developed for each craft apprenticeship training pro-  
gram.  
31  
2. Successful bidders will be expected to take class-  
room work, make passing grades in such Classroom  
work, and perform satisfactorily on their job training  
assignments.  
3. If, at any time prior to earning a qualified first class  
rating, an apprentice leaves the program for any rea-  
son, he will return to his previous job with no loss of  
seniority. Such employee will not hold protected senior-  
ity in the apprenticeship program.  
4. During a period of cutbacks, apprentices will be  
cutback before any reductions are made to “Q" rated  
first class maintenance classifications.  
5, Apprentices who earn a first qualified maintenance  
classification through this program will not be able to  
displace departmental senior first class maintenance  
personnel in a period of cutbacks. Apprentices may be  
assigned to Maintenance periodically for the purposes  
of training while in a cutback status.  
6, Employees who bid jobs under the Apprenticeship  
Program may be required to attend Technical Schoolan  
average of two (2) evenings per week. Such schooling

(3) representatives from the Company and three (3)  
representatives appointed from the bargaining unit, by  
the Union, will monitor the Apprenticeship Training  
Program.  
32  
8. The apprentice training program will be utilized for  
vacancies in the Maintenance department except for  
Situations where positions must be filled on an immedi-  
ate basis to meet the operational needs of the Com-  
pany.  
C. In addition to the craft job classifications listed  
above, the Company may utilize the job classification of  
“chief” within each craft area. Itis recognized, however,  
that included in a particular craft area are many and  
varied skills. In order for an employee to be eligible to  
be awarded a bid to chief in a particular craft area, he  
must have demonstrated leadership ability, and by  
actual on-the-job performance demonstrated that he is  
fully capable of performing all of the job duties, Skills,  
and functions of the particular type of work within the  
Craft area covered by the job in which there is a  
vacancy.  
Craft employees who are working in another craft area  
in their job classification under the Company's training  
program will be eligible to bid for Chief Job tn their own  
Craft area. This provision will not apply to employees  
who have bid into another job classification, bid into  
another craft area under the job preference system or  
have been cut back from their craft asea or the depart-  
ment. Employees who bid to move under the job  
preference procedure in the maintenance department,  
will not be eligible for a chief job in the new craft area for  
a period of one year.  
in order to be eligible to be awarded the job of "chief" in  
a particular craft area, the senior employee meeting the  
established qualifications will be awarded the job. The  
33  
Company agrees to offer the senior department em-  
ployees in the particular craft area the right for addi-  
tional training for the purposes of advancement.  
D. 1. Jobs posted as provided herein will remain posted  
until all shifts on which there could be eligible bidders  
have worked one full eight (8) hour shift.  
2. Employees who are absent from the plant during the  
entire period during which a job is posted may, upon  
return to work, report to the Human Resources Office  
and place their name on the job bid sheet provided the  
job has not already been awarded.  
3. Permanent vacancies that reoccur within the same  
job classification within sixty (60) days from the date of  
a job posting for such job classification will not be  
reposted but will be filled from those who bid on the  
previous job bid sheet.  
E. The Company shall retain its right to make assign-  
ments to machines and places of work within a job  
classification as well as shift assignments within a job  
classification and there shall be no claim or rights to bid  
on shift assignments other than from a rotating shift to  
a daylight shift and/or locked straight shift jobs within  
the same job classification as provided herein and there  
shall be no claim or right to bid on a different machine  
or different job assignment within a job classification.

F, Any employee assigned to another job classification  
within his own department or another department as a  
result of job bidding, promotion or request for transfer  
will receive the beginner's rate for such job, unless he  
has been previously Q-rated on such job. If such  
employee is Q-rated on the new job to which he is  
assigned within his department, or another department  
then he will receive the Q-rate for such job at the time  
he begins working on such job and upon accepting such  
job. The employee will be considered on a trial basis for  
a period of not longer than the period indicated for that  
job in Appendix B, during which or at the end of such  
time the Company will determine whether such em-  
ployee can perform the job. The employee may elect to  
return to his former job during the first fifteen (15)  
working days after being placed on the new job, after  
which time the employee will not be allowed to voluntar-  
ily return to his former job. If he cannot perform the job  
or the employee elects to return to his former job or  
move to a lower-rated job, he wilt be ineligible to return  
to such job for a period of one (1) year except in cases  
of cutback. An employee on a beginner's rate will be  
considered on a trial basis for a period of not longer than  
the period indicated for that job in Appendix B, during  
which time or at the end of such time the Company will  
determine whether such employee has qualified to  
receive the Q-rate for the job. If he has so qualified, the  
employee will forfeit his right to return to the former job  
for one (1) year except in case of cutback and will at that  
time begin to receive the Q-rate for the job.  
During such trial period, the Company, at its discretion,  
may fill the employee's former job by temporary transfer  
or by posting such job for bid.  
35  
G. An employee filling a job vacancy created by job  
bidding, promotion or request for transfer will be consid-  
ered as temporarily filling the job until such time as the  
employee or Company exercises the option to remain  
on the new job or return to the former job. During such  
temporary period, the employee retains his right to  
return to his former job.  
H. Employees in the Maintenance Department in the  
job classification of MMM, ELE and UEP who desire to  
move from one work area to another will be considered  
for such vacancies when they occur, provided they  
have made a request in writing to the Maintenance

posted again.  
K. The following jobs will be filed within the plant by a  
job preference system.  
Fabrication: ABM, EFO, FSR

ordo last longer than sixty (60) days, itis agreed that the  
Company will post such jobs and employees within the  
department may bid to fill such temporary vacancies, it  
being understood that when the employees whose

work either before or after the sixty (60) day period,  
those employees who have been temporarily trans-  
ferred under the provisions provided herein will be  
returned to their respective jobs.  
it is understood that the temporary transfer policy is to

40  
Step 1 above, the grievance shall be reduced to writing,  
signed by the employee or employees involved and the  
Steward, specifying the provision in the Agreement  
claimed to be violated, and present it to the appropriate  
management representative and/or Department Man-  
ager within five (5) scheduled working days following

sentative in Step 1 above. The appropriate manage-  
ment representative and/or Department Manager will

Step 3: {f the matter is not satisfactorily settled in  
Step 2 above, the Shop Steward and employee shall  
submit such grievance within three (3) working days of  
the Company's answer in Step 2 to the Union's Busi-  
ness Agent. If the Union Business Agent determines  
that the matter has not been satisfactorily adjusted in  
keeping with the provisions of the Contract, then the  
Business Agent may take the matter up with the Human  
Resources Manager and/or his designated representa-  
tive within ten (10) days after the date of the Company's  
answer in Step 2 above. The Human Resources Man-  
ager and/or his designated representative shall give his  
answer in writing within five (5) days after such presen-  
tation of the matter to him.

41  
above. The Union Susiness Agent and the Plant Man-  
ager and/or his designated representative and the  
Director of Human Resources and/or his designated  
representative will attempt to work out a solution to the  
grievance. The Plant Manager or his designated repre-  
sentative will give an answer in writing within seven (7)  
days after the presentation of such grievance to him. {f  
the matter is not resolved at Step 4, the Union may  
submit the matter to arbitration as hereinafter provided.  
Section 2.  
Upon the request of the Union in writing, not later than  
thirty (30) days after the Company's answer in Step 4,  
the matter shall be referred to arbitration if it is subject  
to arbitration under the terms of this agreement.  
The following procedure shail be used:  
Ifthe Company and the Union cannot agree on a person  
to act as arbitrator within ten (10) days from the date of  
the Union's request as provided above for arbitration,  
they shall request the Federal Mediation and Concilia-  
tion Service to furnish a list of seven (7) qualified  
arbitrators. If the parties cannot agree on one of such  
seven (7) arbitrators to act as the impartial arbitrator,  
then such impartial arbitrator will be selected by the  
process of alternate marks. The parties shall determine  
by toss of a coin who shall have the first mark.  
Itis understood and agreed between the parties that the  
powers of the arbitrator are limited as follows:  
A. The arbitrator shall have no power to decide any  
matter which is declared not to be arbitrable by the  
42  
Union and the Company.  
B. The arbitrator shall be confined, in the decision to be  
rendered, to the meaning and interpretation of the  
particular provision of the Contract which gives rise to  
the dispute and to the issue submitted by the parties. He  
shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify  
this Agreement.  
C. The expenses of the arbitrator shall be paid by the  
losing party. In the case of a split decision fees shall be  
shared equally by the parties. The arbitrator shall  
render his decision in writing within one (1) month  
following the submission of the matter to him.  
D. Where time limits are mentioned in the grievance  
and arbitration procedures set forth herein, such time  
limits shall be applicable both to the Union and the  
Company. Each grievance shall be handled as a sepa-  
rate case unless several grievances grow out of the  
same incident or circumstances or they relate to the  
same matter, unless mutually agreed otherwise.  
If any of the time limits specified hereinabove are not  
followed, the grievance shall be deemed to have been  
abandoned at the expiration of the time period and  
neither party shall be required to proceed further with  
said grievance.  
Section 3.  
A mutual of a grievance pursuant to the  
procedures as set forth herein at any Step of the  
grievance procedure and/or a decision of the arbitrator  
will be final and binding upon all parties and the employ-  
43  
ees involved.  
Section 4.  
If in the process of handling a grievance the Company  
relies on time sheets, pay records, or other Company  
records pertaining to an individual grievance as a  
defense to the grievance or in justification of the  
Company’s action, then the records so relied upon will  
be made available to the Union for examination and  
inspection.  
Section 5.  
The time limits provided in the grievance and arbitration  
sections may be extended by mutual agreement, in  
writing, between the Company and the Union.  

### ARTICLE 7  
### DISCHARGE AND DISCIPLINE  
### 
Section 1.  
A. The Company shall have the right to discipline or  
discharge employees for just cause. The Company will  
give at least two (2) prior written warnings to an em-  
ployee of the complaint against him prior to discharge  
except in cases of mixed yarn in basic forming where  
only one prior written warning has to be given. No prior  
warnings need be given to employee before discharge  
if the cause of the discharge is for dishonesty, theft of  
Company property or the property of other employees,  
drinking or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs  
while on duty, immoral or indecent behavior, willful  
destruction of Company property or the property of  
other employees, gambling while on duty, fighting on  
Company premises, willful insubordination, willful falsi-  
44  
fication of employment, work or production records, and  
other serious offense. Written warning given to employ-  
as provided herein shall have effect for a period of  
twelve (12) months from the date of issuance. Upon the  
discharge of an employee as provided herein the Com-  
pany will promptly give written notice to the employee  
with a copy to the Union stating the reason for the  
discharge.  
B. Should an investigation prove that an injustice has  
been done an employee, he shall be reinstated. The  
terms and conditions of such reinstatement may pro-  
vide for full, partiat or no compensation for time lost.  
C. Within five (5) days after notice of the reason for the  
discharge as provided herein the discharge may be  
taken up under the grievance procedure and it is  
understaad that it may be initiated at Step 3 of the  
grievance procedure.  
Section 2.  
Itts undérstaad and agreed that should an employee or  
the Union feel that a written warning given an employee  
as provided hereinabove was unwarranted or without  
good cause, the giving of such written warning by the  
Company may be referred to the grievance procedure  
but will be processed only through Step 2 of the  
grievance procedure. Grievances processed by em-  
ployees receiving a second written warning in which the  
next violation may lead to termination may be pro-  
cessed up to and including Step 4. This excludes  
written warnigns for attendance under Articie 8. If the  
employee or the Union is dissatisfied with the Company's  
answer at Step 2 or Step 4 of the grievance procedure  
45  
relating to such a written warning, the matter will not be  
taken to the next Step (Step 3 or Arbitration), but the  
written warning will continue with the express under-  
standing that at such time as the written warning forms  
a basis of disciplinary action or discharge or otherwise  
ig used by the Company as a basis for adversely  
affecting the employee's wages, hours or other condi-  
tions of employment, then such warning may be grieved  
through the entire grievance and arbitration procedure.  
Copies of all written warnings shall be submitted to the  
Local Union.  
Section 3.  
Should the matter relating to the discharge of an em-  
ployee be submitted to arbitration, the question of  
whether the employee committed the offense for which  
he was discharged will be before the parties. If it is  
determined that the employee did not commit the  
offense then he will be made whole; however, if it is  
established that the employee actually committed the  
offense, then the discipline in such case will be limited  
to that which was proposed by the Company during the  
grievance procedure prior to arbitration unless it is  
proven that the discipline imposed was inconsistent  
with that imposed on other employees for similar of-  
fenses under similar circumstances since the effective  
date of this Contract.  

### ARTICLE 8  
### ATTENDANCE AND REPORTING OFF  
### 
Section 1.  
All employees are expected to work regularly. In order  
to maintain a consistent and fair yardstick by which to  
46  
   
measure the attendance and absentee records of all  
employees and by which to identify those employees  
whose chronic absences not only interfere with produc-  
tion and efficiency requirements of the Company but  
the work of other employees as well, the following policy  
will be employed.  
A. Acomplete record of all absences of an employee  
during an anniversary year will be noted on an atten-  
dance record by the appropriate management repre-  
sentative which will be available for inspection by the  
employee.  
B. For the purpose of this policy, an anniversary year  
is a year from the anniversary of an employee's plant  
seniority date through the day before his anniversary  
the following year. An "absence” means the occurrence  
of an absence whether it be for one day, more than one  
day. And a reported absence means an absence for  
which an employee has properly reported off prior to the  
start of his scheduled shift. From this standpoint and  
within the meaning of this policy, absences on consecu-  
tive work days will be counted as one absence.  
C. Times missed from work by reason of jury duty,  
military service, on-the-job injuries for which the em-  
ployee is entitled to draw Workmen's Compensation,  
vacations, funeral leave, excused time off for official  
Union business as outlined in Article 9, Section 5, or  
leaves of absence beyond two (2) working days of  
compelling and emergency personal reasons, illness,  
disability, accident or pregnancy when approved as  
provided for in Section 1, Article 9, do not constitute an  
absence for purposes of this policy.  
AT  
D. Anemployee as provided and defined herein, will be  
allowed eight (8) occurrences of absence in the period  
of an anniversary year. After an employee has four (4)  
reported absences, the appropriate Management Rep-  
resentative will review with the employee his atten-  
dance record for the anniversary year and the policy  
provided herein for discipline of excessive absentee-  
ism, and the employee will be given written notice with  
a copy to the Union after four (4) call-offs. if the  
employee feels the absentees are unjustified, he can at  
that time grieve the recorded absentees under the  
grievance procedure. If the employee does not grieve  
the four (4) absentees, at that time, the absentees will  
stand as recorded and will not be changed at a later date  
for consolidation or any other reason. After an em-  
ployee has had seven (7) reported absences in an  
anniversary year, the employee will again be inter-  
viewed by his appropriate Management Representa-  
tive, his attendance record and this policy will again be  
reviewed and the employee will be given written notice  
with a copy to the union that two (2) more absences in  
the same anniversary year will result in his discharge.  
If the employee feels the fifth through the seventh  
absentees are unjustified, he can at that time grieve the  
recorded absentees under the grievance procedure. If  
the employee does not grieve the absentees at that  
time, the absentees will stand as recorded and will not  
be changed at a later date for consolidation of any  
reason. Employees, in this manner, who occasion nine  
(9) reported absences in an anniversary year will be  
discharged.  
In the event an employee receives two (2) written  
warnings for absenteeism in two (2) consecutive anni-  
48  
versary years, followed by one (1) written warning for  
absenteeism in the next (current) anniversary year, the  
employee will be given written warning placing him on  
an Attendance Improvement Program (AIP) stating that  
three (3) occurrences of absence during the nexttwelve -  
(12) months will result in his discharge. Any furloughs or  
leaves of absence during this period will extend the  
twelve (12) month warning period by the equivalent  
number of calendar days away from work.  
E. Absences on consecutive days which do not involve  
non-occupational or occupational accidents, sickness  
or personal hardship, will count as separate absences.  
Absences on consecutive days caused by non-occupa-  
tional or occupational accidents, sickness or personal  
hardship will count as one absence.  
Employees who report off from work for more than two  
days for the same illness or personal hardship, each  
day thereafter will be counted as a separate occurrence  
of absence.  
The Company recognizes that a limited number of  
employees may require consideration for a defined  
penod of time beyond the normal contractual pravisions  
regarding absences due to serious medical problems or  
personal hardships.  
It is the Company’s and the Union's intention to address  
these kinds of problems by reviewing the employees  
request for consideration in conjunction with the  
employee's past attendance record to determine whether  
or not future absences related to the above will be  
counted as occurrences. In making this decision the  
49  
Company may ask the employee for additional informa-  
tion of documentation to support the employee's re-  
quest for consideration, including reporis from  
the personal physician. in addition the  
Company may require additional physical examina-  
tians and medical opinions.  
lt is also recognized that ar employee approved under  
this proviston that coniinues to have problems may  
result in the Company taking on of the following  
1} Place on layoff status, 2) Place on medica! Jeave of  
absence, or 3) Place on personal! of absence.  
Employees will be required to update such requests on  
@ periodic basis depending on the circumstances or at  
least every twelve (12) manths.  
F. Employees who have accumulated non-consecu-  
tive absences and have been discharged upon their  
ninth (9) absence wilt not be allowed to combine such  
absence with a back-dated Doctor's statement.  
G. Employees whose absences necessitate forced  
overtime or early call-ins on a continuing basis may be  
transferred to another shift, within the same job classi-  
fication, by the Company, in order to reduce the hard-  
ship imposed on other employees. Such transfer will be  
by mutual agreement by the Company and the Union.  
When such employee absences are corrected and do  
not put hardships on fellow employees, the Company  
will move such employee back to his regular shift.  
H. inthe event that snow and/or ice would prevent fifty-  
one percent (51%) of the employees on any shift from  
50  
  
reporting to work, the absence or consecutive ab-  
sences will not be counted as a recorded absence.  
Section 2.  
Any employee unable to report at his regularly sched-  
uled work time is required to report off. This notification  
will be made no later than one (1) hour prior to his  
scheduled reporting time.  
A. When reporting off, an employee will call 649-9911  
and give the following information.  
Name  
Clock Number  
Department  
Time scheduled to work  
Reason for reporting off  
When expected to return to work  
oO & WN os  
B. An unreported absence is defined as an absence  
when the employee fails to report off, as outlined above,  
one hour prior to the start of his scheduled shift, unless  
there is justifiable reason for failure to give such notice.  
In case of unreported absences, an employee will  
receive a verbal warning for the first offense and a  
written warning for the second offense with notice that  
a third offense, within his anniversary year, will result in  
discharge. On the third offense, within his same anni-  
versary year, the employee will be discharged.  
C. An employee will be allowed to work if he reports to  
work within thirty (30) minutes of the start of the shift  
provided no one has been held over at the overtime rate  
to fill his job classification.  
51  
Section 3.  
lf an employee is absent for three (3) consecutive  
workdays without reporting off unless there is justifiable  
reason for failure to report off he will be considered as  
having quit without notice and such em-  
ployee will be terminated.  
Section 4.  
An employee that leaves early four (4) times in an  
anniversary year may have his record reviewed by  
appropriate management representative and the Union  
Steward. The employee will be counseled for leaving  
early and written notice of this review will be given to the  
employee and to the Union. After this review, employ-  
ees may be given a written warning for each additional  
occurrence of leaving early under Article 7 of the  
Contract. Three (3) written warnings will result in dis-  
charge. Such counseling will remain in effect even  
though the employee's anniversary year has turned  
over, until the problem is corrected. This section will be  
applied the same for late's.  
The Company and Union agree that the intent and  
purpose of this provision will be applied the same as the  
Letter of Intent that has been under the past Contract  
Agreement.  
Section 5.  
The Company willreview employees’ attendance records  
to insure that the intent of the medical leave benefit is  
being utilized properly. If it is determined by the Com-  
pany that an employee is abusing this benefit, the  
employee will be counseled and notified that each  
additional leave will count as an.occurrence of absence.  
52  
This provision will be in effect for the remainder of that  
anniversary year and continuing until the end of the  
following anniversary year. This notice will be given in  
writing and a copy will be given to the Union.  

### ARTICLE 9  
### LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
### 
Section 1.  
Leaves of absence without loss of seniority rights may  
be granted by the Company upon request subject to the  
following conditions, limitations and procedures:  
A. Absences expected to iast for a period of two (2)  
working days or less do not require an employee to  
request in writing a leave of absence, but oral permis-  
sion may be granted for such short absences for  
sufficient cause by the appropriate management repre-  
sentative. The granting of any leave is not automatic  
and is subject to the following restrictions:  
1, The appropriate management representative may  
give oral permission, if the employee shows sufficient  
cause, for leave of absences not to exceed two  
days. The leave will be counted as one (1) absence.  
2. Incases where prior approval has not been obtained  
from the appropriate management representative for  
absences more than one (1) day, but less than two (2)  
days, an employee may call the guard giving the  
information required for reporting off. cases, the  
employee must give a phone number where he may be  
reached within the next 24 hour period. The appropriate  
management representative, at his option, may call the  
53  
employee to verify the information and may or may not  
grant the extended absence. In such cases, the em-  
ployee does not have to call off on a daily basis for the  
length of the granted leave.  
3. At the completion date of the leave, the employee  
must:  
a, Report back to work, or  
b. Report to Human Resources and receive a writ-  
ten leave of absence on the proper forms, or  
c. Call off each day if the original leave is for less  
than two (2) days and the employee wishes to extend it  
one additional day. If the extension is for the same  
reasons, it will count as one absence. !f the call-offis for  
another reason, it will be counted as another absence.  
Request for leaves of absence of more than two (2)  
working days shall be in writing on a form provided by  
the company and shall not be effective unti! and unless  
approved by the company. When approved, a copy of  
the approval will be given to the employee and the  
union,  
4, who desires to return to work prior to  
the date specified for expiration of his short-term ab-  
sence may do so by giving the company eight (8) hour  
notice prior to the time he wishes to return to work.  
B. Leaves of absence for compelling and emergency  
personal reasons, other than illness, disability or acci-  
dent, may be granted to an employee upon written  
request for an initial period not exceeding two (2)  
54  
calendar months; provided, that if the reason for such  
leave of absence continues for longer than two (2)  
calendar months, prior to the expiration of the initial  
leave of absence, the employee may apply and the  
Company may grant extensions of said leave of ab-  
sence not to exceed one (1) calendar month for each  
extension up to a total of not exceeding twelve (12)  
consecutive months. The Company may require a  
medical examination establishing the fact that the em-  
ployee is able to resume his regular job. Such examina-  
tion, if requested, will be at the Company's expense.  
C. Requests for leaves of absence due to illness,  
disability, or a non-occupational or occupational acci-  
dent shall be in writing and will be granted for a period  
of up to two (2) calendar months upon the proper proof  
of necessity therefore, with the right of the employee to  
receive renewals for one (1) calendar month period;  
provided said renewals are requested prior to the  
expiration of the leave of absence or any renewal  
thereof up to a total of not exceeding twelve (12)  
consecutive months for any illness, disability, or non-  
occupational accident. Any such request for leave of  
absence or any request for extension of such leave of  
absence shall, if requested by the Company, be accom-  
panied by an appropriate doctor's statement certifying  
the necessity for the leave or the extension and speci-  
fying the physical condition which necessitates it. The  
Company may require a medical examination or a  
special doctor's report establishing recovery from the  
illness, disability, or accident to the effect that he  
employee is fully able to resume his reguiar job without  
risk to the employee or other employees before permit-  
ting any employee who has been absent as a result of  
99  
a leave under this Section to resume his job. Such  
examination, if requested, will be at the Company's  
expense.  
D. Leaves of absences for occupational injuries cov-  
ered by Workman's Compensation will remain in effect  
for the maximum compensation period provided by law  
or untiisuch emptoyee is able to return to his normal job,  
whichever occurs sooner, Sections 1 (B) and  
(C) above provide for leaves of absence for reasons as  
outlined therein for a period not exceeding one (1) year.  
itis agreed by the parties that the normal situation which  
would require a leave of absence with not exist for longer  
than the one (1) year maximum period, provided for in  
these Sections, but it is understood that there could be  
that exceptional situation where the employee will not  
be able to return to work at the end of twelve (12)  
calendar months but would be able to return in the  
immediate foreseeable future. It is therefore, agreed  
that if an employee is on leave of absence under the  
provisions of Section 71 (B) and (C) above and is unable  
to return at the end of the maximum twelve (12) month  
period that the Company may review his case upon  
request of the employee and if it appears that the  
employee will be able to return to work in the immediate  
foreseeable future, the Company may extend the leave  
under those special circumstances beyond the one {1)  
year maximum limitation provided for above,  
£. A medical leave of absence starts the day an  
employee requests the Jeave by phone or in writing. If  
an employee can furnish a proper medical statement  
verifying the absences immediately preceding the leave  
of absence were related, the leave of absence will be  
56  
retroactive to the date of the initial preceding absence.  
If no medical proof is presented, the medical leave of  
absence will start the day the employee requested the  
leave.  
F. Leave of absence forms, for leaves extending be-  
yond two (2) days, may be obtained by the employee,  
a member of his family, or a friend.  
Section 2.  
Any employee who fails to return on the day specified  
as the expiration date of his leave of absence or the  
expiration date of an extension granted under this  
Article shall be deemed to have quit and shail have no  
further rights under this Agreement. Unless there is  
justifiable reason for failure to report.  
Section 3.  
No employee shall work elsewhere while on leave of  
absence from this Company unless express permis-  
sion to perform such outside work shall have been  
granted by the Human Resources Manager in writing.  
Any person who is on sick or other leave and found to  
be working elsewhere without such written permission  
shall be automatically separated from the employment  
of the Company. This shall not apply to employees on  
layoff.  
Section 4.  
An employee who desires to return to work prior to the  
date specified for the expiration of his leave of absence  
may only do so by giving the Company a week’s notice  
prior to the time he wishes to return to work. !f the  
Company can reasonably do so, it will allow him to  
57  
return to work prior to the end of the week's notice, but  
Shall have no obligation to do so until the end of the  
week's notice.  
Section 5.  
Leaves of absence when requested in writing forty-  
eight (48) hours in advance will be granted to employ-  
ees by the Union to attend a Union conven-  
tion or meeting. The total time for which such leaves will  
be granted will not exceed a cumulative total of fifteen  
(15) days for any one person in any calendar year. The  
Union agrees that, in making its requests for time off as  
provided in this Section, due consideration shall be  
given to the number of employees granted time off in  
order that there shalt be no disruption of tne Company's  
operations due to lack of available employees.  
Section 6.  
Upon written request to the Company, an employee will  
be granted a leave of absence from the bargaining unit  
far the purpose of accepting full ttme employment with  
the Local Union. Likewise, an employee wilt be granted  
a leave of absence from the bargaining unit to accept a  
non-bargaining unit position at the Aiken plant.  
Effective with the 1999 contract, employees accepting  
full time emptoyment with the Local or to serve in a  
management position al ihe Aiken plant will continue to  
accumulate plant and department seniority while on  
leave of absence from the bargaining unit.  
If such employee, while still in the employment of the  
Aiken plant or Locai Union returns to the bargaining  
unit, he will be placed on he highest rated job for which  
58  
he was Q-rated and to which his seniority entitles himto  
hold.  
Section 7.  
Employees returning fram leaves of absence will be  
able to return to their same shift and job classification.  
They will be allowed to replace the junior employee in  
the job classification provided they notify the Company  
five days prior to the expiration of their leave and  
provided they have the department seniority to displace  
such persons.  
Effective with the 1999 contract. employees that were  
on leave of absence for union business of to  
management position at the Aiken plant and returning  
from leave of absence will be able to return to his same  
shift and job classification and/or the area and position  
in which he held as long as such position exists.  

### ARTICLE 10  
### LUNCH and RELIEF  
### 
Section 1.  
All employees schedule to work a regular shift will be  
allowed a thirty (30) minute junch period. Where the  
Company schedules operations on a twenty-four (24)  
hour, three (3) shift basis, the Company will grant the  
employees working on such twenty-four (24) hour,  
three (3) shift basis their lunch period with pay. (But not  
to be schedule in the first two hours and thirty minutes
