all efforts to verbally contact a Management representative have been reasonably  
exhausted by the Employee.

reasons are justified to the Supervisor. Justifiable reasons are events which are beyond

performance will be accomplished in accordance with the Agency's performance  
appraisal system.  
3. The purpose of the discipline and adverse action program is to maintain control and  
order within the workforce by requiring compliance with established rules and  
regulations. Disciplinary actions will normally be taken using the concept of progressive  
discipline. While the concept of progressive discipline is the general rule, there may be  
times or circumstances when the Technician's behavior is such that a more severe  
punishment is required for the first offense. Supervisors will proactively address  
unacceptable behavior at the earliest and lowest level of discipline possible. However,  
this does not inhibit Management's right to choose a higher of discipline as  
appropriate.

regulations.

actions will be administered in a fair, impartial, and timely manner in accordance with

unreasonably delayed. Some examples of a reasonable delay may include pending  
investigations or unexpected work schedule conflicts of short duration. Management  
agrees that in order for the discipline to be effective it must be timely.  
7. In those situations where an original decision may be delayed, the Employee and/or  
their representative (if known) will be notified stating the reason for the delay and the  
anticipated decision date.

section prior to being issued to the Employee.  
Section 13.2 - Douglas Factors  
1. In determining the appropriate remedy, penalty, or punishment, Management will  
observe the principles of "like penalties for like offenses in like circumstance" as  
outlined in the "Douglas Factors".  
2. Management must ensure that when an Employee's past disciplinary record is  
Agreement Between the Adjutant General of Michigan and the Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) 45  
September 2015  
referenced said reference should be a past action (in effect) at the time the most recent  
conduct occurred. Otherwise, consideration is improper and cannot be relied upon.  
3. Letters of reprimand that have expired may be used as a consideration when  
determining the penalty to be imposed in an adverse action when a range of penalties  
may be imposed. However, the expired LOR may not be used to constitute a prior  
offense.  
Section 13.3 - Investigation, Examination and Representation  
1. When a bargaining unit Employee is questioned by an Employer representative in  
conjunction with an investigation, the individual overseeing the questioning will be  
required to inform the Employee of his/her right to Union representation (Weingarten

investigation being conducted by the Michigan National Guard.

questioning, you have the right to not answer any questions until a Union  
representative is present.  
You also have the right to be advised of the subject and purpose of this  
interview and to consult in private with your Union representative prior to  
answering any questions.  
Do you understand these rights as I've explained them to you: Yes or No?  
Do you want to exercise your right to have a Union representative present  
during questioning: Yes or No?  
2. Management officials inform Employees of their Weingarten Right to representation  
prior to any examination held for the purpose of discipline if:  
a. There is, or could be, a reasonable expectation by either the Employee or the  
Supervisor that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the Employee.  
b. The Employee requests representation.  
c. When questioned, Employees are compelled to provide truthful responses to  
questions raised during an investigation. Employees cannot refuse to answer questions,  
but if an Employee desires representation, it shall be granted before the examination  
can be continued.

duties and responsibilities of the current PD accurately reflect the work being performed  
by the Employee. Supervisors will review the PD with the Employee on an annual  
basis, usually in conjunction with their performance appraisal, or as requested by the  
Employee. New-hire Employee’s will be provided a current copy of their PD at their  
incoming briefing.

to a PD will be provided to the affected Employee(s). When a PD is changed, the

position is not classified correctly may request a classification appeal.

perform “other duties as assigned”.  
2. "Other duties as assigned" does not apply to tasks which would otherwise be  
considered as additionai duties, details, temporary promotion, or a reassignment, and  
may not include those duties that might result in injury to the Employee or fellow  
due to a lack of knowledge of, or training for, the task.

assigned." If an Employee is assigned duties of a higher pay grade for a temporary  
duration, temporary promotion procedures may be used IAW the State Merit Placement  
procedures.
