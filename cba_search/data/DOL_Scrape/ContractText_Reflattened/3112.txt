Superintendent shall state in writing the reasons for rejection in his/her response. In the event of a disagreement  
on the issue of any specific job description/position title, PERC shall be petitioned for a ruling on the inclusion  
or exclusion of the position. Any person placed in a contested position shall upon a ruling by PERC for  
inclusion or exclusion in the bargaining unit receive all rights granted under this Agreement from the time of  
initial placement.

### ARTICLE V--SENIORITY  
### SECTION A  
### 
1. Seniority shall be the length of continuous service of an SRP in the school system. Continuous service shall  
be determined in reference to unbroken service in the district with each year in which an SRP has been in a  
paid duty status for at least (1) day more than one-half (1/2) of the normal work year for the position counted  
as one (1) year of service. If an SRP takes ten (10) or more successive days of unpaid leave, these days shall  
be deducted from the normal work year, and if this deduction reduces the normal year to less than one (1) day  
more than one-half (1/2) the normal work year for the position, the year shall not be counted.  
2. Seniority shall be one of the factors considered when making work assignments, when assigning overtime,  
and when decreasing hours within an area of assignment at a worksite. However, at an alternative school for  
disruptive students, cost effectiveness and efficiency and the needs of students shall be among the factors  
considered when making work assignments. In instances in which work assignments can be made in which  
students’ needs are met and cost effectiveness and efficiency are not adversely affected, seniority shall be  
considered in making the work assignments.  
3. If it becomes necessary to establish precedence among SRP with the same seniority, the beginning date of  
continuous service shall be used. Leave duly authorized and granted in accordance with provisions of this  
Agreement shall not constitute a break in service.  
SECTION B  
The first week of each month, the Board shall provide seniority data to the Union. The data will contain job  
classification of the names of all SRP employed in the district and total number of years of continuous service in  
the district as determined by the District School Board of Pasco County. Seniority lists may be posted on the  
Union bulletin board at each worksite. The Union shall provide the district with a computer and a peripheral  
storage device to transmit the data.

Florida Division of Administrative Hearings pursuant to the Florida Administrative Procedure Act.  
SECTION B - POSITION VACANCIES

### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
### 
4.  
It is the Board's intention that the best-qualified applicant be hired for each vacant position. The Board  
agrees to give full consideration to the professional background and attainments of applicants for vacancies.  
If the SRP is qualified for said position, he/she shall be interviewed by the appropriate supervisor.  
Applicants shall be notified in writing of the decision by the worksite supervisor.  
SECTION D - LAYOFF PROCEDURE  
1.  
Layoff is defined as the reduction in force for lack of funds or changes in allocation without fault on the part  
of any employee. Layoffs may occur due to staff reduction at a worksite or the closing of an existing facility.  
The Board shall notify the Union immediately upon determination that layoffs must occur.  
. In case of staff reduction at a worksite, volunteers for layoff will first be sought from among the affected  
SRP. In the event the number of volunteers is not sufficient, the SRP with the least seniority in the district  
among those assigned to the worksite at which the reduction must occur within the area of assignment  
affected shall be laid off first. "Area of assignment" shall mean specific job title. Should it become  
necessary to reduce the number of Bus Driver/Paraprofessionals at an alternative school for disruptive  
students, the school principal after receiving recommendations from the staff relative to program needs and  
needs of students, will determine the SRP to be laid off. SRP selected for layoff and the Union shall be given  
notice of the layoff and the reason therefore in writing.  
If a school has at least fifteen (15) students speaking the same home language and a Paraprofessional  
(ESOL/Bilingual) is the only Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) on staff who is  
proficient in the same home language, then to comply with Florida State Board of Education Rules, Chapter  
6A-6.0904 (4) (c), the seniority requirement contained in paragraph 2 above relative to the layoff of a  
Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) will be preempted.  
An SRP who is laid off under provisions of this section shall be placed on leave without pay for a period of  
twelve (12) months. This leave may not be extended beyond one (1) year for any reason.  
An SRP who is laid off under provisions of this section shall retain his/her seniority upon recall. Layoff shall  
not be considered a break in service if the SRP is recalled under the Recall Procedure, Article VII, Section E.  
An SRP who is placed on leave because of layoff shall have the right to unemployment compensation, and  
nothing contained herein shall be construed to abridge that right.  
SECTION E - RECALL PROCEDURE  
1.  
2.  
Laid off SRP shall be recalled to their job classification in inverse order of layoff.  
Recall lists by job title shall be maintained districtwide and positions shall be offered regardless of where  
they occur in the district, except that no school or department shall be required to fill more than fifty percent  
(50%) of its vacant positions by job title from recall lists unless no other vacant positions are available within  
the district. At an alternative school for disruptive students, the principal, after interviewing an employee on  
a recall list in which the school has a vacancy, may decline to hire the employee. An employee on a Bus  
Driver/Paraprofessional recall list will be granted preference in hiring over outside applicants for district  
positions for which he/she possesses required qualifications provided that no recall lists exist for these  
positions and there are no laws or regulations which would bar this procedure. A Bus  
Driver/Paraprofessional who wishes to claim this preference must notify the worksite supervisor and the  
District Human Resources Office in writing of his/her intentions at the time of application for an advertised  
vacancy. Failure to make this notification will bar relief through the grievance process in the event  
preference is not granted. The Union shall be notified of all SRP on the recall list, in order of recall. This list  
shall be updated whenever there is a change in the SRP sequential recall order.  
It shall be the responsibility of each laid off SRP to provide the Board with a telephone number and mailing  
address at which he/she can be reached or at which a message may be left during working hours. Telephone  
calls for the purpose of recalling SRP shall be made Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. when the  
district office is in normal operation, based on the twelve (12) month work calendar. The Union shall be  
provided with a copy of this calendar.  
Before the recall procedure is initiated, the Union shall be notified that a position is being offered to a  
specifically named SRP. When a vacancy occurs in a position for which a recall list exists, the Board shall  
attempt to contact the person at the top of the list by telephone at least three (3) times per day over a three (3)  
day period and offer the position to the SRP. A busy signal shall not count as an attempt to reach the SRP.  
In the event an SRP's telephone is out of order due to no fault of said SRP, the SRP shall be returned to the  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 9  

### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
### 
10.  
top of the recall list upon confirmation of this situation. In the event a person cannot be reached after these  
attempts, he/she shall be placed at the bottom of the list and notified of this action by certified mail. In the  
event a person cannot be reached after following this procedure two (2) additional times, the Board shall be  
released from further recall obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons  
from the employment of the Board.  
If a school has at least fifteen (15) students speaking the same home language and there is no  
Paraprofessional or Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) on staff who is proficient in the same home  
language, then to comply with Florida State Board of Education Rules, Chapter 6A-6.0904 (4) (c), the  
seniority requirement contained in paragraph 1 above relative to the recall of a Paraprofessional or  
Instructional Assistant (ESOL/Bilingual) will be preempted.  
The person at the top of the recall list for a specific position vacancy must respond within forty-eight (48)  
hours of an offer of a position. If the person does not accept that position, he/she shall be placed at the  
bottom of the recall list. If the SRP declines the second position offered by the Board, except as provided in  
Article VII, Section E, paragraph 7, the Board shall be released from further recall obligations, and the  
person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of the Board. It shall be  
the obligation of the notified SRP, except in an emergency, to respond to a job offer made under the  
provisions of this section. Non-response without cause shall be deemed to be a resignation for personal  
reasons.  
When an SRP is offered a position at a worksite which is twenty (20) miles further from the SRP's previous  
worksite, he/she shall have the right to turn down two (2) such offers before being placed at the bottom of the  
recall list. When said SRP reaches the top of the recall list again, the Board shall offer him/her the next  
available position. If the SRP declines this position, the Board shall be released from further recall  
obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of  
the Board.  
When an SRP who is a tobacco user and who is on the recall list is offered a position at a smoke and tobacco  
free site, he/she shall have the right to turn down the position and shall retain his/her current place on the  
recall list. If the SRP who is a tobacco user turns down a position at a smoke and tobacco free site and gives  
being a tobacco user as the reason for turning down the position, he/she shall retain his/her current position  
on the recall list but will no longer be offered positions at other smoke and tobacco free sites.  
If, after accepting a position, an SRP does not report to the new position within five (5) working days of the  
offer being made, the Board shall be released from further recall obligations, and the person shall be deemed  
to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of the Board.  
If an SRP has not been recalled within twelve (12) months of layoff, the Board shall have no further recall  
obligations, and the person shall be deemed to have resigned for personal reasons from the employment of  
the Board.  
SECTION F - EVALUATION  
1.  
Prior to September 15, all SRP shall receive a copy of the assessment instrument, and an explanation of the  
assessment process shall be provided. In the event an SRP is employed after other SRP have received this  
information, said instrument and explanation shall be given upon employment.  
The worksite supervisor or designee making the evaluation shall meet with the SRP to discuss the areas in  
which the SRP's performance is satisfactory, and any area(s) in which the SRP's performance is unsatis-  
factory/deficient, or in which the SRP needs improvement.  
After each assessment of an SRP, the SRP or witness shall sign and be given a copy of the assessment  
instrument. The signature of the SRP shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the assessment but only  
acknowledges that he/she has read the report.  
An SRP shall be given the opportunity to include his/her comments in writing concerning the assessment  
report or, in the case of subparagraph 5 below, any written notification of performance deficiencies. These  
comments shall be placed in the SRP's personnel file if the assessment report or, in the case of subparagraph  
5 below, any written notification of performance deficiencies is placed in the SRP's personnel file.  
In the event an SRP is not performing satisfactorily, the worksite supervisor or designee shall advise the SRP  
in writing of the specific deficiencies in his/her performance and shall give the SRP reasonable time and  
assistance to overcome these deficiencies. The worksite supervisor or designee will:  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 10  

### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
### 
a) notify the SRP in writing that deficiencies exist,  
b) provide a full and complete explanation of deficiencies and suggested corrections,  
c) offer administrative and supervisory assistance, and  
d) provide reasonable time for correction of deficiencies.  
This written notification of performance deficiencies may be accompanied by a completed assessment  
instrument. However, at an alternative school for disruptive students, an SRP whose performance has not  
met the expectations of the principal shall be subject to involuntary transfer to another worksite twenty-five  
(25) days after the principal has provided the SRP with an opportunity to improve his/her performance and  
the performance continues to be below expectation. At any time during this period, beginning with the initial  
notification to the SRP that he/she may be subject to involuntary transfer, the Union has the right to represent  
the SRP. At an alternative school for disruptive students, the salary of an SRP who is involuntarily  
transferred to another worksite shall be no less than he/she would have earned at the alternative school for the  
remainder of the school year. SRP involuntarily transferred shall not be transferred to a worksite which is  
twenty (20) miles further from his/her residence than the alternative school for disruptive students.  
All confidentiality of the assessment allowable by law will be granted by the Administration.  
All SRP will be evaluated, through the use and completion of an approved assessment instrument, at least  
once during the school year. Should a worksite supervisor not meet the date designated by the Human  
Resources Department for the completion of an SRP’s evaluation, the worksite supervisor will inform the  
SRP of the reason for the delay. If an SRP receives an unsatisfactory evaluation, the SRP has the option of  
another evaluation to determine if satisfactory performance has been demonstrated. All evaluations shall be  
conducted only by worksite supervisors, their designees, or district-level supervisors.  
All recommendations regarding continued employment except for positions affected by the layoff procedure  
shall be based upon information contained in the SRP's personnel file.  
SECTION G - STAFF DEVELOPMENT  
1.  
By February 1, the worksite supervisor and the SRP building representative will jointly conduct an election  
of all bargaining unit members at that worksite to elect a representative to coordinate SRP staff development  
activities there. The employee receiving the highest number of votes will be selected as that worksite's SRP  
staff development coordinator. All bargaining unit members at that worksite and the Union will be advised  
of election results.  
The Board and the Union shall meet to assess the district’s staff development programs as they relate to SRP  
and to make recommendations for changes/improvements.  
All staff development components offered within any calendar month shall be posted in each worksite by the  
fifteenth (15th) working day prior to the activity.  
When appropriate, SRP may serve as instructors for staff development components. The total compensation  
paid to SRP serving as instructors shall be one and one-half (1 1/2) times their regular hourly rate of pay for  
each meeting hour taught and such SRP shall be paid for mileage necessary to perform his/her duties as  
instructor under this section. Such mileage payment shall be in accordance with Article XI, Section A,  
paragraph 3 of this Agreement.  
Attendance at staff development components shall be voluntary except for those components required to  
implement additional programs or goals established by the Board, the Legislature, or federal grants.  
SRP within a specific field shall have first opportunity to attend staff development components related to  
their field.  
Master inservice points may be used for recertification, and each group of twenty (20) points shall be  
equivalent to one (1) semester hour for this purpose.  
SECTION H - POLITICAL ACTIVITY  
   
1. All SRP shall have the freedom of political action when not engaged in their work assignments or other  
assigned responsibilities during the workday provided such action is within the laws of the United States of  
America and the State of Florida and their jobs are not used for their political advantage.  
2. The right of all SRP to work and to vote for the party and candidate of their choice shall never be questioned,  
abridged, or denied by either the Board or the Union.  
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 11  

### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
### 
3. All SRP shall be entirely free from political domination, coercion, or the pretended necessity of making  
political contributions of money or other things of value or engaging in any political work or activity against  
their wishes under the assumption that failure to do so will in any way affect their status as employees of the  
school system or as members of the Union.  
SECTION I - WORK DAY/WORK YEAR  
1. Each SRP shall be granted at least a thirty (30) minute duty-free non-paid lunch period. However, at an  
alternative school for disruptive students, the thirty (30) minute lunch period for Bus Driver/Paraprofes-  
sionals may not be duty-free and shall be included within their eight (8) hour workday. An SRP who does  
not receive a paid lunch period shall be permitted to leave the worksite during his/her lunch period.  
2. Paid Relief Periods/Breaks  
a) Paid relief/break periods are intended to provide relief from the work schedule so as to reduce employee  
fatigue and to allow SRP to attend to personal needs. As such, paid relief/break periods should not be  
taken at either the start or end of the workday. The worksite supervisor shall designate the relief period  
for each SRP.  
b) SRP who work six (6) to eight (8) hours a day shall be granted two (2) fifteen (15) minute relief periods  
during the workday, and SRP who work less than six (6) hours, but at least three (3) hours a day shall be

necessary, an SRP who is not an exempt employee within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act who  
works such overtime shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times his/her regular hourly rate for  
each hour in excess of forty (40) hours per week. With mutual agreement, compensatory time-off may be  
substituted for overtime pay provided such compensatory time can be granted prior to the end of the SRP’s  
workweek.

permit employment at the hours stated above, a custodian may be employed for fewer hours.  
5. Subject to the following conditions, a Bus Driver shall be guaranteed six (6) hours of work per day during the

b) the driver will be given the opportunity to work the difference in hours provided by his/her route and the  
guaranteed minimum hours by either (1) working additional daily driving assignments, (2) driving  
extracurricular trips, or (3) cleaning spare buses; in the event a driver is unwilling or unable to work the  
difference in hours, he/she will be paid for the time worked, not the time guaranteed;  
c) when there is an open route at or above the guaranteed minimum hours, if a driver currently driving a  
route that is shorter than the guaranteed minimum is offered the route and refuses it, he/she shall no  
longer be guaranteed minimum hours for that school year;  
d) route selection for the regular school year will occur seven (7) calendar days prior to the first student day.  
6. If workdays are authorized for food and nutrition service employees, the activities to be accomplished during

day during the regular work year:  
a) guarantee will be calculated on a biweekly pay period basis;  
b) the Transportation Assistant will be given the opportunity to work the difference in hours provided by  
his/her route and the guaranteed minimum hours by substituting on other runs or, if substitute work is not  
available, by working in assigned schools; in the event a Transportation Assistant is unwilling or unable  
to work the difference in hours, he/she will be paid for the time worked, not the time guaranteed;

11. HB 349 of the 1999 Florida Legislature, Florida Statute 1003.01 requires the district to provide 240 days of  
instruction for students in the district’s Juvenile Justice Programs. In order to provide these additional  
services to students in such programs, additional days must be provided for SRP beyond their regular

material by affixing his/her signature on the actual copy to be filed, with the understanding that such  
signature merely signifies that he/she had read the material to be filed and does not necessarily indicate  
agreement with the content. In the event an SRP shall refuse to sign, a witness may sign to indicate that the  
SRP has received the material.  
2. The SRP shall have the right to provide a written answer to any material in the SRP's file, and said answer

1.  
Smoking and the use of all tobacco products are prohibited by law inside all School Board facilities and in all  
“common areas” as defined in the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act to be “any hallway, corridor, lobby, aisle,  
water fountain area, restroom, stairwell, entryway, or conference room...”  
The current practice whereby the worksite administrator designates employee outdoor smoking area(s) that  
are shielded from student view and are located away from regularly used student activity areas on existing  
School Board grounds shall continue, except under the following conditions:  
a) Effective July 1, 1996, newly acquired worksites, including all School Board real and personal property  
located on those sites, shall be designated as smoke and tobacco free. No employee at these sites shall  
use any tobacco product in the building(s) or on any outside grounds. This includes the use of such  
tobacco products in motor vehicles, with the exception of those vehicles entering or exiting the  
worksite(s).  
b) A committee shall exist consisting of six (6) members, three (3) representing the Board and three (3)  
representing the Union, for the purpose of resolving problems that may arise due to the implementation of  
the Tobacco Free Policy.  
All employees assigned to any School Board facility which is not smoke and tobacco free shall be  
surveyed once each year if requested by any employee at the facility. Such request shall be made in  
writing by September 30 to the Director of Employee Relations, with a copy provided to the President of  
the Union. The intent of the survey is that, as all employees at any such facility declare that they are non-  
tobacco users or are willing to refrain from the use of tobacco products at the facility, the facility shall be  
declared tobacco free.  
When an SRP who is a tobacco user and who is on the recall list is offered a position at a smoke and tobacco  
free site, he/she shall have the right to turn down the position and shall retain his/her current place on the  
recall list. If the SRP who is a tobacco user turns down a position at a smoke and tobacco free site and gives  
C  
  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 15  

### ARTICLE VII -- WORKING CONDITIONS  
### 
being a tobacco user as the reason for turning down the position, he/she shall retain his/her current position  
on the recall list but will no longer be offered positions at other smoke and tobacco free sites.  
SECTION R - RELIEF BUS DRIVERS  
1. In an effort to provide an adequate number of Bus Drivers, the position of “Relief Bus Driver” has been  
established. It is the intent of the Board to fill vacancies in this position from within the ranks of Bus Drivers  
currently employed with the district and to use Relief Bus Drivers as described in the approved job  
description.  
a) Relief Bus Driver hourly rate will be based on a forty (40) hour week using the salary schedule for Bus  
Drivers (SRP 19). Overtime, if any, will be kept to a minimum. However, any Relief Bus Driver who is  
called to work shall be paid for a minimum of two (2) hours.  
Advertising for Relief Bus Driver positions will be conducted “in-house.” Should this not result in filling  
all available Relief Bus Driver positions, advertising will be conducted to attract applicants from outside  
of the Transportation Department.  
c) A regular Bus Driver who moves to a Relief Bus Driver position will retain seniority as a Bus Driver.  
Such seniority will be retained for purposes of layoff/recall, route bidding on an open position, and route  
selection if the Relief Bus Driver reenters the selection process prior to the start of the school year. A  
single seniority list will be kept for the group comprised of Bus Drivers and Relief Bus Drivers for these  
purposes.  
Relief Bus Drivers will be allowed to reenter the selection process prior to the start of the school year in  
order to bid for a regular route, according to the procedures as established in the SRP Master Contract,  
Article VIII, Section A, paragraph 10. A Relief Bus Driver who wishes to reenter the selection process in  
this manner must apply in writing to the Director of Transportation on or before May 15 preceding the  
start of a new school year.  
e) Relief Bus Drivers will be allowed to bid on open routes. However, the Relief Bus Driver may be  
required to remain in the Relief Bus Driver position until his/her replacement is hired.  
b  
  
d  
—  
f) Relief Bus Drivers will be afforded the same rights to bid on Summer School routes as are Bus Drivers.  
g) Relief Bus Drivers can choose to be in the field trip rotation. However, the Relief Bus Driver recognizes  
that because of the requirement to keep overtime to a minimum, the opportunity for field trip assignments  
is diminished.  
h) Relief Bus Drivers may be used as coaches or to assist in training of new drivers. Relief Bus Drivers will  
not be used in a supervisory capacity.  
2. The Board and the Union will work together to resolve problems, if any, as the problems become identified.  
SECTION S - SCHOOL ADVISORY COUNCILS  
1. The composition of and procedures for SRP, education support employees, membership on School Advisory

require twenty (20) or more hours in a normal working week.  
3. Upon the Union President's request, the Superintendent and/or his/her designee shall meet with the Union  
President on mutually agreeable date(s) and time(s) for the purpose of facilitating the communication of  
information regarding school accountability and improvement.  
SECTION T - MISCELLANEOUS  
1. The SRP are essential persons in the educational process and shall be treated with dignity and respect.  
a) Within the context of an appropriate setting, SRP shall be encouraged to provide input and suggestions in  
matters pertaining to their job duties.  
b) Insofar as SRP are involved in disciplinary matters concerning students, administrators shall support SRP  
in disciplinary matters in a manner consistent with the facts of each incident, the disciplinary record of the  
student involved, the provisions of the Code of Student Conduct, and any other factors which have a  
bearing on the matter under consideration.

perform the duties of a position shall be exempt from provisions of this section.  
No SRP shall be required to present evidence of health, including but not limited to health certificates and  
tuberculosis skin test results, as a condition of continued employment except as provided in Florida Statutes,

Upon request, an SRP shall receive a courtesy pass for regular season district athletic events which will admit  
him/her free of charge.  
The regular appointment date as a Transportation Assistant shall be used to determine the order for route

the school.  
At the end of their first year, SRP who volunteered to work at an alternative school for disruptive students  
shall have the right to return to their previous worksite position. If an SRP wishes to exercise this right,  
he/she must notify his/her current and previous worksite supervisors and the district Human Resources  
Department in writing of his/her intentions prior to April 1. Failure to make this notification will bar relief  
through the grievance process in the event another person has been appointed to the previous worksite  
position for the next school year.

service for any reason, but seniority shall not be accrued during that time except in the case of Military Leave  
or the Union President's leave.  
Any SRP on approved leave with pay shall be eligible for all benefits during the period of the leave including  
but not limited to retirement and retention of employment status.  
During any approved leave of absence, the SRP shall have the right to participate in all group fringe benefit  
plans provided by the Board. In the event the leave is unpaid, the SRP shall be permitted to make his/her  
own and the Board's regular contributions to all benefits requiring such contributions.  
Any SRP on approved, extended leave who returns to the position held prior to going on leave without a  
break in service shall be placed on the appropriate salary step upon return. If the SRP does not return to the  
position held prior to going on leave or if there is a break in service, salary step placement shall be governed  
by the rules in effect at the time of rehire. However, those SRP returning from Military Leave within the  
time legally stipulated shall be advanced to the appropriate position on the salary schedule as if they had been  
in actual service in the district.

8) Unpaid Personal Leave not to exceed nine (9) workdays for circumstances not covered by 1 through  
7. In cases of documented family problems, household emergencies, and/or legal business which  
necessitates the SRP being absent from work, an additional eleven (11) days of unpaid Personal Leave  
may be granted. The supporting reasons for such additional unpaid Personal Leave must be submitted  
in writing.  
b) Upon request, an SRP shall be granted any unpaid leave listed in Article VIII, Section C-Unpaid Leaves

leave and whose position is being held will be notified prior to employment that their appointment is only for  
the period of time that the SRP is on leave. In the event that the SRP does not return from leave or extends  
his/her leave and no longer qualifies for the position to be held, the person occupying the position shall  
continue in the position. Prior to recommending approval of an extended, unpaid leave, the worksite  
supervisor shall inform the SRP in writing whether or not his/her position will be held for the return of the  
SRP from leave. If the position will not be held, the SRP will be terminated at the end of his/her leave.  
However, an SRP will be given consideration for other positions for which he/she may be qualified when  
he/she is ready to return from leave.  
7. a) If an SRP has exhausted all paid leave and is still unable to work because of personal illness or injury,  
he/she will be granted unpaid Sick Leave for a period not to exceed twenty (20) additional workdays, and  
his/her position will be held. If the SRP is still unable to return to work at that point, he/she shall be  
granted Health Leave under the provisions contained in Article VIII, Section C-5. If the SRP is unable to  
return to work after the first ninety (90) days of Health Leave, his/her position will no longer be held.  
b) Unpaid leave granted under the provisions of Article VIII, Section C-7 a) 5), Family and Medical Leave  
(FMLA), based on the serious health condition of the SRP, will be counted toward the days available for  
unpaid Health Leave, and will be counted toward the ninety (90) days of Health Leave in which an SRP's  
position will be held.  
Should an SRP be granted FMLA Leave due to the SRP's serious health condition, and such leave be  
granted beyond the first ninety (90) days of unpaid Health Leave, the SRP's position will be held until the  
conclusion of his/her approved FMLA Leave. If the SRP is unable to return to work after the conclusion  
of the approved FMLA Leave, his/her position will not be held.  
8. An SRP who is absent without leave on a temporary basis shall not be subject to loss of pay and/or subject to  
reprimand or dismissal if said absence is beyond the individual's control and the SRP is unable to notify the  
worksite supervisor or designee and said SRP is eligible for paid leave during his/her absence. Upon request  
by the worksite supervisor or designee, reasonable documentation, if the situation permits, and/or explanation  
will be furnished by the SRP at the earliest possible time.

7. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)  
a) The Board will grant an eligible employee (as defined in subparagraph c) of this section up to a total of  
twelve (12) weeks of leave in a twelve (12) month period (July 1 through June 30, as defined in  
subparagraph b) of this section for one or more of the following reasons:

Part a) 5). For purposes of this paragraph: (a) the term "spouse" means a husband or wife as defined  
or recognized under State law for purposes of marriage; (b) the term "parent" means a biological  
parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a  
child — this term does not include parents "in law"; (c) the terms "son" or "daughter" mean a  
biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco  
parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental  
or physical disability.  
5) the treatment of a serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing his/her job.

overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility);  
b. any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities, of  
more than three (3) calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the  
supervision of) a health care provider; or  
c. continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or long-  
term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a  
period of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days; or for prenatal care.  
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not "serious health  
conditions" unless inpatient hospital care is required.

month period immediately preceding the unpaid leave. Holidays, earned Sick Leave, and vacation time  
for which the employee has been paid but has not worked shall be included in the calculation of the 1,250  
hours. Workers' Compensation, suspension with pay, and Sabbatical Leave for which the employee has  
been paid will not be included in the calculation of the 1,250 hours. Sick Leave Bank days for which the  
employee has been paid will not be included in the calculation of the 1,250 hours. Should an SRP apply  
for FMLA Leave based on the serious health condition of the SRP as described in subparagraph 7 a) 5),  
and such requested leave immediately follows Sick Leave Bank days which were granted for the SRP's  
serious health condition, the twelve (12) month period in which the SRP received pay will be calculated  
prior to the first day of approved Sick Leave Bank.

1) Anemployee must first use all available earned paid Sick Leave before unpaid FMLA Leave will be

3) The Board shall require materials documenting the reason for the leave before granting a leave of

4) It is the responsibility of the employee to obtain the necessary documentation and to furnish the  
documentation to the Board.  
5) The Board may request verification of a medical condition for which leave has been granted under  
this section at any reasonable interval, but not more often than once every thirty (30) days, unless:  
a. the employee requests an extension of leave;  
b. circumstances described by the original documentation have changed significantly (i.e., the  
duration of the illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or  
c. the employer receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the  
documentation.  
6) If the Board pays the employee contribution missed by the employee while on leave, the employee  
will be required to reimburse the Board for delinquent payments (on a payroll deduction schedule)  
upon return from leave. The employee will be required to sign a written statement at the beginning of  
the leave period authorizing the payroll deduction for delinquent payments.  
7) An employee may continue coverage by continuing to pay the employee's portion of the premiums,  
including dependent coverage, while on leave.  
8) The employee must notify the Board as soon as practicable once the employee knows that a leave will  
be needed. For a foreseeable leave, such as for birth, adoption, or planned medical treatment, the  
employee must provide at least thirty (30) days notice to the Board. In all cases, the employee must  
furnish a request to the Board on a form provided by the Board.  
9) Prior to the employee's return to work from an employee disability, the employee shall submit  
medical certification of the employee's fitness to return to work.

leaves of absence within the requirements of the FMLA. This includes but is not limited to requiring  
a second opinion, at the Board's discretion, from a Board-paid doctor with regard to a medical  
disability, and the use of forms for requests for leave, physician documentation, and fitness to return  
to work.  
11) In the event that the Board exercises its right to a second medical opinion and the opinion conflicts  
with the first doctor's opinion in the medical certification, then a third opinion may be required by a  
Board-paid physician mutually agreed upon by the Board and employee. This third opinion will be  
final and binding upon the Board and the employee.

### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
### 
j) Intermittent Leave or Reduced Leave  
An eligible employee who is entitled to a twelve (12) week leave under the provisions of this section may  
take that leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule in certain cases. An intermittent leave  
schedule is one in which the employee may take the allowable leave intermittently, or in blocks of days at  
a time, as needed. A reduced leave schedule is one in which the employee's daily or weekly work hours  
are reduced, as needed. Leave will be granted intermittently or on a reduced leave basis in the case of the  
serious health conditions of the employee or of the child, spouse, or parent of the employee, provided that  
it is medically necessary and that a certification from a physician is obtained.  
The amount of Family and Medical Leave used where an employee takes leave intermittently or on a  
reduced leave schedule will be determined in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Family  
and Medical Leave Act of 1993, currently 8825.205 of the Interim Regulations.  
Effect of Leave on Board-Paid Benefits  
During the period of leave governed by this section, the Board will pay the portion of the insurance  
premium which it normally paid prior to the leave, such as major medical, surgical, dental, vision, life,  
and flexible benefits. The cost of these benefits will be paid by the Board based on the expectation that  
the employee will return to work following the approved FMLA Leave. Return to work means that the  
employee must return to work for at least thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion of approved  
FMLA Leave or following the conclusion of other approved leave which is granted under Article VIII and  
which is immediately subsequent to the FMLA Leave. Non-contracted days during summer break, and  
unpaid holidays during winter and spring break will not be used in calculating the thirty (30) calendar  
days. If an employee does not return to work for the Board after FMLA Leave, the Board shall take  
necessary steps to recover the Board's share of the health premium payments made on the employee's  
behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA Leave unless:  
1) the employee's position has been affected by reduction in force and/or layoff;  
2) the employee has a continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would  
entitle the employee to leave under FMLA; or  
3) other circumstances beyond the employee's control. In cases where an employee does not return to  
work and claims the reason to be "other circumstances beyond the employee's control," the details  
regarding such circumstances will be reduced to writing and submitted for review by the Board's  
designee responsible for FMLA Leave. The Board may require additional documentation to support  
the employee's claim. The Board will use applicable Federal Regulations and existing case law to  
determine whether the circumstances claimed by the employee as resulting in the employee not being  
able to return to work were beyond the employee's control.  
1) The SRP’s position will be held.  
8. Continuous Service Health Leave Benefits  
a) The purpose of this provision is to extend certain insurance benefits to SRP who are not eligible for those  
benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and subsequent language as provided in  
Article VIII, Section C, paragraph 7 of the School Related Personnel Master Contract because their work  
calendar(s) (days and hours) for the preceding twelve (12) months does not equal 1250 hours or more as  
required for eligibility under FMLA, but who are eligible for Health Leave under Article VIII, Section C,  
paragraph 5 of the School Related Personnel Master Contract.  
Specifically, for this purpose an eligible SRP is one who:  
k  
—  
b  
—  
1) has completed ten (10) years of continuous employment by the Board;  
2) is in an insurance benefit earning position;  
3) during the twelve (12) month period preceding the unpaid health leave has been in a paid status for at  
least 95% of the SRP’s contracted hours. Holidays, earned sick leave, and vacation time for which  
the employee has been paid but had not worked shall be included in the calculation of the hours.  
Workers’ Compensation, suspension with pay, and Sabbatical Leave for which the employee has been  
paid will not be included in the calculation of the hours. Sick Leave Bank days for which the  
employee has been paid will not be included in the calculation of the hours. Should an SRP apply for  
Health Leave and such requested leave immediately follows Sick Leave Bank days which were

granted for the SRP’s serious health condition, the twelve (12) month period in which the SRP  
received pay will be calculated prior to the first day of approved Sick Leave Bank; and  
4) documents that Health Leave is required for the treatment of a serious health condition which prevents  
the SRP from performing his/her job. A “serious health condition” means an illness, injury,  
impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:  
a. any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to in-patient care (i.e., an  
overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility);  
b. any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school, or other regular daily activities, of  
more than three calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision  
of) a health care provider; or,  
c. continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or long-  
term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a  
period of incapacity of more than three calendar days; or for prenatal care.  
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not “serious health  
conditions” unless in-patient hospital care is required.  
c) The twelve (12) month period for entitlement of insurance benefits under this provision will be measured  
from July 1 through June 30.  
d) Any insurance benefits paid as a result of the approval of days by the Sick Leave Bank under the  
provisions of Article VIII, Section B, paragraph 6, will be counted toward the SRP’s annual entitlement  
of up to twelve (12) weeks of insurance benefits.  
e) The receipt of insurance benefits as mentioned in this provision is subject to the following restrictions and  
privileges:  
1) The Board shall require the SRP to obtain and to furnish to the Board the necessary documentation of  
a serious health condition as described in paragraph b) 4) b, and c of this provision.  
2) The Board may request that the SRP provide additional verification of a serious health condition at  
any reasonable interval.  
3) The Board retains the right to implement reasonable rules and regulations with regard to the approval  
of benefits based on a claim of a serious health condition. This includes but is not limited to requiring  
a second opinion, at the Board’s discretion, from a Board-paid doctor with regard to a medical  
condition, and the use of forms for requests for leave, physician documentation, and fitness to return  
to work.  
4) In the event that the Board exercises its right to a second medical opinion and the opinion conflicts  
with the first doctor’s opinion in the medical certification, then a third opinion may be required by a  
Board-paid physician mutually agreed upon by the Board and SRP. This third opinion will be final  
and binding upon the Board and the SRP.  
5) Board-Paid Insurance Benefits  
For SRP who are eligible for continuous service health leave benefits, the Board will pay the portion  
of the insurance premium which it normally paid prior to the leave, such as major medical, surgical,  
dental, life, and flexible benefits. The cost of these benefits will be paid by the Board based on the  
expectation that the SRP will return to work following the approved Health Leave. Return to work  
means that the SRP must return to work for at least thirty (30) calendar days following the conclusion  
of approved Health Leave or following the conclusion of other approved leave which is granted under  
Article VIII, and which is immediately subsequent to the Health Leave. Noncontracted days during  
summer break and unpaid holidays during winter and spring break will not be used in calculating the  
thirty (30) calendar days. If the SRP does not return to work for the Board after approved leave, the  
Board shall take necessary steps to recover the Board’s share of the health premium payments made  
on the SRP’s behalf during a period of unpaid Health Leave unless:  
a. the SRP’s position has been affected by reduction in force and/or layoff,  
b. the SRP has a continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle  
the SRP to additional health leave, or  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 30  

### ARTICLE VIII -- LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
### 
c. other circumstances beyond the SRP’s control. In cases where an employee does not return to  
work and claims the reason to be “other circumstances beyond the employee’s control,” the details  
regarding such circumstances will be reduced to writing and submitted for review by the Board’s  
designee responsible for approval of such leave. The Board may require additional documentation  
to support the SRP’s claim. The Board will determine whether the circumstances claimed by the  
SRP as resulting in the SRP not being able to return to work were beyond the SRP’s control.  
f) SRP are not entitled to more than twelve (12) weeks of combined leave in any year (July 1 to June 30)  
under provisions of the FMLA and Continuous Service Health Leave Benefits.

or Board policy.  
The Board and Union recognize that situations may arise in which an SRP may use reasonable force to  
protect himself/herself, students, or others from harm in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Code  
of Student Conduct. Any SRP shall immediately report any instance involving the use of physical force to  
protect himself/herself or another employee and/or student, or the restraining of disruptive students, and any

c) When an SRP is absent from his/her working responsibilities as a result of any provision in this section,  
there shall be no deduction made for Sick Leave allowance credited to such SRP.  
2. Absence from work related to an injury/illness-in-the-line-of-duty during the school year in which the ILD  
occurred shall not cause an SRP who is otherwise eligible and is drawing Workers' Compensation benefits to  
lose credit for seniority, step increases, insurance benefits, or contributions to the Florida Retirement System.

modified duty, benefits to which the SRP is eligible under Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, shall be paid while  
the Board seeks additional information regarding the medical condition, medical limitations, and/or medical  
restrictions of the SRP, or while the Board determines the most appropriate duty placement for the SRP.

SRP  
1. Any case of assault or battery upon or threat against an SRP in the performance of his/her duty shall be

determine the credibility of such threat. When administration has been notified properly the student shall not  
have direct contact with the SRP during school hours or on school property until the threat assessment is  
concluded and the SRP is notified of the results. If the threat is made by a person not under the jurisdiction  
of the school board, the SRP will not be required to meet with that person until the matter has been  
investigated and documented by the worksite supervisor and the SRP has been notified of the results of that  
investigation. The SRP has the right to have an administrator present at any future meetings with the person  
making the threat.  
2. Any student found to have committed assault or battery against an SRP will be subjected to disciplinary  
action as provided in the Code of Student Conduct.  
3. Compensation for death or disability shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Workers’  
Compensation Law.

SRP in the course of fulfilling his/her employment responsibilities or from any act by the SRP for the  
purpose of preventing injury to persons or damage to property located on the worksite during any worksite-  
related activity. The reimbursement of damaged or vandalized personal property (other than motor vehicles)

year.  
3. clothing and/or personal property is insured, the SRP must submit a claim to the appropriate insurance  
company. In the event of full reimbursement for such claim, the Board shall make no payment. If the  
insurance company reimburses all but the deductible amount specified in the SRP's policy, the Board will  
pay an amount equal to the deductible amount not to exceed $500.00. If the claim is for less than the  
deductible amount specified or the clothing or personal property is not insured, the Board will pay an amount  
equal to the current value of the property not to exceed $500.00. In determining the current value of personal  
property, factors such as the age, condition, and current replacement cost of the personal property will be  
considered by the Board.  
4. In order to receive reimbursement, the SRP must report the damage to the worksite supervisor as soon as  
possible and complete the Comprehensive Accident/Injury/Loss form and submit it to the worksite  
supervisor.  
5. After review of the initial request for reimbursement, the Board may require additional information and/or  
documentation related to the request, including a second estimate if the reported damage is to the SRP's  
personal vehicle. After review of the submitted information, the Board will provide to the SRP a written  
statement as to whether the request for reimbursement has been approved. If the request for reimbursement  
is approved, the Board will state in writing that the request was approved, and state with particularity and  
limitation(s) on the amount which may apply to the request. If the request is not approved, the Board will  
State in writing the reason(s) why the request for reimbursement was not approved. In cases which involve  
personal property other than motor vehicles, the Board may require that the damaged property be submitted  
to the Board's representative before the Board authorizes reimbursement to an SRP for the replacement  
and/or compensation for the value of damaged property.  
6. In the event the claim is for vandalism to the SRP's personal vehicle, a copy of his/her automobile insurance  
policy declaration page and an estimate for repair must be included with the Comprehensive  
Accident/Injury/Loss form.

C  
—  
All other SRP who work six (6) hours or more per day or thirty (30) hours or more in each normal  
working week for ninety (90) days or more per year shall be eligible for insurance benefits to the same  
extent as full-time SRP. SRP eligible for insurance benefits on November 19, 1987 shall continue to  
receive insurance benefits as long as they maintain current eligibility until such time as their employment  
with the district is terminated. If an SRP earning insurance benefits on November 19, 1987 drops below

are increased to at least four (4) hours, he/she again would earn insurance benefits.  
4. Insurance benefits are effective the first day of the month following the SRP’s completion of one calendar  
month of employment in a benefit earning position. If dependent coverage is desired, it must carry the same

and to the bargaining unit members on the first day of the annual open enrollment period.  
6. The open enrollment for insurance benefits shall be a minimum of thirty (30) days during the period this  
activity was accomplished during the 1987-88 fiscal year. A change in this period in subsequent years may  
be made with the mutual consent of the Board and the Union.  
7. Any SRP whose dependent status changes who wishes to add or delete dependent coverage after the  
enrollment period shall be restricted only by the provisions as stated in the Benefit Enrollment/Change Form  
(MIS #161).  
SECTION C —- PAYROLL DEDUCTION FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS  
1. The parties agree that the Union will be provided with two (2) payroll deduction slots in addition to the dues  
deduction slot. These slots will be used for Union-designated programs to include but not be limited to  
purchasing additional insurance, annuity, or other related benefits; voluntary Political Action Committee  
(PAC) donations; or other Union-sponsored voluntary deduction programs for bargaining unit members.  
2. The Union agrees to reimburse the Board for any actual start-up programming costs incurred which are  
normally charged to other groups who benefit from payroll deduction services.  
3. A single payment will be remitted after each pay period to a depository designated by the Union for each of  
the two (2) additional payroll deduction slots.  
SECTION D - EARLY RETIREMENT MONTHLY BENEFIT  
1. Effective January 1, 1997, the Board shall provide an early retirement benefit for all SRP who:  
a) are fifty (50) years of age or older at the time of retirement,  
b) have twenty-five (25) or more years of creditable FRS service,  
c) have reached the final step on his/her salary schedule,  
d) have completed twelve (12) years of Pasco service, the last ten (10) of which must be Pasco continuous  
service, and  
e) have retired under the Florida Retirement System (FRS) Defined Benefit Plan (Pension Plan) or who  
retires with any vested benefit in the Defined Benefit Plan (Pension Plan).  
Qualifying SRP who choose to retire early on or after July 1, 2001, will receive the early retirement benefit in  
accordance with the following:  
f) SRP who are at least fifty (50) years of age but less than fifty-five (55) years of age at the time of early  
retirement will receive an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the unreduced FRS retirement  
benefit. The unreduced FRS retirement benefit is calculated using the premise of the SRP being sixty-two  
(62) years of age at the time of retirement.  
g) SRP who are at least fifty-five (55) years of age but less than sixty-two (62) years of age at the time of  
early retirement will receive an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the difference between  
the unreduced FRS benefit and the reduced FRS early retirement benefit.  
At the time of early retirement, if the early retirement monthly benefit described in f) or g) above has a single  
sum value (present value) of less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) as of the date the early retirement  
monthly benefit is first effective, then the Board will provide a one-time lump sum payment equal to the  
single sum value (present value) of the early retirement monthly benefit.  
In lieu of the benefits described in f) and g) above, any eligible SRP choosing to retire early and who has out-  
of-state service, or any other qualifying service, and is eligible to purchase such service according to FRS  
rules and regulations, the Board may purchase such service if the purchase of such service would total thirty  
(30) years and enable the employee to full retirement under FRS. It is clearly understood that the Board shall  
provide the monthly benefit or purchase out-of-state service, or any other qualifying service, whichever is  
more economical for the Board.  
2. This provision shall not prohibit the Board from paying additional retirement bonuses provided for in this  
Agreement or future bonuses agreed to by the Board and the Union.  
3. No employee shall be required by the Board to take advantage of the provisions of this article.  
   
2005-2006 School Related Personnel (SRP) Master Contract Page 36  

### ARTICLE XI -- SALARY AND SCHOOL RELATED PERSONNEL WELFARE  
### 
4. If an employee chooses one of these aforementioned early retirement options, the Board will have no further  
obligation toward his/her retirement benefits.  
5. SRP who select one of these aforementioned early retirement options are required to retire from the Florida  
Retirement System (FRS) and terminate their employment with the district. Therefore, such SRP are not  
eligible to participate in the Deferred Retirement Option Program (DROP) as the DROP requires an SRP to
