or upon equipment which is not covered by one of the classifications herein specified, such employment shall,  
within three (3) working days after a work assignment is made or the equipment is operated, be temporarily  
classified by the appropriate Contractor Association and the Union.  
701.1. Temporary classifications and Teamster Craft wage rates shall be immediately referred to the Joint  
Adjustment Board which shall, at its next meeting, review and recommend usage of the proper classifications  
and wage rates. Either party shall thereafter have the right to submit a dispute under this section in the  
manner set forth in the provisions of the Teamster Craft Joint Adjustment Board.  
701.2. The Contractors agree when the number of pieces of Teamster equipment on a job or project exceeds  
the number of employees employed te operate the equipment, the Contractor shall not assign the operation of  
any of the equipment to any other employee not covered by this Agreement. If the Contractor is found, through  
the grievance procedure to have violated this Paragraph 701.2, the Contractor shail paya penalty contribution

violation occurred.  
   
   
702.  
703.  
704.  
The number of employees and the number of classifications of employces required to perform any operation  
covered by this Agreement shall be determined by the Contractor; provided that if a Contractor, in determining  
the numher of employees or the number of classifications of employees shall lessen the number of employees or  
the number of classifications customarily used to perform any such operation, the affected Union may have the  
issue of such reduction in employees or in classifications determined by the grievance procedure provided in  
Article V of this Agreement. In determining such disputes, consideration shall be given to the necessity for  
additional employees or classifications as well as to other pertinent factors.  
Because the Contractors and the Union recognize the necessity of eliminating restrictions on production and  
promoting efficiency, nothing shall be permitted that restricts production or increases the time required to do  
the work, and no limitation shall be placed upon the amount of work which an employee shall perform nor shall  
there be any restriction against the use of any kind of machinery, tools or labor saving devices, provided,  
however, that such machinery or power equipment shall be furnished by the Contractor and provided further  
that no employee shall be required to work under any conditions that are injurious to his health or safety in  
conflict with a present well-established custom regulating such use where the work is being performed.  
The Contractor shall promptly pay for all traffic tickets for overloads, spills and defective equipment where  
such violation is not the fault of the employce.  
704.1. The Contractor agrees to pay the concerned at his regular rate of pay for any time the  
employee is required to appear in court as the result of such violation, where such violation is not the fault of the  
employee, including reasonable time for travel to and from such court and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses  
incurred hy such employee in connection therewith.  
The Contractor agrees to recognize and observe Teamsters’ jurisdiction insofar as possible and that wage  
scales apply to classifications rather than to men, and the Union agrecs to permit the occasional temporary  
transfer of employees from one classification to any other classification, provided that, when such transfers are  
made, the employee shall be paid for the entire day on the basis of the rate of the highest paid classification in  
which he worked during the day. When such transfers involve the classifications of more than one craft, it shall  
not be necessary for the operation of this policy that employees be referred to a project by more than one union  
or employed at classifications of more than one craft. Abuse by any Contractor of the privilege granted in this  
Paragraph 705 shall subject him to withdrawal of the privilege for an appropriate period through the proce-  
dures established in the Teamster Craft Joint Adjustment Board.  
705.1. The Contractor understands and agrees that Teamsters’ jurisdiction 1s basically the operation of  
vehicles and equipment that are utilized for the purpose of transporting personnel, equipment and materials as  
defined in the various Internationa] Jurisdictional Agreements, Classifications covering work other than the  
operation of vehicles and equipment, within Teamsters’ jurisdiction, shall also be observed as set forth in the  
various International Jurisdictional Agreements.  
Each employee employed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall receive wages based upon the  
minimum hourly wage rates specified in Article XVIH calculated by the number of hours he was employed, less  
all legal deductions, Any other methods of paying the employees, such as the use of piccework, bonus systems  
or lumping of the work shall be deemed a violation of this Agreement. Grievances shal! be settled in accordance  
with the grievance procedure of this Agreement.  
The Contractor agrees that all work covered by this Agreement shall be performed by workmen who, the  
Contractor and the Union agree, are employees of the Contractor, or subcontractor, and that both the Contrac-  
tor and subcontractors shall employ such employees under the terms of the appropriate labor agreement  
covering the work involved.
