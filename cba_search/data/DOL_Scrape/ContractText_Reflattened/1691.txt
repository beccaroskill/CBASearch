Master Agreement fringe.  
2. When wage only is printed and is less than the agreement wage, then pay the published wage  
and the Master Agreement fringe.  
3. When wage only is printed and is greater than the agreement wage, then subtract the Master  
Agreement fringe to get the wage. (Wages will not be decreased in order to maintain benefit.)
