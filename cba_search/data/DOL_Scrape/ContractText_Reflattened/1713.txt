versa, but must make the change at the beginning of the work week and maintain such shift for at  
least one week. At no time will a crew work a combination of eight (8) and ten (10) hour days  
in the same calendar week.

and such first shift groups of employees who are relieved by groups of employees on a second  
shift, and on a three shift operation those groups of employees who relieve the groups of  
employees on a second shift, shall be construed as working multiple shifts. The intent of this  
clause shall be construed so as to recognize that a "reliever group” and a "relief group" does not  
necessarily mean "man for man" relief.
