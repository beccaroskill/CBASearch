performed at one and one-half and double time (see Schedule 17). The

a supplemental health and welfare insurance plan and/or one of the  
existing Pension Plans.

Fiduciary Agent which may be used shall be selected by competitive  
bidding upon by Trustees.  
5. There shall be no requirement that Employces sent to work outside  
the scope of this Agreement be paid fringes, nor shall the Employer be  
required to duplicate fringe contributions.  
6. (a) An Employer shall be considered "delinquent" for a particular  
work month if its required report and payment for that month are not  
postmarked on or before the 15th day of the following month (the "due  
date”), irrespective of whether such delinquency is willful or  
otherwise.  
(b) If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work month  
{as provided in (a) above), he shall also be required to pay, as  
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 10% of  
the payment otherwise due for such work month, it being understood  
and acknowledged by the parties that actual damages are extremely  
difficult or impossible to ascertain and that the amount so fixed as  
liquidated damages is reasonable.  
(c) If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work month (as  
provided in (a) above), as to any or all of the Trust Funds, and if the  
report and the full payment due for such work month (including  
liquidated damages), are not postmarked in the office of the Fund  
Administrator on or before the iSth day of the month following the  
applicable due date such Employer shall (in addition to paying the full  
amount due) be required to post in the office of the Fund  
Administrator a cash or fringe benefits surety bond (in a form  
acceptable to the Fund Administrator) for each month of delinquency  
in form satisfactory to the Trustees and in the face amount of the  
greater of $20,000 or 125% of the amount due (or estimated to be due)  
for the delinquent month, which shall cover all of the Trust Funds and  
assure payment of all sums called for by this Agreement in the event of  
the Employer's subsequent delinquency as to any or all of the Trust  
Funds, and which shall be kept in force and maintained in the full face  
amount for a period of not less than 12 consecutive calendar months  
during which no further delinquency has occurred on the part of such  
Employer.  
Should the Trust Funds reasonably deem itself insecure in the payment  
or collection of fringe benefit payments by reason of the Employer's  
past delinquencies, insolvency, insufficient capitalization, and/or lack  
of assets subject to attachment within the State in which work is  
performed, then the Fund Administrator, upon submission of an  
affidavit of its Fund Administrator to Employer attesting to same, shall  
have the right to compel the Employer to post a cash or fringe benefits  
surety bond (in a form acceptable to the Fund Administrator) in the  
face amount of the greater of $20,000 or 125% of the total fringe  
benefit payments reasonable estimated to come due within the six  
15  
months following the date of Fund Administrator's affidavit. This bond  
may be required whether or not a delinquency exists at the time and  
may be required in addition to a bond posted for a prior delinquency.  
The Union shall refuse to supply persons and shall prohibit Employees  
covered by this Agreement from working for any such delinquent  
Employer who fails or refused to provide or maintain any bond  
required under this Paragraph 6(c).  
(d) Hilustration of clauses (a), (b), and (c): [f an Employer's report and  
payment for the January work month have not been postmarked before  
February 16, such Contractor becomes delinquent at that point and  
must pay the full amount due, plus 10%. If the report and the full  
payment for January (including the 10% liquidated damages amount)  
are not postmarked before March 16, the Employer must then post a  
bond in addition to reporting and paying the full amount due. If, for  
example, the delinquency is $10,000, the required bond is $20,000. If,  
for example, the delinquency is $20,000, the required bond is $25,000.  
if a delinquency occurs in a subsequent month, an additional bond for  
that month ts required and must be posted. Further, for example, if the  
Fund Administrator reasonably determines that future delinquencies  
are likely to occur, another, additional bond may be required to be  
posted in an amount based on a reasonable estimate of the following  
six months of fringe benefit payments to come due, even though a  
bond for prior delinquencies has been posted.  
(e) The delinquent Employer shall also be required to pay al! costs of  
collection actually incurred by the Trust Funds, including all attorney  
fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter fees, and all other fees,  
costs and disbursements incurred by or on behalf of the Trust Funds in  
collecting the amount due. Trustees at their discretion may  
(from the Fund) the Unions for picketing and bannering expense  
actually incurred by the Union in collecting amounts due the Trust  
Funds, which expenses shall be deemed to be costs of collection  
incurred on behalf of the Trust Funds.  
(f) Each Employer who is required to make payments to the Trust  
16  
Funds shall promptly furnish to the Trustees, or the Unions, or their  
authorized agents, on demand, all necessary employment and payroll  
records relating to its Employees covered by this Agreement, including  
any other relevant information that may be required in connection with  
the administration of the Trust Funds. The Trustees, the Unions, or  
their authorized agents may examine such employment, or payroll  
records whenever such examination is deemed necessary by the  
Trustees, the Unions, or their authorized agents in connection with the  
proper administration of the Trust Funds.  
If any Employer fails or refuses to furnish its payroll records to the  
Trustees, the Unions or their authorized agents upon demand or  
refuses to afford the Trustees, or their authorized agents reasonable  
opportunity to examine the same in accordance with standard auditing  
procedures, the Trustees or the Unions may enforce such rights by  
legal action, in which event all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees,  
court reporter fees and other legal costs and disbursements, as well as  
the auditing fees and costs incurred in conducting such audit, shall be  
paid by such Employer on direction by the Trustees. The Unions shal!  
also have the right to take economic action to enforce such rights on  
behalf of the Unions and the Trustees and the Trust Funds shall  
reimburse the Unions for picketing and bannering expenses actually  
incurred in enforcing such rights.  
(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 11 Settlement of  
Disputes, the failure, refusal or neglect of an Employer to report and to  
pay sums due the Trust Funds or otherwise to comply with the terms  
and provisions of this Article shall not be subject to arbitration.  
(h) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of  
this Agreement establishing rates of pay, wages, all hours of  
employment and other terms and conditions of employment, including  
fringe benefits, apply to Employees employed in job classifications  
within the jurisdiction of the Union, from the first day of employment  
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EMPLOYEES ARE  
MEMBERS OF THE UNION.  
(i) No Agreement will be signed with any Employer who is delinquent  
with the submission of payment for fringe benefit contributions, past  
or present, unless or until fully paid. An Employer with a history of  
delinquencies may be required to post a fringe benefit bond in the  
manner and amounts as provided for in Section 6 (c) of this Article,  
prior to the execution of a new Agreement.  
7. Any and all fringe contribution rates shall be open for adjustment  
on any anniversary date upon thirty (30) days written notice to the  
AGC. Such adjustments shall operate to adjust wages in like amount,  
8 The Parties agree to the possibility of starting an annuity (defined  
contribution plan) during the term of this Agreement funded out of the  
existing package and administrated by the Pension Fund Trustees.  
9, Any employer signatory to this agreement may submit in writing to  
the Fund Coordinator, a request for information and shall be entitled to  
receive information regarding delinquent status of another employer.
