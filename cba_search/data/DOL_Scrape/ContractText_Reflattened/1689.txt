following the effective date of this clause, become and remain members in good standing in the  
Union. Employees hired or covered by this Agreement subsequent to the signing of this

an Employee is transferred by the Employer to a joint venture that is formed by the Employer, it  
is agreed that for purposes of Union dues and/or assessments, the Employee need not execute a

against for this reason.  
SECTION 4. JOB STEWARD  
One or more working stewards may be appointed by the Union from among its members  
working on the job that will represent the Union on the job. The Employer shall be informed of  
the names of the appointed stewards, in writing, and only such stewards will be accorded

working days. The two (2) individuals so selected will then name a mutually  
acceptable third member to the Arbitration Committee, who shall name a Chairman. In  
the event that the first two (2) members of the Arbitration Committee are unable to  
agree upon a third member within three (3) working days, the parties shall select an  
arbitrator by the striking method from a permanent list of Alaska arbitrators previously

SECTION 2. WHEN EMPLOYER IS ENGAGED IN CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS  
Notwithstanding the above paragraph, an Employee may be required to work more than six
