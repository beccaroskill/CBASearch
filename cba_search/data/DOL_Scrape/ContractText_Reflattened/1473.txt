each Employer in Good Standing corresponding to the average

- Employer. The Detroit Carpenters’ Fringe Benefit Funds’ Joint  
Delinquency Committee has authority to waive the delinquent  
Status of an Employer when the status was the result of errors in  
payment of insignificant amounts, bnef delays in payment, or  
errors due to unintentional clerical mistakes. A New Employer or

Standing may request a refund of his deposit to the extent it is in

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT  
CARPENTER BACK-TO-WORK PROGRAM  
A carpenter injured while working for an Employer may return to  
work for that Employer at a reduced scale of wages to perform a  
limited work scope, "Bridge Job," as approved in writing by the  
administrating physician. A Bridge Job is construction-related work  
which may or may not be within the work jurisdiction of the  
Union. The scale of wages will be determined by the administrat-  
ing physician's classification of the tasks to be performed com-  
mensurate with the capability of the carpenter. The work classifica-  
tions are:  
Very Light Work: Lifting ten pounds maximum and occa-  
sionally lifting and/or carrying such articles as dockets, ledgers  
and small tools. Although a very light job is defined as one  
which involves sitting, walking and/or standing may often be  
necessary in carrying out job duties. The amount of walking  
and/or standing permissible will be determined by the extent  
to which the injured body part impairs the ability to walk  
and/or stand.  
Light Work: Lifting twenty pounds maximum with frequent  
lifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to ten pounds.  
Even though the weight lifted may be only a negligible  
amount, a job is in this category when it requires walking or  
standing to a significant degree or when it involves sitting with  
a moderate degree of pushing and pulling of arm and/or leg  
controls.  
Medium Work: Lifting fifty pounds maximum with frequent  
lifting and/or carrying of objects weighing up to twenty-five  
pounds.  
The Base Wage for Very Light Work will be 30% of the Joumey-  
man Base Wage. The Base Wage for Light Work will be 50% of  
the Journeyman Base Wage. The Base Wage for Medium Work  
will be 75% of the Joumeyman Base Wage. For all work classifi-  
cations, the Employer will pay the full dollar amount of fringe  
benefits received by a Carpenter Journeyman in addition to the  
applicable Base Wage. Compensation would increase as the  
carpenter progresses through the work classifications based on the  
physician's approval of the next level of physical demand.  
The Workers' Compensation insurance provider may pay an  
additional weekly amount to the employee as an added incentive  
to encourage his voluntary participation in the Back-to-Work  
Program. This amount, if any, will be determined based on the  
formula as provided for by the workers’ compensation guidelines.  
Refusal of a reasonable offer of employment may jeopardize the  
continued collection of benefits in accordance with State law.  
37  
A carpenter's employment under the Back-to-Work Program is  
limited to a maximum of six months for each incident. Implemen-  
tation of the Program is discretionary on behalf of the Employer,  
and is subject to the availability of Bridge Jobs. Upon release for  
work by the administrating physician, the carpenter would return  
to full wages and be placed in available work.
