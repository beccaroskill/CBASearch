MBE-WBE subcontractors when the Employer is obligated to satisfy  
MBE-WBE recruiting requirements and goals, the percentage of work that  
is subcontracted to the MBE-WBE may be exempted from this Article.  
The Employer and Union shall waive this Article subject to Pre-Job  
Conference provisions of Paragraph 8.2.  
8.5. When the general Contractor receives bids that show the non-union  
subcontractor five percent (5%) or more lower than the union

Agreement, the following procedure shall be followed:  
9.2 STEP I -— Any Employees or Employer having a grievance shall present  
such grievance to the Job Steward or Union Representative. The Steward

9.3 STEP II - If no settlement is reached under Step I, the grievance shall  
then be presented, in writing, to the Employer’s authorized representative  
at the Employer’s office headquarters. The office headquarters shall mean  
the Employer’s main office, which has control for the territorial  
jurisdiction of this Agreement. If the grievance is not settled within  
fifteen (15) days, either party may thereafter notify the other party that the  
grievance is moved to Step III.  
94 STEP III — If no settlement is reached under Step II, the grievance shall  
then be referred to an authorized representative of the Employer and an  
authorized representative of the Union for the purpose of a settlement  
hearing. This may be accomplished by either party requesting, in writing,  
that such grievance be heard. If the grievance is neither heard nor settled  
within seven (7) days after receipt of such request, the grievance may be  
submitted to the arbitrator for arbitration by either party. However, either  
party may request that the time period be extended, by mutual agreement,  
in order to seek the advice of the negotiating committee or other persons if  
necessary.  
9.5 STEP IV - If no settlement is reached under Step III, either party may  
request, in writing, to the arbiter, that the grievance be taken to arbitration.  
The arbiter shall hear the grievance within fifteen (15) days after receipt of  
the request, unless it is mutually agreed to extend such time limit. The  
arbiter shall render his decision within seven (7) days after the grievance is  
heard, unless it is mutually agreed to extend such time limit. The arbiter  
may render his decision orally within the time limits and not be in  
violation of this clause. However, either party may demand a written  
decision to follow. The expenses of the arbitration, excluding attorney’s  
fees, shall be borne by the losing party.  
9.5.1 The parties hereby agree that the permanent arbiter be selected for the  
duration of this Agreement. The selection shall be made by both parties.  
Such arbiter shall hear all grievances arising out of this Agreement which  
are taken to arbitration.  
9.5.2 In the event the named arbiter is no longer available, the parties shall  
select a new arbiter from the American Arbitration Association within five  
(5) days of a written request by either party.  
9.5.3 Saturday, Sunday and holidays are deemed excluded from time limits

questions involving the interpretation and application of existing clauses  
or provisions of this Agreement.  
It is further understood and agreed that the arbiter’s decision may provide  
retroactivity not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from the day of the  
written filing of the complaint as set forth in Step I of this Article.  
Should the parties involved fail to comply with the findings within five (5)  
days after such written notification by either party or fail to comply with  
any of the provisions and/or time limits established in this Article, unless  
mutually agreed to extend such limits, then all means of arbitration shall  
be considered exhausted.  
Either party may take such actions as they deem necessary to enforce the  
findings and/or time limits and they shall not be considered in violation of  
any part of this Agreement, except that the terms of this subparagraph  
shall not apply to any disputes or grievances arising out of the

### ARTICLE XI  
### HIRING  
### 
NON-DISCRIMINATION: The Employer and the Union recognize that they  
are required by law not to discriminate against any person with regard to  
employment or Union membership because of age, race, religion, color,  
sex, national origin, physical or mental disability not related to job  
performance, or ancestry and hereby declare their acceptance and support  
of such laws. This shall apply to hiring, registration for employment,  
placement for employment, training, rates of pay or other forms of  
compensation, lay-off or termination, and application for admission to  
Union membership.  
   
Workers covered by this Agreement have certain accrued rights or benefits  
for themselves and their dependents. Such rights are generally continuous  
while under employment and remain effective until a certain period of  
time after lay-off or discharge.  
It is recognized within the construction industry that the Union affords the  
prime source of qualified workers (Operating Engineers). The Employers  
shall hire qualified Operating Engineers by telephone from the Union  
dispatcher. Whenever the Employer requires Operating Engineers on any  
job or project, the Employer shall notify the Local Union dispatch office  
by telephone, stating the location, starting time, approximate duration of  
the job, the type of equipment to be operated, the work to be performed  
and the number of workers required. The Union shall give the Employer a  
copy of the recorded dispatch for each Employee hired under this Article.  
GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS: The Employer and the Union recognize  
that an Employer should not lose jobs because of government  
requirements which are in conflict with the hiring hall. Therefore, when a  
government contract or government agency requires a different hiring hall  
arrangement to meet federal or state requirements, the hiring hall  
arrangement will be modified to meet the demands of those requirements.  
It is understood that the hiring hall will be followed as closely as possible  
without being in conflict with the government requirements.

11.3.2 AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT (ADA): The parties to this Agreement  
recognize the mandate to accommodate the disabled and agree that, other  
provisions of the Agreement notwithstanding, the Contractor may take  
reasonable actions as necessary to accommodate an individual who is or  
may be disabled. The Union agrees that it will conduct the affairs of it’s  
operations consistent with the requirements of the AMERICANS WITH  
DISABILITIES ACT.  
11.3.3 The Employer will notify the Union in advance of the commencement of  
the job of the government requirements, and upon request will provide the  
Union with a copy of pertinent provisions.  
11.3.4 It is also further understood and agreed that this section is not intended to  
create jobs where none exist.  
11.4 JOINT VENTURES: Any Joint Venture shall have the rights of any of its  
component individual Employers, and any reorganized company shall  
retain the privileges of its former position under this Article.  
11.5 TRANSFER AGENTS: The Employer shall have the right to transfer any or  
all Operating Engineers employed by said Employer from one job or  
project within Local No. 701’s territorial jurisdiction to another job or  
project within Local No. 701’s territorial jurisdiction subject to provisions  
of this Agreement. The Employer shall notify Local No. 701’s dispatch  
office prior to starting work on said job or project. It is understood and  
agreed for purposes of this Agreement that operations out of a fixed  
location are considered as one job.  
11.6 Composire Crew: Employers may establish for a project or job a crew  
or crews known as a “composite” which shall consist of the required  
crafts in such proportions as are respective to the type of work to be  
performed. In performing its work, the “composite crew” shall be  
allowed relaxation from strict craft jurisdiction, provided the Employees  
from each craft are assigned to their craft’s jurisdiction as far as practical  
and possible, but not inconsistent with the provision of this Agreement.  
11.6.1 The aforementioned provision shall first be arranged at a pre-job  
conference or subsequent meetings of the Employer and crafts involved.  
Any disagreement over this provision may be appealed to the chief  
representatives of the respective five (5) crafts and AGC.

11.7 PRE-JOB CONFERENCE: The Union, through pre-job conference or by  
virtue of a Memorandum of Understanding between the bargaining  
representatives of this Agreement and the bargaining representatives of  
other geographical areas, may allow certain Employees to be brought into  
the territorial jurisdiction of Local No. 701. Such Employees shall be  
allowed to remain on the job or project in the classification for which they

Employees shall not be transferred to another project, acquire Group I  
status and/or recall privileges by virtue of such employment.  
11.8 The transferring of Employees and the hiring of Employees by an  
Employer signatory to the National Pipeline Agreement for work  
performed under said Agreement shall be done according to the provisions  
of said Agreement. However, such Employees shall be allowed to remain  
on the job or project in the classification for which they were cleared or  
dispatched, only for that project’s duration. Such Employees shall not be  
transferred to another project, acquire Group I status and/or any recall

Operating Engineers Local 701. The Employer may request Operating  
Engineers members from outside the Local 701 to act as Foreman

the preceding twelve (12) month period. However, at no time shall the  
requested Operating Engineer Foreman from outside Local 701 exceed  
fifty percent (50%) of Operating Engineer Foreman employed on any  
job or project,  
(b) requests by Employers for a particular person shall be honored without  
regard to the requested person’s place on the Out-of-Work list,

other local of the Operating Engineers,  
eee?  
when the Employer has a bona fide need they may order Operating

construction industry may be subjected to various inherent, hazardous  
conditions such as heat, smoke, dust, noise, etc. which could be  
detrimental to their health, therefore, both parties pledge their mutual  
cooperation in rectifying such conditions.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
APPRENTICE WAGE SCHEDULE  
It is hereby understood and agreed that this MEMORANDUM OF  
UNDERSTANDING be incorporated and made a part of the Master Agreement between the  
Oregon-Columbia Chapter, AGC and the International Union of Operating Engineers  
Local Union No. 701, entered into on the, FIRST DAY OF JUNE, 2002, FOR THE PERIOD  
JUNE 1, 2002 TO May 31, 2007.  
It has always been the intent of the parties to allow the full zone wage  
differential to Operating Engineer Apprentices. The apprentice receives a percentage of  
Zone “A” base wage plus the full zone differential. Therefore, by way of example, a  
beginning apprentice working in a Group 4 classification in ZONE “II” would receive  
80% x Group 4 (Zone I is $26.09) = $20.87 + ZONE “II” differential of $1.50 for a total of  
$22.37. An 80% apprentice receives the Health and Welfare fringe benefit ONLY, full  
fringe benefits are not paid on apprentices until they have been rated to 85% or higher.  
The progressive wage rate to be paid applies to all apprentices regardless of  
their Major including Technical Engineer and Heavy Duty Repairer is:  
Period Hour Range Percentage of Fringe Benefit | Fringe contribution

Schedule A - 15 -  
   
ZONE PAY DIFFERENTIAL  
The parties to the Agreement recognize that because of remoteness of area and  
other reasons, there is a great inequity between the living expenses of an  
Employee providing for himself and his family in the major metropolitan  
areas and those of an Employee working in the remote areas within the large  
geographical area of this Agreement, and therefore, adopt the following  
provisions for wage scales as identified in the established wage/zone schedule  
attached.  
For the following metropolitan counties: MULTNOMAH; CLACKAMAS;  
MARION; YAMHILL; WASHINGTON; COLUMBIA; CLARK; AND COWLITZ  
COUNTY, WASHINGTON WITH MODIFICATIONS AS INDICATED:  
(A) All jobs or projects located in Multnomah, Clackamas, and Marion  
counties, West of the western boundary of Mt. Hood National Forest  
and West of Mile Post 30 on Interstate 84 and West of Mile Post 30  
on State Highway 26 and West of Mile Post 30 on Highway 22 and all  
jobs located in Yamhill County, Washington County and Columbia  
County and all jobs or projects located in Clark & Cowlitz County,  
Washington except that portion of Cowlitz County in the Mt. St.  
Helens “BLAST ZONE” that begins at Mile Post 29 on Highway 504  
shall receive Zone I for all classifications as listed in Schedule A.  
(B) All jobs or projects located in the area outside the IDENTIFIED  
BOUNDARY above, but less than 50 MILES from the Portland City  
Hall shall receive Zone II Pay for all classifications as listed in  
Schedule A.

basis of road miles and in the following manner. A mileage  
measurement will start at the entrance to the respective city hall,  
facing the project (if possible), and shall proceed by the normal route  
(shortest time-best road) to the geographical center on highway,  
railroad, and street construction projects (end of measurement). On  
all other pre‘ect contracts, the geographical center where the major  
portion of the construction work is located, shall be considered the  
center of the project (end of measurement).  
b. All related jobs or projects (such as a crusher’s location) shall, for the  
purpose of determining the proper pay zone rates, be considered as a  
part of the prime job, with the exception of jetties which for the  
purpose of this Agreement, will have separate locations and may,  
therefore, have a different pay zone for the quarry and Jetty sites.  
6. The Employer agrees to PAY TOLL FEES ON BRIDGES AND FERRIES provided the  
Employees shall furnish receipts for same.  
7. The Employer agrees to make every effort to provide suitable parking

Schedule A - 17 -  
   
JOB SITE TRANSPORTATION: Whenever because of remoteness of parking  
areas, hazardous road conditions, or security restrictions, the Contractor is  
required to furnish transportation for men within the job site to the place of  
their work, the project management and union will meet to establish any  
special conditions surrounding such manhaul operation. When the Contractor  
furnishes such transportation to the employees without cost to him, the  
equipment shall include seats and protection from the elements, and definite  
pickup and discharge points shall be determined. Payment of travel, at his  
regular rate, on the return trip will be paid to all employees, including  
discharges and layoffs. If job site negotiations fail, the procedure set forth in  
this Agreement shall prevail.  
It is understood and agreed for purposes of this Agreement that all operations  
out of a fixed location are considered as one job.  
No travel time, transportation reimbursement, or subsistence is payable under  
this Agreement, except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement (ARTICLE  
XII, Paragraphs 12.9 and 12.9.1, covering the movement of equipment and  
deadheading).
