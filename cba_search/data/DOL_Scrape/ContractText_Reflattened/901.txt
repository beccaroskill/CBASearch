employee. If the employer fails to do one of the above on the next business day after the  
discharge, the employer shall pay the employee $35.00 per day for each business day elapsed  
between the business day after discharge and the day which the check is sent or provided, to the

procedures shall be established at the beginning of each job. In the event of inclement weather,  
employees will call the company designee one (1) hour prior to the beginning of the scheduled  
start time to verify that day’s work schedule. Failure to do so forfeits the employee’s right to pay  
for that day, unless other arrangements have been made.

for except when it is necessary to transfer employees from one classification to another within

access to a project during working hours and shall make every reasonable effort to advise the  
Employer or his representative of his presence on the project. He shall not stop or interfere with  
work of any worker without the permission of the Employer or his representative. Where there is  
a security arrangement by the owner or the Employer on a job or project which involves persons  
entering the project being checked through a guarded gate or similar situation, arrangements for  
the business representatives to enter the project will be made.  
Craft Job Stewards.  
A steward shall be a working employee, appointed by the Union, who shall, in addition to his  
work, be permitted to perform his union duties during working hours. The Union agrees that such  
duties shall be performed as expeditiously as possible and the Employer agrees to allow a  
steward a reasonable amount of time for the performance of such duties. The Union shall notify  
the Employer or his representative of the appointment of each steward. It is recognized by the

other employees is eligible to act as steward, the Employer shall give two (2) full working days  
notice to the Union and the Union will either appoint a new steward from the remaining  
employees or relieve the Employer of his obligations under this Working Rule. Upon
