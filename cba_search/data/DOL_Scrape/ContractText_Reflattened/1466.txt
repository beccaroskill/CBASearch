### ARTICLE I  
### RECOGNITION  
### 
WHEREAS, the parties hereto are desirous of stabilizing employment and promoting harmony and  
efficiency in the relations between the Employer and the Union, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
The Employer acknowledges that the Union has offered to establish its majority status by allowing the  
Employer to examine authorization cards voluntarily executed by the Employer's eligible employees in an  
appropriate unit; the Employer is satisfied that the Union represents a majority of its eligible employees in  
an appropriate unit and has waived the opportunity to examine the authorization cards; and therefore, the  
Employer recognizes, pursuant to Section 9(a) of the Labor/Management Relations Act of 1947 as  
amended, the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for all full time and regular part-  
time journeymen, apprentices, trainees, foremen and general foremen performing carpentry work, but  
excluding all office employees, professional employees, managerial employees, guards and supervisors  
  
as defined in the Labor/Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended.  
(12) The Employer waives any right that he or it may have to terminate, abrogate, repudiate or cancel this  
Agreement during its term, during the term of any future modifications, changes, amendments,  
supplements, extensions or renewals of or to said Master Agreement, or to file any petition before the  
National Labor Relations Board seeking to accomplish such termination, abrogation, cancellation or  
repudiation during the term of any negotiated collective bargaining agreement.  
(13) Thus the Employer agrees it will not recognize, deal with or enter into contractual or other relations,  
either written or oral, with any other labor organization, agency, committee, group of employees or any  
employee or other person with respect to wages, hours and all other terms or conditions of employment,  
other than employees covered by this contract.  
(14) The term "employees" as used herein, shall mean all employees including journeymen and apprentices of  
the Employer coming within the jurisdiction of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of  
America, as modified or expanded by decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and/or the  
National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes. Any reference to carpenter helpers has  
no effect in this contract.  
(15) An employee performing collective bargaining unit defined in this Agreement shall be  
recognized as one of the following classifications: Apprentice, Journeyman, Foreman or General  
Foreman. All persons performing bargaining unit work regardless of their title, e.g. superintendent, shall  
be compensated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for such work performed and shall be  
subject to the requirements of Article ITI.  
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT  
(16) The persons, firms, corporations, joint ventures or other business entities bound by the terms of this  
Agreement are referred to in this Agreement as "Employer" or "Employers." The Employers and the  
Union by entering into this Agreement intend to and agree to establish a single multi-employer  
collective bargaining unit. Any Employer who becomes a party to this Agreement shall thereby become  
a member of the multi-employer collective bargaining unit established by this Agreement and hereby  
authorizes the Association as its representative for collective bargaining purposes with respect to the  
Union.  
(17) Employers covered by this Agreement shall be free to designate their own representatives for the  
purposes of collective bargaining and contract administration; however, such designation shall not affect  
the Employers’ membership in the collective bargaining unit established by this Agreement or the  
designation of the Association as the bargaining agent for the multi-employer collective bargaining unit.  
(18) Both parties to this Agreement agree to abide by the terms and provisions of the Agreement creating the  
National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes and the rules of the Joint Board.  
Should the Associated General Contractors of America and the Building and Construction Trades  
Department agree to a voluntary plan for the settlement of jurisdictional disputes, the provisions and  
procedures of any such plan will become effective on the date of such agreement.  
(19) The Employer and the Union further agree that the work under construction during the pendency of a  
jurisdictional dispute shall continue without a work stoppage on the assignment of the Employer until  
‘such time as the jurisdictional dispute is resolved as provided herein.  
   
(20)  
(21)  
(22)  
(23)  
The Employer agrees, as part of the consideration of this Agreement, that neither the Union, its officers  
or agents shall be liable for damages for unauthorized stoppages, strikes, intentional shutdowns or  
suspension of work if the Union is not responsible for the unauthorized work stoppage. The Union will  
notify the men when requested that a work stoppage is unauthorized.  
It shall not be a violation of this contract and it shall not be grounds for discharge, discipline and/or  
permanent or temporary replacement for an employee covered by this Agreement to refuse to cross a  
lawful, primary picket line whether established by this labor organization or any other labor  
organization.  

### ARTICLE II  
### UNION SECURITY  
### 
All employees who are members of the Union on the effective date of this Agreement shall be required

Agreement. Good standing shall be defined as "Employees shall have all union obligations fulfilled,  
including monetary obligations paid current, prior to commencing work. New employees shall be  
required to become and remain members of the Union in good standing as a condition of employment

### 
All disputes, claims or grievances regarding the interpretation or application of the existing labor  
agreement shall first be taken up between the employee involved and/or the job steward and/or the  
business representative of the Union and the Employer and/or his representative. No grievance shall be

extension is agreed upon. The grievance and arbitration procedure established herein shall be applicable  
to all signatory Employers.  
In the event a settlement is not reached, the dispute, claim or grievance shall be referred by either party in  
writing on an approved form to the Joint Labor Relations Board of the parties to this contract within three  
(3) regular working days. The Joint Labor Relations Board shall be a standing committee with  
representatives and alternates appointed by the respective parties. Grievances shall be entertained at the  
scheduled dates unless special circumstances, such as safety issues, dictate the calling of a specially-  
called meeting. No more than one continuance will be permitted. In the event a party to the grievance  
does not attend a scheduled hearing within the time period stated herein, the hearing shall proceed and a

interested parties. The Joint Labor Relations Board shall make reasonable rules and regulations for its  
own conduct. These rules and regulations shall be made available to all Employers and Unions. All  
majority decisions of the Joint Labor Relations Board are final and binding.  
In the event the Joint Labor Relations Board is unable to reach a majority decision within fourteen (14)  
calendar days of the scheduled hearing or any mutually agreed to extension, the dispute, claim or  
grievance may be referred to a single arbitrator for decision. If an arbitrator cannot be selected by mutual  
consent of the parties to the grievance, the Joint Labor Relations Board shail appoint the arbitrator. The  
arbitrator shall make such decisions as he deems just and proper under the Labor Agreement and after  
hearing any evidence adduced by the parties. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.

### ARTICLE VI  
### VIOLATION CLAUSE  
### 
Any Employer who violates this Agreement regarding wages and fringe benefit contributions shall  
reimburse all employees the difference between the wages or pay the proper amounts to the proper fringe  
benefit program if the Employer was otherwise in compliance with the Union Security Clause, Article  
[II, at the relevant time. If the Employer was not in compliance with the Union Security Clause, Article  
Ill, at the relevant time, i.e. the individuals who performed the work were not members of the Union,  
then the Employer shall pay the Union the full amount of wages and fringe benefit contributions owed  
under this Agreement. Reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the Union to pursue its case in either  
situation will be paid by the Employer, if found guilty.

furnished under this Section shall have as sureties thereon surety companies which are authorized to do  
business in the State of Ohio and such. bonds shall be in form satisfactory to The Union. The foregoing  
notwithstanding, any Employer who (i) signs this Agreement, (ii) does not presently have a bond and

(36) General  
1. In the event any employee benefit plan provided for in this Agreement and paid for by Participating  
Employer contributions is reduced or eliminated because of governmental action, the net savings, if  
any, to said Employer attributable to said governmental action shall be paid to the employee as  
wages computed as an increase in the hourly rate of pay. The increase, if any, shall be effective as  
of the first day the governmental action ‘is effective. Net savings is hereby defined to be the  
difference between the cost of the Participating Employer contribution to Health Fund or Pension,  
as the case may be, and the total cost to the Employer of the governmental program which caused  
the reduction in or elimination of the Health Fund or Pension program, as the case may be.  
2. If the federal government institutes wage controls in any form and any portion of this Collective  
Bargaining Agreement is deferred or cut back, the parties shall meet promptly; and, if the action of  
the federal government which caused the deferral or cutback makes it legally permissible to do so,  
the parties shall attempt to reallocate the monetary equivalent of the deferred or cutback wages or  
benefits in a manner that complies legally with the action of the federal government.  
3. If it is not legally permissible to reallocate the deferred or cut back portion, the Employer shall  
commence paying the wage and/or benefit rate that was deferred or cut back when and if it becomes  
legally permissible to do so, to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
4. It is acknowledged and agreed by the parties that upon the making of all contributions required of  
them by this Agreement, Participating Employers shall have no other or further obligation or  
responsibility to pay for, provide or otherwise fund any fringe benefits; it being the acknowledged  
intention of all parties that benefits from all employee benefit plans shall be limited to those which  
| can be financed from the respective Trust Funds. The Participating Employers shall not be liable or  
responsible for the failure of the Trustees to secure, pay or provide the benefits contemplated in the  
| employee benefit plans for any participant or -beneficiary. The obligation of the Participating  
| Employers shall be and is hereby expressly limited to the payment of contributions to the Trust  
| Funds and no more. If at any time any of the employee fringe benefit Trust Funds shall not be  
sufficient to pay out and provide all of the benefits provided for in the employee benefit plans, the  
Trustees shall take such action as may be necessary and desirable in connection with the reduction  
of the then existing benefits in order that the cost of the benefits shall not be greater than that which  
can be paid from the Trust Fund. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly  
acknowledged and agreed that the Participating Employer shall have no responsibility or obligation  
to increase its contributions to the Trust Fund beyond that otherwise expressly provided for herein.  
It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that the Participating Employer does not  
guarantee any benefits to any participant or beneficiary; the obligation and responsibility of the  
Participating Employer being expressly limited to its obligation to make agreed contributions into

package negotiated by the parties and reflected in this Agreement, to increase or decrease the  
amount of money being contributed to any or all of the existing employee benefit plans or  
deductions, they may do so upon the express conditions precedent that:  
(a) The Trustees of any Plan affected acknowledge and agree in writing;
