time cards, payroll and check registers. This includes any other relevant information that may be required in  
comnection with the administration of the Trust Funds. The Trustees, the Union, or their authorized agents may  
examine such records whenever such examination is deemed necessary by the Trustees, the Union or their  
authonzed agents in connection with the proper administration of the Trust Funds.  
If any Employer fails or refuses to furnish its payroll records to the Trustees, the Union or their authorized agents  
upon demand or refuses to afford the Trustees, the Union or their authorized agents reasonable opportunity to  
examine the same in accordance with standard auditing procedures, the Trustees or the Union may enforce such

an individual may reasonably be determined, the Employer will be held liable for all of the hours worked by that  
individual for whom the Employer is unable to produce satisfactory records verifying the type of work being  
perfommed by that individual.

Employer to report and to pay sums due the Trust Funds or otherwise to comply with the terms and provisions of  
this Article shall not be subject to arbitration. The Trustees or the Funds may proceed with legal action without  
pursuing or participating in any dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.

wages, all hours of employment and other terms and conditions of employment, including fringe benefits, apply to  
Employees employed in job classifications within the jurisdiction of the Union from the first date of employment,  
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EMPLOY EES ARE MEMBERS OF THE UNION.
