### Union Representatives  
### 
*  
Section 1. Designation of Representatives. The Union shall have the right to designate a  
maximum of forty (40) employees of the County who are covered by the Agreement as  
representatives, regardless of title or position held, including the Local President and officers.  
The County shall recognize such representatives upon presentation of their names in writing to  
the Director of Employee Relations and Personnel. Any changes in the representatives as  
designated will not be effective until after receipt of written notice of such change to the Director  
of Employee Relations and Personnel. Ten (10) of these representatives whose names will be  
submitted separately to the Director of Employee Relations and Personnel will only be allowed  
Union time off without pay and shall not represent grievants or handle grievances. All other  
sections of this Article shall apply.  
Section 2. Performance of Union Representative Business. Only employees designated under  
Section 1 above will be granted time off from work for the purpose of attending to any Union  
representative activities, and any such activities must be performed while off duty and without  
pay except in the following circumstances. No more than two employees from a Department will  
be permitted off for Union business at any one time.  
1) In the event Management requests a meeting with a Union representative during  
work hours, the County will be responsible for paying the representative.  
2) At steps one, two and three of grievance hearings with Management, the employee  
and one Union representative will be paid for attendance at meetings occurring at  
a time the employee would otherwise have been working.  
3) Employees may request the presence of a Union representative if called into a  
disciplinary interview or an investigatory interview that may lead to disciplinary  
action of any bargaining unit employee. In such cases, Management is responsible  
for paying the Union representative. Management can call in a representative  
immediately if available, such as when a representative is employed in the same  
department, or postpone the meeting for 48 hours to allow the employee to obtain  
a representative. Alternatively, Management must hold such a meeting after the  
Union representative’s working hours.  
4) One Union representative will be paid for attending a pretermination conference  
when the Union President cannot attend.  
No Union representative will be paid for meetings scheduled after hours.  
il  
   
   
Time during which an employee is off duty to attend to Union representative activities will be  
considered as time worked for seniority, insurance benefits, vacation and sick leave accrual  
purposes only, unless it accumulates to more than thirty (30) days per year, in which case the  
excess will not be counted for these purposes. In the event the Local President is a County  
employee, it will be one hundred-fifty (150) days for the president.  
Section 3. Requests for Time Off. Employees designated under Section 1 above will be granted  
time off for Union representative activities only upon the submission of a request in writing  
submitted to the representative's supervisor at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the  
requested time off. Periods of time off granted will be in increments of one hour and the requests  
will be denied or postponed if management believes that the absence of the representative under  
the circumstances will adversely affect County operations. In the event of a dispute concerning  
whether the representative will be allowed time off, it may be processed through the grievance  
procedure but shall be conclusively resolved by the Director of Employee Relations and  
Personnel at that step if it reaches that point.  
Section 4. Visitation. R epresentatives as designated under Section 1 ofthis Article and any  
other duly authorized representative whose name has been previously submitted in writing to the  
Director of Employee Relations and Personnel shall be permitted on the County's premises for  
the purpose of investigating grievances, adjusting grievances, or ascertaining whether the  
Agreement is being observed. Visitation for any such purpose shall not occur until 24 hours after  
notice to the Director of Employee Relations and Personnel, who shall not unreasonably deny the  
visitation.  
Section 5. Non-Interference With Production or Services. The investigation, handling, or  
adjustment of grievances shall not, insofar as is practical, be conducted by employees and Union  
representatives during normal working hours. If grievance matters must be attended to during  
normal working hours, it will be done so as to cause a minimum of interference with production  
or services, and employees who are to be so engaged shall be required to obtain permission and  
be without pay as set forth under Section 2 and 3 above.  
Section 6. Bulletin Board. The Union shall be permitted space on existing bulletin boards to  
post necessary Union notices of a businesslike non-inflammatory nature. All notices posted must  
be signed by an elected official of the Local Union and approved in advance by the Director of  
Employee Relations and Personnel. Notices in pre-approved format need not be resubmitted for  
approval for subsequent postings. The Union shall supply at its own expense bulletin boards  
where none exist or are not adequate, and such boards shall be placed at mutually agreeable  
locations.

the filling of any existing vacancies for which they are qualified, or failing that, they may be laid  
off. Upon request of the Local Union President or designee, the County will discuss the effects  
of the subcontracting upon the members of the bargaining unit; however, this shall not constitute  
a restriction upon the County's right to subcontract and lay off employees.

received. Applicants need only apply once every six months for each job classification.  
Application details will be listed in the notice.  
Section 2. Management retains the right to determine whether a permanent vacancy will be filled

promotional competitive selection procedure or the open competitive selection procedure from

bargaining unit applicants only if they have equal skill, ability and qualifications. Skill, ability  
and qualifications may be determined by interview results, the employee's official personnel file  
(in accordance with the Merit Rules) and written or practical examinations. Applicants with  
greater skill, ability or qualifications may be awarded a vacancy over an employee with greater  
seniority.

### Overtime/Hours of Work  
### 
Section 1. The workweek for payroll purposes shall be a seven (7) consecutive day period  
commencing at 12:01 am. Saturday and ending at 12:00 midnight the following Friday. A  
workday shall be the 24-hour period commencing with the employee's scheduled starting time.  
A workshift shall be that portion of a workday during which the employee is scheduled, or  
assigned on an unscheduled basis, to work. Overtime is that time during which a full time  
employee works over 40 hours per week, not including any sick or disability leave. Previously  
scheduled vacation leave, funeral leave, holiday, jury duty, incentive leave, and union time will  
be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime. If an employee works  
more than 12 hours in any 24 hour period, s/he shall be paid time and one-half for the hours in  
excess of their normally scheduled shift (not to apply to employees who may be regularly  
scheduled for 12 hour shifts).  
Section 2. Overtime premium pay shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) of the  
regular hourly rate of pay (including shift differential and permanent emergency call back

employees who normally perform the work and such assignments shall be made as equally as is  
practicable. Employees shall be notified of overtime assignments reasonably in advance of the  
assignment, based upon the reason for the assignment, and normally 24 hours prior thereto.  
Overtime work records shall be maintained in the Department Director's and/or Division  
Director's office and may be examined there.  
Section 4. Employees shall be notified of work schedule changes other than overtime reasonably  
in advance of the change and normally 48 hours prior thereto, consistent with the County's  
planning of its needs.  
Section 5. Employees shall be allowed one (1) necessary relief or rest period per one half shift,  
provided the time and length of the break is determined by the employee's supervisor (normally  
15 minutes) and the granting of the break does not adversely affect or interfere with operations or  
service to the public. If for any reason a break is not granted, this shall not be subject to the  
grievance procedure. However, breaks should not be unreasonably denied.  
The purpose of granting breaks is to relieve fatigue and mental strain on the job, therefore, it is  
not permitted to combine two breaks into one longer break, to use breaks to lengthen lunch hours
