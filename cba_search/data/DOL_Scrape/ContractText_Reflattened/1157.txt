The Union recognizes that, subject to all other provisions of the Agreement, the Company management  
shall continue to exercise its exclusive responsibilities to manage the business and direct the working  
forces, including all such rights and functions not expressly limited by this Agreement, within the  
guidelines of the contract. Among the exclusive rights of Management but not as a wholly inclusive list  
of them, are rights to plan, direct, and control business operations, production methods, and production  
standards; to determine job content; to hire and transfer; to promote employees in accordance with  
Section 13.1 of this Agreement; to select, instruct, assign and direct the working forces; to determine the  
qualifications and competency of employees to perform work; to establish and enforce rules and  
regulations; to suspend, discharge, and otherwise discipline employees for proper cause; to lay off or  
release employees because of lack of work or for any other legitimate reason; provided, however, that  
this Article III will not be used for purposes of discrimination against any member of the Union.  
The above statement of management's responsibility is subject to all the terms and conditions of this  
Agreement and is not to be construed to imply that the Union is relinquishing its rights to bargain  
collectively on matters pertaining to wages, hours and working conditions.

other arrangements to conduct the meeting will be mutually agreed upon.  

### ARTICLE IV  
### Seniority  
### 
Section 4.1 Seniority Defined.  
The seniority of each employee is based upon length of service with the Company.  
Section 4.2 Seniority Lists.  
The Company shall prepare a seniority list effective each January 1 and July 1, stating names, addresses,  
classifications, rate of pay, and the last date of employment with the Company with no time deducted  
for voluntary or involuntary layoffs, for all employees working, on leave of absence, or on layoff, but  
excluding employees on military leave. The Company shall, at the time set forth hereinabove, and  
containing the above information prepare a list, to the Company’s knowledge, of employees that are on  
military leave. Two (2) copies of the above two (2) lists will go to the Chairman of the Shop Committee  
and one (1) copy of each to the Business Representative.  
Section 4.3 Probationary Employees.  
All new employees will be hired in FM classification excluding Skilled Trades. Each new employee  
shall serve a probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days. During the probationary period, the new  
employee shall be subject to termination of employment, by the Company, atits sole discretion, and  
grievances may not be presented in connection therewith. Upon completion of the probationary period,  
a new employee's length of service shall date from the beginning of the probationary period. It is  
understood that the Company will extend the probationary period in only those cases that the work record  
of an individual is questionable and additional time is needed to appropriately evaluate the individual to  
determine if the individual should become a permanent employee. For employees hired after June 30"  
but prior to Juanary 1°‘, upon completion of the ninety (90) day probationary period, the employee shall  
be granted one half (1/2) day of unpaid vacation for each month during the probationary period in which  
the employee had perfect attendance. All hiring agencies must honor the negotiated bargaining unit work  
regulations as put forth in the contract.  
Section 4.4 Reduction in Force.  
The parties agree it is necessary that the Company retain an efficient and well-balanced working force.  
In the event of a reduction in force, whether by layoff or classification reduction, seniority shall be ona  
plant wide basis. The Header, Shafer, Group Leader and Special Fittings Welder classifications, shall  
be considered skilled trades. A notice of at least five (5) work days will be provided to employees  
scheduled for external layoff. Employees with the greatest plant wide seniority shall be retained in the  
plant and in their classification. Employees displaced from their shift and/or classification as a result of  
a layoff or a classification reduction shall, provided they have the reasonable skill and ability to perform  
the work in a satisfactory manner, have the following alternatives:  
When referring to the Tool Room and Maintenance areas, they will be considered as two areas (Tool  
Room and Maintenance).  
In cases of shift reduction where the displaced employee remains in his/her current classification, such  
employee may elect to replace a junior employee from a multi-machine/process position providing they  
have previous experience and can fully perform the job with minimal familiarization.  
A. Employees in the Tool Room and the Maintenance areas may replace the junior employee in their  
respective areas.  
B. Employees in any other area or displaced employees in the Tool Room and Maintenance areas may:  
1. Replace the junior employee who is being laid off, or  
2. offered by the Company, or  
3. Replace the junior employee in any previously held classification or FM or Servicing including  
choice of shift and area, as seniority permits, if qualified to fully perform the work of the junior  
employee being affected with minimal training.  
4. Return to previous job, including multi process/multiple machines and classification if seniority  
allows (if job is eliminated or shift is eliminated.)  
5. Accept a layoff in lieu of any of the above listed alternatives.  
If it is necessary that an employee be reclassified in order to avoid his being laid off, he shall receive the  
rate of pay for the job to which he is reclassified in accordance with the hours accredited to him in the  
classification from which he is transferred.  
Provided, however, that if an employee is reclassified to a classification that he has held before, he shall  
not be placed in a lower progression than he held before.  
Shift preference will be granted to those employees who have a shift preference request on file and to  
those employees, who are losing their shift or classification due to reduction of force, based on their  
seniority, at the time of layoff.  
Whenever possible the Company will offer a voluntary temporary layoff to the hourly employees,  
however, itis understood that there will be times in the best interest of efficient operations a mandatory  
layoff will be required.  
Section 4.5 Plant Shutdown.  
In cases of full or partial temporary plant shutdowns, consisting of one (1) day but not more than ten  
(10) consecutive work days, a two (2) week advance notice will be provided to the workforce. Limited  
manpower, if required on said days, will be scheduled accordingly:  
1. Senior qualified volunteer, in the classification (all shifts).  
2. Senior qualified volunteer, out of classification (all shifts).  
Should additional volunteers be needed, the Company may require junior qualified employees, from the  
classification, to work. If this occurs, such junior employees will be provided a five (5) day notice prior  
to the commencement of the shutdown. Once the schedule is posted, no further vacations will be  
approved for the shutdown period. In the event production demands increase between the fifth (5") day  
of notification and shutdown commencement, the Union Committee shall be duly notified and additional  
junior employees shall be required to perform such work.  
Section 4.6 Recall.  
Recall rights will be to all previously held classifications from which the employee was laid off,  
provided they have the necessary skill and ability to perform the work available. An employee may  
refuse recall to a classification, but in doing so forfeits all recall rights to that classification. However,  
if an employee is laid off out of the plant, upon recall to his original classification the employee must  
accept the available position. Verbal notice of recall (a phone call) will be placed to the employee’s  
most recent phone number of record by a Company representative in the presence of a Union steward,  
informing the employee of his recall. In the event that the Company representative is unsuccessful in  
the attempt to speak with the employee, the employee shall be granted 48 hours in which to respond to  
the attempted phone communication. After expiration of the 48-hour period, a second phone call to the  
employee’s most recent phone number of record shall again be made by a Company Representative in  
the presence of a Union steward. In the event that the Company is able to speak with the employee on  
either attempted phone call, such recalled employee shall report to work within three (3) work days of  
receipt of verbal notice unless such employee is otherwise employed, in which case, he shall report to  
work within five (5) work days.  
Should the Company representative be unsuccessful in speaking with the employee after the second  
attempted phone call, the employee shall be granted a period of 72 hours in which to respond to the  
attempted phone communication. If the employee has failed to respond to the attempted phone call  
within the 72-hour period, the next employee otherwise eligible for recall shall be contacted according  
to the above described method, and the originally recalled employee shall be placed at the top of the  
list of employees eligible for recall. Additionally, the Company shall send written notice (a letter) via  
traceable means (delivery confirmation) informing the employee of the previous recall attempts and the  
employee’s now current position at the top of the list of recall eligible employees. Should the  
employee fail to respond to the written notice with a statement of his desire to return to work and to  
remain at the top of the recall eligible list within two (2) weeks of delivery of the letter, such employee  
shall no longer be subject to recall and shall be considered as terminated.  
An employee who fails to report for work as stipulated herein or who has not been recalled for a length  
of time equal to his length of service, at the time of layoff from the plant, but not to exceed two (2)  
years, shall no longer be subject to recall and shall be considered as terminated.  
Shift preference will be granted to those employees who have a shift preference on file and to those  
employees who are being recalled to the classification, based on their seniority, at the time of recall.  
Section 4.7 Shift Transfer.  
In the event the Company operates more than one shift, employees will, to the extent practical, have  
preference of shifts on the basis of seniority. Shift transfers, when granted, shall be effective not later  
than the third new pay period following the granting thereof. An employee who has been transferred at  
his request shall be eligible to request another transfer one additional time in the twelve-month period  
beginning with the date of the first transfer.  
Section 4.8 Shop C ommittee.  
Members of the Shop Committee shall head the seniority list of the plant. Designated stewards shall  
head the seniority list during their term of office, secondary only to the Shop Committee. This seniority  
applies to layoffs and recalls only. Should a Shop Committee member and/or Union Steward volunteer  
for layoff, recall in line of actual seniority will apply.  
Section 4.9 Transfer to Salary.  
An employee in the bargaining unit transferring out of the bargaining unit to a salaried position may  
return to an open job in the bargaining unit, one time, as long as the employee returns within ninety (90)  
days from the date of transfer from the bargaining unit. The employee returning to the bargaining unit  
can only be placed in the first available job open for hire (no other employee has job preference or recall  
rights to this position). The returned employee will be eligible for all benefits effective immediately  
upon returning to the bargaining unit based on the adjusted seniority date at that time. The adjusted  
seniority date will be the employee's total continuous service with the company less the time the  
employee was in a salaried position. The returned employee will accumulate seniority as a new  
employee for the first six (6) months after returning to the bargaining unit, and this seniority will be used  
when the company administers the layoff/recall procedure, shift transfers and assigns overtime. The  
returned employee will not be eligible to transfer under the provisions of the job preference procedure  
until after six (6) months from the date of returning to the bargaining unit. At the end of six (6) months,  
the returned employee's seniority date will be adjusted and will be used when the company administers  
all provisions of the agreement including job preference, shift transfers, layoff/recall procedure and the  
assignment of overtime. This adjusted seniority date will be the employee's total continuous service less  
the time the employee was transferred out of the bargaining unit.  
Section 4.10 Current Information.  
Employees are required to notify Human Resources, in writing, of their present post office address and  
telephone number and of any change(s) thereafter. In cases where notification to the employee is  
required, the Company will not be held liable if the last known address and/or telephone number is  
incorrect.

Twice the basic hourly rate of the employee plus any applicable shift premium shall be paid for all hours  
worked on a workday commencing after 10:00 p.m. on a Saturday or on a day recognized as a holiday.  
E. Premium payments shall not be duplicated for the same hours worked under any of the terms of this  
Agreement and to the extent that hours are compensated for at premium rates under one provision, they  
shall not be counted as hours worked in determining overtime under the same or any other provision.  
Section 6.4. Shift Premium.  
A shift premium of fifty cents ($0.50) per hour will be paid to employees working the second shift. A  
shift premium of sixty cents ($0.60) per hour will be paid to employees working the third shift.  
Section 6.5 Assignment of Overtime.  
A. The company will make every reasonable effort to distribute overtime among qualified employees  
within their classification, area, and shift. Employees who are requested to work overtime will be given  
as much advance notice as possible, it being the intent that in the absence of an emergency, the employee  
will be notified of daily overtime, prior to the lunch period and of weekend overtime by the previous  
Thursday as set forth in the following paragraphs.  
An employee performing an out-of-classification assignment, for fifteen (15) days or less is ineligible  
for overtime until employees in said classifications are allowed to work first. The out-of-classification  
employee, however, is entitled to overtime in his/her normal classification. Should an out-of-  
classification assignment last more than fifteen (15) days, the employee will be considered in-  
classification for purposes of overtime scheduling.  
In the event an error exists with any overtime schedule after being posted, associates are obligated to  
bring it to supervision’s attention one (1) hour prior to the close of their workday, so that immediate  
correction can be made. An employee shall only be compensated for missed overtime opportunity if  
management fails to correct the schedule after receiving proper notification.  
10  
B. 1. Sign-up sheets for voluntary daily overtime will be posted each day for associates to indicate  
their availability within two (2) hours from the start of their regular shift. Overtime schedules will  
be posted daily prior to lunch period. Available overtime will be distributed between volunteers  
within the classification and area, then classification, provided they have the necessary skills and  
abilities to perform the work assignment and are willing to work the hour’s necessary, beginning  
with the highest seniority employee. The company reserves the right to request or schedule the  
employees in the classification who have not signed the volunteer list, prior to scheduling out of  
classification employees.  
On a daily basis, once overtime is assigned to employee(s) within the classification as set forth  
above, further available overtime may be assigned to senior employee(s) from other classifications  
provided they have the necessary skills and abilities.  
Daily voluntary overtime may be cancelled by associates up to one-half (1/2 hour prior to lunch, as  
well as supervision’s notice to employees of cancellation two (2) hours prior to the overtime  
commencement. If the Company fails to cancel overtime prior to two (2) hours of commencement,  
the employee may decide to work or not. If the employee fails to provide proper cancellation notice,  
the absence will be charged against the attendance policy and perfect attendance bonus plan.  
2. However employee(s) may be required to work up to six (6) hours of daily overtime per week,  
which overtime shall not be more than two (2) hours per day Monday through Friday, and shall be  
inclusive of voluntary and forced overtime. An employee who desires to refuse daily overtime in  
excess of six (6) hours in any week must so notify his supervisor on Monday of the week in question  
or, if he is given notice the overtime is being scheduled later in the week, at the time he is given  
such notice.  
   
C. The Company may request overtime work for the sixth and seventh workday (weekend) of a normal  
workweek in the following manner:  
1. First the company will select volunteers as follows:  
(a) The Company shall post a notice setting forth the classifications, areas and shifts to be  
worked on the weekend.  
(b) During a normal workweek the sign-up sheet shall be posted on Monday of the week  
and shall be taken down for scheduling purposes no sooner than 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday.  
(c) Employees selected for Saturday overtime will be notified by scheduled lunch period  
on the fourth workday of the regular week (Thursday) and for Sunday, by the scheduled  
lunch period on the fifth workday (Friday). If an employee volunteers to work overtime  
and is chosen, the employee must work. Such posting constitutes notification of the  
employee(s).  
(d) Qualified volunteers will be selected first by seniority within the classification, area,  
and shift. If a need still exists, senior qualified volunteer(s) in the classification (on the  
shift) will be chosen. Then, the senior qualified volunteer(s) on the shift out of  
classification will be chosen. Next, the senior qualified volunteer(s) in the classification  
(all shifts) will be chosen; and then if a need still exists, the senior qualified volunteer(s)  
out of the classification (all shifts) will be chosen.  
(e) When only one (1) shift is scheduled on a weekend day, senior employees will be  
chosen, regardless of shift, through the steps listed above. If only two shifts are working,  
third shift shall be included by seniority.  
2. On the sixth (or seventh, per Appendix G) work day, should the company fail to get a sufficient  
number of employees (volunteers) for weekend overtime work, then the Company may assign  
required overtime to junior employees on the shift within their area and then within their  
11  
classification and in the case of Multiple Process Operators by junior qualified employees. The  
Company shall designate one weekend per month where mandatory overtime is not required.  
3. No employee will work more than one (1) shift on a weekend day until all qualified volunteers  
have been scheduled a shift on each weekend day respectively.  
4, Employees not notified of their overtime selection or assignment within the time as set forth in  
subparagraph (c) above, will not be required to work weekend overtime, unless the employee  
volunteered to work after the scheduled lunch period on the fourth day.  
5. If an employee's voluntary or involuntary request for weekend overtime is accepted by the  
Company and the employee fails to work all or any portion of such overtime, that employee's failure  
to work shall be counted as an absence and charged against the Attendance Program and Perfect  
Attendance Bonus Plan.  
6. Employees working weekend overtime shall be paid the rate of pay for the work performed, or  
their normal regular hourly rate, whichever is greater.  
7. Employees who are on a scheduled full day vacation, during the normal workweek on Monday  
or Friday will not be required to work the adjoining weekend overtime, provided that the vacation  
is scheduled before lunchtime on Thursday. However, employees who subsequently cancel vacation  
scheduled for Monday or Friday, after having been excused from weekend overtime, will be  
"pointed" for missing that overtime under the Attendance Program. Such points will impact the  
Perfect Attendance bonus plan.  
Section 6.6 Reporting Pay.  
An employee who reports for scheduled or prearranged work and who has not been notified to refrain  
from reporting for work shall be guaranteed, either four (4) hours work at his basic hourly rate plus  
applicable shift premium, or pay equal to four (4) times his hourly rate plus applicable shift premium,  
less time deducted for tardiness, if any. Employees shall not be paid report-in pay if they refuse assigned  
work.  
The following shall be deemed appropriate notice when work shall not be available for reasons other  
than hazardous road conditions or the conditions outlined in the last sentence of Section 6.6: 1)  
Notification to the employee or a responsible member of his family given at least two (2) hours prior to  
his scheduled starting time, or 2) notice posted by the Company the day before on the Company bulletin  
board and notice given to the Shop Committee. This Section 6.6 shall not apply if work is not available  
because of an emergency such as work stoppage by employees, power failure, fire, explosion, or acts of  
God.  
Section 6.7 Hazardous Road C onditions.  
If the Company, due to hazardous road conditions, decides to close the plant, a notice of one and a half  
(1-1/2) hours prior to the start of the scheduled shift will be announced on the company call in line.  
Provided the Company has the technological capabilities, the Company shall also implement group texts  
for notification. However, implementation of the group text notification system will not otherwise relieve  
employees from the duty to check the call in line for plant closure updates. If the Company decides to  
close the plant due to hazardous road conditions before the end of the scheduled shift, those employees  
that leave work will be considered excused under the Program and will not impact the No  
Absent Day Bonus Plan. However, this will not be construed to relinquish an employee's right for  
Reporting Pay if the plant is closed after the start of his normal shift. Notwithstanding notification by  
the Company, if a snow emergency is declared by the county in which the associate is a resident, that  
associate shall be excused from work for the affected shifts. In that case, the associate shall be required  
to call in.

discovery of the falsification.  
E. Sick Leave. A Sick Leave will be granted for absence periods of seven (7) calendar days or longer,

great-grandparents, grandchildren, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law or daughter-in-law) for the  
purpose of attending funeral services, or the removal of life support systems. Such leaves of absence

the hours of 3:15 p.m. — 7:15 p.m. of a person other than a member of his immediate family listed above  
shall not be compensated for such absence; however, this absence shall not be charged against the No

An employee may be temporarily assigned to work which is normally performed by employees in  
another job classification. When such an assignment is to be made, the Company may request any  
employee in a classification to accept such assignment; if employees refuse, then the most junior  
qualified employee or employees in the classification must accept the assignment. Such out of  
classification assignments shall not be for a period of more than fifteen (15) days unless the assignment  
is to cover for an employee granted a personal leave by the Company, fill in for vacation, temporary  
Openings, or a medical leave, substantiated by a doctor's statement. When the Company becomes aware  
that a temporary opening will exceed fifteen days (15) (excluding permanent openings) the chairman of  
the shop committee will be notified of the expected length of the opening. When the opening is a  
permanent opening and exceeds fifteen (15) days the job will be posted for bid. Upon termination of  
such assignment, an employee will be returned to his former classification. Employees on leave who are  
expected to return to work at a later date will have theirjobs held open (not bid). However, if an employee  
is on leave indefinitely the Company may bid the job or use temporary transfer. If the position is filled
