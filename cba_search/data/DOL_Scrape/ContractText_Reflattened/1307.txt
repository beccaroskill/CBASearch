(b) To establish a high order of efficiency in said Industry  
by intelligent cooperation of Employer and Employee. |  
(c) To, so far as reasonably possible, eliminate strikes,  
lockouts, and interferences with work, with their attendant

involved, by the substitution in their stead of a peaceable and  
orderly machinery for the handling of all disputes which may arise  
in the Industry between Employer and Employee.  
(d) To raise the standards of the Painting Industry in the  
City of Chicago, Cook and Lake Counties, Illinois, and in whatever

Section 2. The Association and the employers it represents in  
bargaining, in response to the Union's claim that it represents an

Union has been authorized to and in fact does represent such  
majority of such employees in accordance with Section 9 of the  
National Labor Relations Act without the need for a Board certified  
election and therefore the Association recognizes the Union as the  
sole and exclusive bargaining agent of all employees in the  
bargaining unit.  
Section 3. (a) The Union recognizes the Association as the  
sole and exclusive bargaining agent of the Employer members of the

Association agreement, as to all matters concerning Employees in  
the Bargaining Unit.

exclusive bargaining agent of its Employer members and agrees to  
produce evidence requested by the Union to confirm this authority,  
including its Constitution, By-Laws, and applications for members.  
(c) The Association shall notify the Union of each additional  
individual signing up in writing within twenty-four (24) hours  
following the approval of the application for membership in the

agrees to recognize and deal, in his shop at reasonable hours of  
the day, with such representatives as the Union may elect or  
appoint. Each Employer further agrees to permit duly accredited  
representatives of the Union to visit his shop and offices at any  
reasonable time during working hours for the purpose of inspecting

this Agreement. The employer shall permit the visits within  
twenty-four (24) hours after receiving the Union's request.

and job stewards from among men employed in shop or on jobs except

concurrence of the Union, recommends the appointment of other than  
those in shop or on jobs. Where a steward is appointed from  
outside the Employer's workforce, he shall immediately be placed on  
the job.  
(c) Stewards appointed by the Union in shops or on jobs shall  
(unless proper cause for discharge exists) be retained in such shop

remain members of the Union in good standing as a condition of  
employment.  
Employees covered by this Agreement at the time it is signed  
and who are members of the Union at that time shall be required, as  
a condition of continued employment, to continue membership in the  
Union in good standing for the duration of this Agreement.  
Employees covered by this Agreement at the time it has been  
signed, and who are not members of the Union at that time, shall be  
required to join the Union seven (7) days after the date of  
execution of this Agreement and remain members of the Union in good  
standing.  
Good standing shall mean the tender of the initiation fees and  
dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining  
membership.  
(b) All Employers shall, prior to the completion of the first  
pay period, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after a new  
employee is hired, submit a list of all new employees to the Union,  
in writing upon a form provided by the Union which shall include  
employee's name, date employed, address, telephone number, and  
Social Security number. Failure to notify the Union may result in  
the Union withholding men.  
(c) Where an Employer is notified to terminate Employees by

then the letters from the Union to said employee and a letter to  
the Employer requesting such discharge, will be made available to  
the Employer upon request.

Three ($0.23) Cents per hour for each hour worked by each Employee,  
including apprentices covered by this Agreement, in addition to the

the purpose of an increased apprentice stipend or for purposes  
related to further the apprentice program. Contributions shall be  
made to the Chicago Painters and Decorators Joint Apprenticeship  
and Building Fund, hereafter referred to as the "Apprenticeship

rate as the Association members for those full-time employees of  
the Council and of its affiliated local unions who are or who have  
heretofore been qualified journeymen painters. Each local union  
affiliated with PAINTERS' DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 14 may elect to come

purpose of providing apprenticeship training to eligible persons.  
It is expressly understood and agreed that the Agreement and  
Declaration of Trust, together with all amendments, rules,  
regulations, policies, and procedures adopted pursuant thereto are  
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof, and that  
all Employers party to this Collective Bargaining Agreement agree  
to become or remain bound by and to be considered a party to said  
Agreement and Declaration of Trust as if said Employers had signed  
the original copies of the aforementioned Trust instruments and all  
the amendments thereto. All Employers party to this Agreement  
hereby ratify and confirm the appointment of the Employer Trustees  
of said Trust, who shall, together with their successor Trustees  
designated in the manner provided in said Agreement and Declaration  
of Trust, and jointly with an equal number of Trustees appointed by  
the Union, carry out the terms and conditions of the Trust  
Agreements.  
(b) The Association has designated three (3) Trustees as  
Employer Representatives. The Union has designated three (3)  
Trustees as Employee Representatives. The and  
Declaration of Trust provides the terms of the Trustees and the  
terms of all future Trustees and that whenever a Trustee's term  
expires or a vacancy in any trusteeship occurs or exists, the  
Association shall chose or designate the person to fill such  
Employer trusteeship and the Union shall choose or designate the  
person to fill each Employee Trusteeship.  
Section 3. (a) Each Employer shall furnish the Trustees with  
information such as the names of all subcontractors and all  
Employees, classifications, Social Security numbers, wages, and/or  
hours worked, and such other information as may be required for the  
proper and efficient administration of the Apprenticeship Fund.  
(b) The Union and/or the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Fund  
Shall have the authority to audit the books and records of a  
participating Employer, either directly or through their authorized  
representative, whenever such examination is, in their sole  
discretion, deemed necessary for the purpose of determining  
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Each  
participating Employer shall make its books and records available  
31  
to the trustees for such purpose. Such books and records shall  
include, but not be limited to, all cash disbursement journals,  
payroll records, time records, or any other documents which form  
the basis of individual payroll records, state unemployment  
compensation returns, Union Pension, Welfare, Apprentice, and  
Deferred Savings records to other funds, and all other relevant  
records which would show payment of wages or fringe benefits. The  
information supplied by the Employer shall remain confidential and  
shall be used solely to determine or establish whether or not  
proper wages and contributions have been made. In the event the  
audit discloses that the Employer, during the period of the audit,  
has underpaid its contributions and/or wages, the Employer shall be  
liable for the costs of the examination, including, but not limited  
to, audit fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees. The Trustees'  
authority to waive any costs shall be governed by the terms of the  
Trust Agreement. The Union shall not be bound beyond the terms of  
its Constitution and By-Laws.  
If any Employer has employed a person or entity in violation  
of Article XI, Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement, the number of  
hours with respect to which such employer owes benefit  
contributions shall be computed by dividing the total dollar amount  
paid to such Employees as compensation for the work involved by the  
actual hourly wage rate paid. In any instance where this contract  
is violated by the use of piecework rather than hours of work as  
the basis of payment, the compensation actually received by the  
Employee will be divided by fifty percent (50%) of the contractual  
hourly wage rate in order to better approximate the number of hours  
actually worked. The number of hours so determined shall be  
presumed to be the number of hours upon which benefit contributions  
are owed with respect to such Employee. The Employer shall receive  
credit for all material expenses that can be established.  
(c) In the event the Trustees place a delinquent Employer's  
account in the hands of legal counsel for collection, the Employer  
shall be liable for reasonable attorneys' fees, and for all  
reasonable costs incurred in the collection process, including  
court fees, audit fees, etc. Reasonable attorneys' fees shall  
mean: All reasonable attorneys' fees in the amounts which the  
Trustees become legally bound to pay, including fees incurred for  
the recovery of liquidated damages, interest, audit costs, filing  
fees, and any other expenses incurred by the Trustees.  
Section 4. Failure of any Employer, after reasonable notice  
by the trustees so to do, to furnish reports, pay contributions, or  
comply with the rules and regulations formulated and promulgated by  
the Trustees of the Apprenticeship Fund, shall be considered a  
violation of the terms and conditions of this Collective Bargaining  
Agreement.  
Section 5. The rules and regulations governing apprentices  
adopted by the Apprenticeship Fund from time to time and approved  
32  
by the PAINTERS' DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 14 and the PAINTING AND

hired first, and if none are available then apprentices from other  
counties may be considered. Should apprentices from other counties  
be hired to perform work within the geographical jurisdiction of  
the Union, such apprentices must attend the trade school  
administering the PDC 14 program, and the Employer shall make  
contributions to the PDC 14 Apprentice Fund on their behalf and pay  
such apprentices in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
