of Government requirements, which are in conflict with the hiring hall. Therefore, when a government  
contract or Government Agency requires a different hiring hall arrangement to meet Federal or State  
requirements, the hiring hall arrangement will be modified to meet the demands of those  
requirements. It is understood that the hiring hal! will be followed as closely as possible without being  
in conflict with the Government requirements.  
The Contractor will notify the Union in advance of the commencement of the job of the  
Government requirements, and upon request will provide the Union with a copy of pertinent  
provisions.
