STAFF ASSOCIATION (hereinafter referred to as the “Association” or “APSA’’).  

### ARTICLE I  
### 100 RECOGNITION  
###

employees employed in a unit described as follows:  
102 Included: All regular employees employed by the Corporation as non-supervisory MTS  
Level I, Level I, and Level III at the following locations: El Segundo, California; Vandenberg Air Force

103 Excluded: All other employees, confidential employees, clerical employees, guards, and  
supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act.  
104 The Corporation procures labor services from outside suppliers to augment the normal  
efforts of bargaining unit employees. The Corporation agrees that purchased labor and/or consultants shall  
not be used to replace employees in the bargaining unit.  
105 The Corporation agrees that it shall make the recognition of the Association as the  
exclusive bargaining agent of its employees in the above described unit a condition of any sale or merger of  
the Corporation to or with a successor employer. Prior to the sale or merger of the Corporation to or with a  
successor employer the Corporation shall provide the Association with the language in the agreement of  
sale or merger that provides that the successor employer will recognize the Association as the exclusive  
bargaining agent of the employees in the above described unit.  
106 Within ten (10) days from the execution of this Agreement APSA shall certify in writing to  
the Corporation the names of its representatives accredited to represent the bargaining unit with regard to  
this Agreement. APSA shall also provide an updated list within five (5) days of any change. The total  
number of corporate employees so accredited shall not exceed one (1) representative and/or alternate at  
each location except that there may be five (5) regular representatives and three (3) alternates designated  
with regard to El Segundo. Alternates shall function only in case of the inability of a regular representative  
to fulfill his or her function hereunder.  

### ARTICLE II  
### 200 RIGHTS OF MANAGEMENT  
### 
201 The management of the Corporation and the direction of the work force are vested  
exclusively in the Corporation. These rights of management shall include, but shall not be limited to, the  
right to determine the size of the work force and the number of employees or other persons, if any, assigned  
to any classification or activity, determine the type of work to be performed or to be discontinued, the  
location, methods, schedules of work and means of accomplishing the work, hire, promote, demote,  
transfer, classify, reclassify, assign work to employees outside of their normal classification, and effect  
reductions in force, discharge, suspend or otherwise discipline employees for just cause, determine when  
and whether overtime should be worked, and by whom, and change from time to time any of its policies or  
procedures that affect bargaining unit employees’ pay rates, fringe benefits and/or conditions of work with  
advance notice to the Association and good faith bargaining with APSA in an attempt to reach an  
agreement. If such bargaining produces an agreement, that agreement shall be reduced to writing. If no  
agreement is reached, after impasse the Corporation may implement the change except as expressly limited  
by one or more specific clause or clauses of this Agreement. Changes in policies or procedures which do  
not fall within the foregoing scope, broadly construed, may be implemented by the Corporation without  
advance notice to APSA, provided that, if APSA requests an opportunity to discuss any change which the  
Corporation deemed not subject to advance notice, including any change in the implementation of any  
policy or practice, the Corporation will then discuss the matter promptly.  
202 + Any new policy and all changes to Polices and/or Practices which involve Recognition of  
Achievements and Striving for Excellence (AE), Human Resources (HR), Safety-Injury and Illness  
Prevention Program (SA), Security Program (SE), Standards of Business Conduct (ST), will be coordinated  
with APSA by Labor Relations in advance of implementation pursuant to Paragraph 201. All other new  
policies will be reviewed by Labor Relations and the Office of the General Counsel to determine if they  
affect bargaining unit employees’ pay rates, fringe benefits and/or conditions of work. New policies so  
identified will be coordinated in advance with APSA pursuant to Paragraph 201. In addition, upon  
execution of the Agreement, the Labor Relations Administrator will meet with designated representatives of  
APSA to identify which other Policies or Practices affect bargaining unit employees’ pay rates, fringe  
benefits and/or conditions of work. Changes in such policies will thereafter be coordinated in advance of  
implementation pursuant to Paragraph 201. The Corporation may specify reasonable time limits for re-  
sponse and for the commencement of discussion. The Corporation shall provide APSA with two (2) paper  
copies of new and/or revised Policies and Practices.  
203 Any new summary plan description and all changes to and/or deletions of Summary Plan  
Descriptions will be coordinated with APSA in advance of implementation. This process is informal,  
allowing APSA to pose questions and make suggestions for changes to the proposed content of these  
documents. There will be no negotiations or written agreement involved in this process. The Corporation  
may specify reasonable time limits for response from APSA.  

### ARTICLE III  
### 300 UNION SECURITY  
### 
301 Voluntary Membership and Maintenance of Membership  
302 Each member of the bargaining unit may elect to join APSA but shall not be required to do

303 Each member of the bargaining unit who is, or elects to become, a member of APSA on or  
after the thirtieth (30th) day following the effective date of this Agreement shall be required, while a  
member of the bargaining unit, to continue membership in APSA for the duration of this Agreement to the  
extent of tendering the membership dues uniformly required as a condition of retaining membership in  
APSA.  
304 Any member of the bargaining unit who has elected to become a member of APSA may  
withdraw from membership in APSA by giving notification in writing to APSA and to the Corporation of  
his or her desire to withdraw.  
305 Deduction of Dues  
306 The Corporation shall deduct Association member’s dues from the earnings of employees  
who are members of the bargaining unit upon the following conditions and at the time and in the manner  
hereinafter provided.  
307 Deductions will only be made from the earnings of a member of the bargaining unit who  
has executed and delivered to the Corporation a written authorization each time the employee enters or  
re-enters the bargaining unit. The authorization shall be in the form set forth in Appendix A.  
308 When Deduction is Taken: Each current week’s Association membership dues as  
authorized will be deducted from an employee’s weekly earnings provided:  
309 An authorization card has been received by Payroll at least four (4) weeks prior to the  
Payroll period for which the authorization is to be effected and has not been revoked, and  
310 The Association has certified in writing to the Corporation the amount of such dues.  
Certification and any changes thereto received during any week will be made effective the week beginning  
four (4) weeks after receipt of such certification for each APSA member who has executed a new  
authorization form in accordance with Paragraph 309 above. Once the Association has certified the amount,  
such certification will remain in effect until changed by the Association.  
311 Remittance and Statements to the Association  
312 Each week, the Corporation shall remit by electronic transfer, to an APSA-designated bank  
account, the amount of dues collected.  
313 The Corporation shall furnish a weekly report (Report 104-50, SAP-ZHRRAWDO,  
Register of APSA Dues Deductions) as of the last day of work to APSA. This report shall be furnished in  
paper copy only, shall be organized by employee badge number, and shall contain the following  
information:  
314 a. The total amount of current dues deducted.  
315 b. Employee name, employee badge number, four-digit cost center code, current  
automatic dues deduction (yes/no), weekly deduction amount, and the year-to-date amount

automatic dues deduction (yes/no), weekly deduction amount, and the year-to-date amount  
for each employee who had authorized such deductions but from whose earnings no  
deductions were made because their paychecks were insufficient to enable the Corporation  
to make appropriate deductions.  
317 Indemnity Agreement  
318 The Association shall indemnify and save the Corporation harmless against any and all  
claims, demands, lawsuits or other forms of liability including costs and attorney fees that may arise out of  
or by reason of actions taken by the Corporation in making payroll deductions as herein provided or in  
complying with this Article.

### ARTICLE V  
### 500 APSA LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
### 
501 Requests for leaves of absence for Association business matters will be treated on the same  
basis as all other requests for unpaid personal leaves of absence except that, upon a written request from  
APSA, approval of a maximum of one (1) week of such leave shall be granted unless extraordinary  
circumstances prevent it.  

### ARTICLE VI  
### 600 MERIT EMPLOYMENT PROVISIONS  
### 
601 Full-Time and Part-Time Employment  
602 Recording of effort by bargaining unit employees is set forth in Appendix C, Work  
Environment, Section 7, Exempt Employees — Distribution of Effort.  
603 Part-time employment for bargaining unit employees is set forth in Appendix C, Work  
Environment, Section 8, Exempt Employees - Part-Time Employment.  
604 Determination of Performance  
605 Each member of the bargaining unit shall have his or her performance evaluated and  
documented by supervision at least yearly and updated in the event of transfer. In the event of significant  
changes in performance, changes in content of the employee’s work, or in the event of promotion, reduction  
in force, or other reason, an additional evaluation may be performed. Any significant improvement or  
decline in an MTS’s performance ratings in comparison with previous years must be explained in Part II B  
of the Performance Evaluation Form, which contains the supervisor’s comments. This explanation should  
specifically identify, where appropriate, any apparent decline or increase in an MTS’s rating because of a  
change in the manner or method of evaluation.  
606 The performance documentation shall include an evaluation of the bargaining unit member,  
using a list of performance factors and appropriate performance indicators. Where factors other than those  
listed on the review form are also relevant because of the nature of the job, such other factors may also be  
utilized by supervision. Where factors other than the established factors set forth in the Performance  
11  
Evaluation Form are determined by management to be relevant in evaluating an MTS’s performance in a  
particular position, those factors should be identified and discussed with the MTS sufficiently in advance to  
fairly advise the employee and subsequently be identified on the form itself.  
607 Each employee will be informed of his or her evaluation in the course of a personal  
discussion with supervision. The employee will have the opportunity to comment on the evaluation verbally  
and in writing. Any written comments will become part of the evaluation record and a copy of the  
evaluation will be given to the employee.  
608 Each employee in an organization is ranked according to value. If desired, the employee  
may verbally request to receive in writing marked as “High Sensitivity” and “Aerospace Internal Use Only”  
his/her value ranking and a brief narrative describing its basis. Employee value rankings are reported to the  
individual employee in one (1) of five (5) groups (also known as "bins"), of approximately 1-10, 11-30, 31-  
70, 71-90, and 91-100 percent. In small organizations such as those with less than 10 employees, fewer  
groups may be utilized in reporting value rankings. Specifically, an employee may request to be informed  
where he/she is in the bottom group.  
609 Where an employee’s performance is established as unsatisfactory or has significantly  
declined, that fact shall be stated on the evaluation form and the employee given the opportunity to discuss  
with supervision the reasons for that judgment and the areas where improvement is required.  
610 The performance management process for the MTS is described in Appendix C, Work  
Environment, Section 1, Performance Management Process.  
611 Transfers  
612 ~All open job positions within the bargaining unit shall be posted or communicated to all  
Corporate locations unless a specific determination is made to the contrary by the cognizant Level 6 Vice  
President.  
613 The Corporation shall provide APSA with a monthly report (Report 021-116, SAP-  
ZHRRAPSO, APSA Report on the Exempt Active Population) in paper copy only indicating employees who  
have transferred into and out of the bargaining unit. This report includes bargaining unit employees who  
have entered or terminated employment from, changed status, or transferred within the Corporation. This  
report shall include the following information for each bargaining unit member: employee badge number,  
employee name, four-digit cost center code, pay plan, organization level and status.  
614 — All applications for posted positions shall be written and full consideration shall be given to  
all such applications. A member of the bargaining unit may apply for any open position without prejudice to  
his or her current position. In administering the provisions of this paragraph, the Corporation will send a  
letter to job applicants with the following text:  
“Your request for transfer for the above noted personnel requisition has been received and referred  
to the appropriate supervisor.”  
“Tt is the practice of the Human Resources Division not to notify the Supervisor of an employee  
who is seeking a transfer. It is felt that such notice by an employee to her or his Supervisor is good  
business practice but it is not required.”  
12  
615 Transfers will be made at the discretion of the Corporation based upon management’s  
assessment of the operational requirements and of the applying employee’s suitability. Unsuccessful  
applicants for posted jobs shall, upon rejection, be informed in writing of the reasons therefore.  
616 No bargaining unit employee shall, except under unusual circumstances, be involuntarily  
reclassified to a position at a lower level as a result of reorganization or otherwise without having been  
given at least forty-five (45) calendar days to seek another position with the Corporation.  
617 The corporation’s policy is not to transfer an employee into an organization where the  
employee would be reporting to the same manager/supervisor as a family member or domestic partner.  
Family members and domestic partners may not be in a supervisory relationship.  
618 The limit of 6 pending transfers can be waived on a case-by-case basis by the Human  
Resources Department.  
619 The limit of 6 pending transfers is waived for those in displaced status or those notified  
they have been selected for a reduction in force.  
620 Reduction in Force (RIF)  
621 Whenever it becomes necessary to reduce or change the composition of the working force  
because of lack of work, the imposition of budgetary changes, a reorganization of tasks, changing  
requirements for particular skills or occupations or other reasons, management may select employees for  
reduction in force. Ability to perform the remaining work, performance as an Aerospace employee, and, to  
the extent it bears upon the foregoing, experience gained in years of service at Aerospace and elsewhere  
shall be considered by Management in selecting employees for RIF. All members of the bargaining unit  
shall be evaluated on a non-discriminatory basis. It is the intent of the Corporation to select employees for  
RIF from as broad a base as is suitable under the circumstances; however, the provisions of this Article do  
not require that all reductions are Corporate-wide in scope nor restrict the Corporation’s right to transfer  
employees or to offer transfers and/or reclassifications to employees affected by reduction in force. In cases  
of RIF, the Corporation agrees to expedite its review of applications for transfer in those situations where  
the Corporation believes transfers may be warranted.  
622 Employees who are eligible to enter retirement from active employment and who have been  
selected for termination of employment as part of a RIF shall not be required to forego severance pay as a  
condition to invoking retirement status.  
623 In the event of a RIF, access of RIF’d ees to Aerospace facilities shall not be limited  
beyond normal controls for regular employees between 7:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday  
(except holidays). Exceptions may be made where program security or individual circumstances warrant.  
624 Rehire  
625 The Corporation shall establish a roster consisting of the names of those employees whose  
employment has been terminated under the provisions of Paragraph 621 of this Agreement. At the  
termination interview, employees shall be informed of the Corporation’s rehire policy as specified in  
Paragraph 650 of this Agreement. At this time, the Corporation shall ask employees if they wish to have  
their name on the roster. Only employees, who respond “Yes”, will have their names included on the roster.  
The Corporation shall request resumes from all employees who have responded “Yes.” The collected  
resumes shall be included with the roster. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to provide the  
Corporation with a resume. For a period of one (1) year following termination of employment, the  
13  
Corporation shall send copies of the current MTS position vacancies to each person on said roster. The  
mailings shall be concurrent with distribution within the Corporation of each publication of these postings.  
The Corporation shall implement procedures to ensure that persons on said roster who notify the  
Corporation in writing of their interest and suitability shall be considered along with other applicants for  
any position to be filled by the Corporation by outside hiring. No outside applicant shall be hired for a  
position as to which there is a person on said roster who has notified the Corporation of his or her interest  
and suitability unless a written explanation has been approved by the level 4 manager. It shall be the  
responsibility of persons on said roster to keep the Corporation informed of his or her address. Persons shall  
remain on said roster for a period of one (1) year, or until such person is rehired, declines an offer of rehire,  
or asks to have his or her name removed from the roster.  
626 Notification in the Event of a Reduction in Force  
627 To the Individual  
628 An employee designated to be terminated through RIF shall be given written notice in  
accordance with Paragraph 633.  
629 ToAPSA  
630 The Corporation agrees, to the extent practicable, to notify APSA in writing at least three  
(3) weeks prior to the notification of any individual of their inclusion in a RIF when the RIF 1s anticipated  
to involve five (5) or more members of the bargaining unit. There shall be no obligation to give APSA  
advance notice of the names of the individuals whose inclusion in the RIF is anticipated or to discuss with  
APSA the names of the individuals under review for possible inclusion in the RIF. In any RIF, APSA shall  
be notified in writing of the name of each member of the bargaining unit to be included in the RIF concur-  
rently with such notice to the individual. A letter of notification shall inform the individual that he/she may  
have an APSA representative present at the notification interview. Any individual to be included in the RIF  
may request the presence of an APSA representative at the notification interview.  
631 APSA agrees that the information, which it receives from the Corporation in advance of  
any anticipated RIF, shall be treated by it as confidential.  
632 Options in Event of RIF  
633 Any member of the bargaining unit whose employment is being terminated due to a RIF  
shall receive four (4) week’s written notice of his or her termination of employment. Any bargaining unit  
member designated for RIF shall have the option of receiving up to four (4) weeks’ pay in lieu of notice.  
Bargaining unit members shall receive at least one (1) week’s written notice plus three (3) weeks’ pay or a  
combination of written notice and pay in lieu of notice equaling four (4) weeks’ salary. If, in the opinion of  
the cognizant Level 6 Vice President, operational factors should require immediate termination the  
bargaining unit member shall receive four (4) weeks’ pay in lieu of notice.  
634 The Corporation shall provide for bargaining unit members who have been designated for  
RIF and who are otherwise eligible for retirement to be able to enter retirement from active employment.  
635 Corrective Action Process  
636 The Corporation has a corrective action process for managing unsatisfactory performance  
and/or unacceptable conduct by bargaining unit members. If requested by the member, an APSA  
representative shall be allowed to be present to represent the bargaining unit member in any Step 2 or 3  
14  
corrective action meeting. With or without the participation of APSA, a bargaining unit member shall be  
provided an opportunity to respond to the identified problem(s) in any corrective action meeting. A  
description of the corrective action process is provided in Appendix C, Work Environment, Section 2,  
Corrective Action.  
637 Termination for Cause  
638 The Corporation has the right to terminate for cause. The Corporation shall notify APSA  
promptly, but in any event within two (2) working days, of any termination for cause. Any employee in the  
process of being terminated for cause may request the presence of an APSA representative at the  
termination interview.  
639 Termination for cause shall include but not be limited to terminations for unsatisfactory  
performance. An employee terminated for “unsatisfactory performance” shall be given a prior written  
Corrective Action concerning his performance and a reasonable time to correct the deficiency. All such  
written Corrective Actions shall be reviewed by the Human Resources Division to consider whether  
remedial action or a remedial program is appropriate and has been recommended.  
640 Termination for cause shall also include a very limited category of discretionary  
terminations upon the authority of the President or cognizant Senior Vice President of the Corporation. Any  
such discretionary termination shall not be subject to grievance.  
641 Displaced Status  
642 Displaced status occurs when an employee’s job has been eliminated as a result of  
reorganization, has been filled during an employee’s leave of absence or has become unsuitable as a result  
of an employee’s inability to perform the primary functions of the job. APSA shall be notified, in writing,  
of the name of each member of the bargaining unit to be placed on displaced status concurrently with such  
notice to the individual.  
643 The goal of placing employees in displaced status is to provide an opportunity for the  
employee to seek a new position or work assignment. Hence, an employee in displaced status would  
normally be assigned work during the displaced period. If an employee elects to seek employment within  
the Corporation he or she may do so for a period of ninety-one (91) days. At any time during the ninety-  
one days an employee may elect to terminate employment and receive RIF notice, benefits and severance  
pay. At the end of ninety-one days in displaced status, the employee’s employment is subject to immediate  
termination. The terminating employee will receive RIF notice, benefits and severance pay. Extension of  
the ninety-one day period requires approval of the Director, Employee Relations.  
644 If temporary work assignments are unavailable, the employee may go into no-pay status  
between assignments; however, the employee is not normally subject to immediate termination of  
employment. Should a company-wide RIF occur, an employee may be subject to involuntary termination  
during the ninety-one day period in displaced status.  
645 Disability Leave - Return to Work  
646 The Corporation assists an employee’s return from Disability leave to active employment  
directly or through a rehabilitation program. The goal is to provide a reasonable time for the employee to  
find suitable work if the employee’s position has been filled or eliminated during the leave, or if the  
employee is no longer able to perform that type of work. An employee returning from temporary disability  
leave normally returns to the same organization and position. An employee may be put in displaced status  
15  
if his or her position has been eliminated or filled due to a critical need, or if the employee can no longer  
perform the primary functions of that position.  
647 An employee on temporary disability leave or Long-Term Disability (LTD) may participate  
in a rehabilitation program that allows the employee, under approved circumstances, to return to work to his  
or her previous position or similar position on a part-time basis. The employee will receive full-time  
regular benefits from the Corporation, as well as pay for hours worked, and where the employee elected  
LTD coverage, proportionally reduced disability benefits from the insurer, provided the insurer approves  
the individual’s rehabilitation program.  
648 Termination Pay  
649 Employees who voluntarily terminate employment receive no termination pay. Employees  
terminated involuntarily for reasons other than a reduction in force receive two (2) weeks’ termination pay  
if employed for six (6) months or more, or one (1) week’s pay if employed for less than six (6) months.  
Employees terminated for cause sufficient to render continued employment detrimental to the corporation’s  
interests or aS a consequence of ongoing corrective action receive neither advance notice nor termination  
pay.  
650 An employee who is terminated in a reduction in force shall receive severance pay in  
accordance with the Corporation’s severance pay policies (see Appendix E, Employee Programs, Section 9,  
Severance Pay). If a person who has been so terminated is rehired, such person shall be rehired as a new  
employee unless the rehire is within a period of one (1) year and the person rehired repays to the  
Corporation the sums he or she has received as pay in lieu of notice and severance pay to the extent such  
pay exceeds the product of the employee’s weekly wage at the time of the reduction multiplied by the  
number of weeks the employee was unemployed. Any sums so returned shall constitute the full extent of  
the severance pay available for such employee in the event of a subsequent reduction except that such  
employee shall thereafter accrue additional weeks of severance pay at the rate of one (1) week of severance  
pay for each year of subsequent employment up to a maximum total of nineteen (19) weeks.  
651 A description of the benefits associated with a reduction in force is provided in Appendix  
E, Employee Programs, Section 10, Reduction-In-Force (RIF) Benefits.  
652 MTS Pay Plan  
653 A description of the MTS salary structure is provided in Section 4 of Appendix B. The  
MTS job descriptions are provided in Section 2 of Appendix B.  
654 A copy of Appendix B, Nonsupervisory MTS, Section 4, MTS Pay Plan Structure, along  
with Practices HR—2-2 and HR-2-3, the Aerospace Professional Career Path booklet, a description of the  
MTS job role characteristics, and the MTS position code designations shall be maintained in the library, as  
well as a copy of the current salary distribution percentile curves for the non-supervisory MTS. A copy of  
the same data shall be maintained by the administrators in all regional facilities for viewing by the MTS.  
Two (2) paper copies of the same material shall be provided to APSA, along with a copy on magnetic  
media of the current salary distribution tables and percentile curves for the non-supervisory MTS.

### ARTICLE VII  
### 700 NON-DISCRIMINATION  
### 
701 The parties hereto subscribe to the principles of equal opportunity and merit employment  
and in furtherance thereof agree in accordance with the applicable state and federal laws not to discriminate  
against any employee because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, gender or gender identity, sexual  
orientation, creed, religion, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, veteran  
status, or union activity or lack thereof. Except as provided in Paragraphs 702 through 705, all complaints  
arising under this paragraph shall be processed in accord with Article XV of this Agreement.  
702 part of their commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, the Corporation and  
APSA agree that any form of sexual harassment in the workplace is improper. Complaints of sexual  
harassment shall be reported to line management, to the Diversity & Equal Employment Opportunity  
(“D&EEO”’) Office and/or to the Office of the General Counsel, and will be processed in accordance with  
Corporate Practice HR-6-4.  
703 Alleged victims and/or harassers involved in sexual harassment incidents who are members  
of the bargaining unit may seek support and assistance from APSA. An APSA representative shall be  
allowed to be present to represent the bargaining unit member in all meetings, which include the bargaining  
unit member if requested by the member. The Corporation shall advise any member of the bargaining unit  
accused of sexual harassment of the member’s right to have an APSA representative present whenever the  
member is requested to attend any meeting regarding the alleged sexual harassment.  
704 Once the investigation of an alleged sexual harassment incident has been concluded, the  
Vice President, Office of Human Resources, the General Counsel, and the Director, D&EEO Office  
recommend a course of action to the harasser’s cognizant level 6 vice president if sexual harassment is  
found to have occurred. Whether sexual harassment has or has not been found to have occurred, upon  
request the D&EEO Office shall provide a confidential written statement discussing the findings of the  
investigation to the alleged harasser and/or harassee.  
705 Either party, within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the findings and resolution, may file a  
Step 3 grievance in accordance with Paragraph 1513 of this Agreement. A second independent  
investigation may be necessary to resolve any outstanding issues. At the conclusion of the grievance, the  
Peer Review Board issues a final decision. The parties receive the final decision in writing.  

### ARTICLE VIII  
### 800 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  
### 
801 The monetary benefits specified within Article VIII, including specific referenced plans  
with regard to Group Insurance, Retirement and Voluntary Annuity, shall be continued during the term of  
this Agreement for bargaining unit employees, provided, however, that such benefits may be changed upon  
notice to and good faith bargaining in an attempt to reach such an agreement. If such bargaining produces  
an agreement, that agreement shall be reduced to writing. If no agreement is reached, after impasse the  
Company may implement the change. As additional conditions precedent to such benefit changes, two  
further provisions apply, i.e., any such reduction in benefits shall also be made applicable to supervisory  
MTS and be made for reasonable cause.  
17  
802 The provisions of the following referenced plans, as they exist at the present time, are  
described in the attached Appendices and in the Corporation’s Summary Plan Descriptions. The cost to the

plan or other descriptions to the contrary, changes in such plans to the extent that they affect the bargaining  
unit may be made during the term of this agreement only in accordance with provisions of Paragraph 801. If  
any member of the bargaining unit identifies an issue which raises an apparent conflict between the content  
of a summary plan or other description with the terms of a master policy or membership agreement, the  
Corporation and APSA shall meet in a good faith attempt to resolve the apparent conflict.

### ARTICLE XIII  
### 1300 TELECOMMUTING  
### 
1301 The Corporation has a formal telecommuting program. The Corporation § uses  
telecommuting to provide staffing flexibility and to increase productivity when an employee’s assignments  
are compatible with this method of operation. Telecommuting as part of the normal 40-unit workweek is  
voluntary, requires management approval, involves a cooperative arrangement between supervisor and  
employee, is for a specified time period, and is subject to corporate policies and practices.  
1302 Workdays and hours do not change due to participation in a telecommuting program, unless  
an alternative schedule is developed and agreed to by the employee and supervisor. Employees  
telecommuting during the normal 40-unit workweek and their supervisors will sign a Telecommuting  
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that can be terminated at any time by the Corporation or the  
employee. Bargaining unit employees are not required to sign an MOU as a condition of participating in  
the telecommuting program unless such MOU contains the following provision in a prominent location:  
21  
“A non-supervisory MTS, if he or she so chooses, may review this memorandum of understanding  
with an Aerospace Professional Staff Association (APSA) representative before signing it.”  
1303. Employees who telecommute are responsible for taking ordinary precautions in protecting  
against damage to or theft of company-owned equipment and software. Employees are not responsible for  
normal wear and tear.  

### ARTICLE XIV

sponsor any other action which would interrupt or interfere with any of the operations of the Corporation.  
1403. The employees in the bargaining unit represented by APSA, by accepting the benefits of  
this Agreement, agree that during the term of this Agreement they shall not engage in, encourage, assist or  
participate in any sit-downs, picketing, boycotts, work stoppages, sympathetic strikes or any other action  
which would interrupt or interfere with any of the operations of the Corporation.  

### ARTICLE XV  
### 1500 DISPUTES RESOLUTION  
### 
1501 Employee Grievances  
1502 In the event an employee in the bargaining unit believes that he or she has been dealt with  
unfairly with regard to any specific employment condition or any perceived violation(s) of Policy or  
Practice or a specific provision of this Agreement, such as the provisions with regard to determination of  
performance, salary level or adjustment, discrimination, grievable termination for cause involving whether  
an employee's job performance is acceptable to the Corporation, termination under a RIF, or a transfer, the  
subject employee with or without the assistance of APSA is encouraged to discuss his or her dissatisfaction  
with line supervision up to and including the Division or Operations General Manager, as appropriate, in an  
effort to resolve the matter.  
1503 In addition, the employee has the option of seeking advice and assistance with regard to his  
or her dissatisfaction from the Employee Relations Department or from APSA.  
22  
1504 Step 1 Grievance Resolution  
1505 Within twenty (20) working days of the event giving rise thereto, the employee shall  
initiate the discussion of his or her dissatisfaction  
1506 Within twenty (20) working days after the employee has brought the matter to supervision's  
attention, line supervision up to and including the Division or Operations General Manager shall attempt to  
resolve the matter.  
1507 The employee or the employee’s supervision may request the presence of a member of the  
Human Resources Division, Employee Relations Department, at such discussions, whether or not APSA is  
assisting. The Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator and APSA representative shall meet  
before the meeting to coordinate the meeting process. An employee may secure the assistance of APSA at  
any stage of the processing of a grievance, provided, however, any agreements, schedules or conditions  
established prior to APSA’s entry shall not be altered. If APSA is involved, the Employee Relations/Labor  
Relations Administrator will act as a facilitator and management advocate. If APSA is uninvolved, the  
Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator will act as a facilitator and mediator for corporate  
management and the grievant.  
1508 Step 2 Grievance Resolution  
1509 ten (10) working days of receipt of the final decision of the Division or Operations  
General Manager or within twenty (20) working days of the expiration of the twenty (20) working day  
period referred to above, whichever occurs first, if the matter remains unresolved or if the employee  
remains dissatisfied, the employee may file a formal written grievance with the Employee Relations  
Department outlining the nature of the grievance and the remedy requested. This formal grievance may be  
filed with or without the assistance of APSA; however, the procedures outlined in this Agreement will be  
followed in either case. If the grievance is filed with APSA, APSA shall assist in submitting the written  
grievance outlining the nature of the grievance and the remedy requested to the Employee Relations/Labor  
Relations Administrator.  
1510 Within twenty (20) working days, the Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator  
shall attempt to resolve the matter by conferring with the appropriate Division or Operations General  
Manager or his or her designee and with the grieving employee in the case of a grievance filed without the  
assistance of APSA, or with the employee and APSA in the case of a grievance filed with the assistance of  
APSA.  
1511 Unless waived by the parties, this resolution attempt shall be in the form of a meeting with  
the employee, Division/Operations General Manager, line supervision, Employee Relations/Labor Relations  
Administrator and the APSA representative. —The Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator and  
APSA representative shall meet before the meeting to coordinate the meeting process. In a grievance filed  
without the assistance of APSA and unless waived by the parties, the resolution attempt shall be in the form  
of a meeting with the employee, Division/Operations General Manager, line supervision, and the Employee  
Relations/Labor Relations Administrator. The meeting shall be chaired by the General Manager.  
1512 Independent of APSA’s participation, the employee shall receive a written response from  
management.  
1513. Step 3 Grievance Resolution  
23  
1514 Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of management’s written response and if the  
matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the employee, it shall be referred for a fair hearing and  
determination by a Peer Review Board.  
1515 The Peer Review Board shall consist of five (5) voting members: a Level 5 or 6 Vice  
President (technical) selected by the Vice President, Office of Human Resources; a Level 4 or above  
Manager (technical) selected by the Principal Director, Human Resources; and three (3) bargaining unit  
employees selected randomly from a pool of employee peers. None of these five individuals shall be from  
the grievant’s organization or the defending organization. To the extent possible, none of the five  
individuals shall be from the same organization. The Vice President shall chair the Peer Review Board  
hearing.  
1516 The peer pool shall consist of approximately fifty-two (52) bargaining unit employees.  
Level 5 management will select two (2) individuals from their area. In organizations consisting of twenty-  
five (25) or more bargaining unit employees with no Level 5 management, one (1) individual will be  
selected by Level 6 management. Individuals are selected for a period of up to two (2) years, except that  
for the first year sixteen (16) individuals shall serve for a period of one (1) year. Any time spent in this  
activity by bargaining unit employees shall not have to be made up.  
1517 The grievant may be accompanied in the hearing by an APSA representative or any other  
peer of the grievant's choice. The Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator and APSA  
representative shall met before the hearing to coordinate the hearing process. Non-employees may not act  
in this capacity. Members of corporate management may be assisted by an Employee Relations/Labor  
Relations Administrator. If APSA is uninvolved, the Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator  
will act as a facilitator and mediator for corporate management and the grievant.  
1518 Additional individuals present in the hearing are limited to two recorders (one selected by  
the grievant and the other selected by the Employee Relations/Labor Relations Administrator), and  
additional observers agreed upon by APSA and Employee Relations/Labor Relations. These individuals are  
restricted to the roles of non-participating observers.  
1519 The decision of the Peer Review Board shall be final and binding on all parties. Individuals  
other than the Board members are precluded from participating in the deliberations. An Employee  
Relations/Labor Relations Administrator shall be present as a recorder. Within twenty (20) working days of  
the hearing, the Peer Review Board shall submit a written decision to the cognizant Level 6 Vice President.  
Within another five (5) working days, the cognizant Level 6 Vice President shall submit the written  
decision to the grievant and participants.  
1520 Termination-Related Grievances  
1521 To the extent practicable, termination-related grievances shall proceed in such a way that  
the following goals may be achieved: (a) Within twenty (20) working days of receipt of termination  
notification, the employee shall begin the grievance process at Step 2 by filing a formal written grievance  
outlining the nature of the grievance and the remedy requested; and (b) The hearing before the Peer Review  
Board shall be held within forty (40) working days of receipt of the grievance.  
1522 Timeliness

1524 Other Conditions  
1525. The Chair of APSA Grievance Committee and the Labor Relations Administrator or  
designee will meet at least once each month to review the status of pending grievances in an effort to  
expedite their resolution.  
1526 No reprisals or retaliation shall be taken against any employee because of the employee's  
resort to the procedure set forth herein.  
1527 Employees, including one (1) APSA representative in case of a grievance filed with the  
assistance of APSA, whose participation in a meeting with the Corporation after the filing of the written  
grievance with the Human Resources Division is required to effectuate the purpose of this provision, shall  
not be required to take unpaid leave or to make up the time spent in any such meeting.  
1528 APSA Grievances and Arbitration  
1529 APSA itself may present grievances on matters that involve the rights of APSA itself  
specifically set forth in this Agreement in Article I (Paragraph 106 only), III, IV, and VI (Paragraphs 613  
and 630 only) and VII (union activity only). Additionally, APSA may invoke the provisions of this  
paragraph for presentation of a grievance involving termination for cause of a bargaining unit member  
where termination does not involve whether the employee’s job performance is acceptable to the  
Corporation, and the terminated employee has filed a written grievance with the Vice President, Office of  
Human Resources or the Vice President’s designee within nine (9) working days of his or her discharge.  
1530 Any such grievance shall be filed by APSA in writing with the Vice President, Office of  
Human Resources or the Vice President’s designee within twenty (20) days of the event giving rise to the  
grievance except as specified in Paragraph 1529 above.  
1531 In the event the Office of Human Resources is unable to resolve the matter to the  
satisfaction of the parties, APSA may refer the matter to arbitration, provided that in the case of a dispute  
concerning an employee’s discharge as specified in Paragraph 1529 above, the referral to arbitration must  
be accompanied by a written demand for arbitration from the discharged employee.  
1532 Unless such referral is made within fifteen (15) days of the written response of the Office  
of Human Resources, the written response of the Office of Human Resources shall be final and binding  
upon all parties, including the employee(s).  
1533 In the event of a timely referral to arbitration, after the exhaustion of Paragraphs 1529  
through 1531 of the grievance procedure, the parties shall select an arbitrator within an additional period of  
ten (10) working days of such a referral to arbitration.  
1534 If the Corporation and APSA are unable to agree upon the selection of an impartial  
arbitrator within such ten (10) working days, they shall then jointly in writing request the American  
Arbitration Association to submit a panel of seven (7) names of persons residing in Southern California.  
APSA and the Corporation shall alternately strike names from said panel until there is only one (1) name  
remaining and such remaining person shall be the impartial arbitrator. If such person selected is not  
available within a mutually acceptable time, the parties shall request a new panel and repeat the procedure  
described in this paragraph. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both the  
Corporation and APSA as to all matters of dispute arising under Paragraph 1529 of this Article provided,  
25  
however, that the arbitrator shall have no power to add to or subtract from or to change, alter, or modify any  
of the terms of this Agreement.  
1535 All fees and expenses of the arbitration proceeding shall be shared equally between the  
parties hereto. Each party shall be responsible for all other expenses incurred by it in the presentation of its  
case, including the compensation and expenses of an employee called by it as a witness or representing or  
acting on its behalf. The cost of a transcript shall be shared equally when both parties order a copy. Any  
employee called as a witness by APSA or acting on behalf of APSA during the arbitration shall be given  
time off without pay to participate in the arbitration. In the event an employee’s work assignment is such  
that he or she cannot be released to participate as a necessary witness, the arbitration shall be continued or  
rescheduled to permit such employee to testify
