Clerks) - These employees and their eligible dependents are eligible to par-  
ticipate in the medical, dental care, vision care, physical pre-  
scription drug and life and dismemberment insurance plans the first of the  
month following three months of service — assuming al! other eligibility  
criteria are satisfied.  
Part-Time Employees (Excluding Part-Time and Service  
Clerks) are eligible — for single coverage only — to participate in the  
vision care, physical exam and life and dismemberment plans as of the first  
of the month following six months of service: a prescription drug plan as

plan as of the first of the month following twenty-four months of service;  
and a medical plan (a reimbursement plan only, all other plans paying pri-  
mary) as of the first of the month following twenty-four months of service  
if the 1,000 hour work criteria (during the 12 month period commencing  
on October | and ending on September 30) is met. The employee is also  
covered, if s/he satisfies the twenty four month criteria, but works less than  
1,000 hours but more than 750 hours in the applicable period, with his/her  
ratio of hours worked divided by the number of months worked equaling  
at least 85. Otherwise, the first 120 (one hundred and twenty) days of hos-

in by reference and made a part hereof. Copies of the Plan Document are  
available at the Fund Office, 1389 Broad Street, Clifton, New Jersey

Contributions  
The Fixed Contribution is made for full-time employees eligi-  
ble for benefits as of the first of the month following three (3)  
months of employment and for part-time employees as of the  
first of the month following one (1) year of employment.  
The Variable Contribution shall be made for all employees eli-  
gible for benefits. The Fixed Contribution will be made month-  
ly for all eligible full-time and part-time employees who are  
active as of the first (1st) of the month or for those imactive as  
provided for in the Eligibility and Coverage sections of this  
Article, Section (d), subsection (1) through (12).  
To the extent that any Employer Health and Welfare contribu-  
tions lose their status as fully tax deductible for the Employer  
(or other tax law changes), the Employer and the Union will  
meet and implement changes that will allow the Employer to  
continue to pay for benefits at the same after tax cost (after the  
tax law change is taken into consideration) as before the tax  
changes. This is not intended to create a windfall to the  
Employer, but is intended to prevent any additional cost to the  
Employer. It is intended to allow the parties, with no addition-  
a! after tax cost to the Employer, to utilize the funds available in  
order to maintain Employer benefits as close to the ievel that  
existed prior to the new tax structure. The specific eligibility  
and coverage provisions are set forth in the Plan Document.

points of eligibility and coverage are set forth in Section (d)

Pension Fund.  
Coverage and Eligibility  
Coverage for all benefit plans begins on the first of the month  
following the applicable eligibility period, as Jong as the  
employee is actively at work on that date and has been actively  
employed during this period. An employee will be considered  
actively at work if s/he is performing in the customary manner  
all the regular duties of employment. Active employment shall  
also include me for which an employee is not performing reg-  
ular duties but is paid, such as vacation days, sick days, jury  
duty and bereavement time. I[f an employee is not actively at  
work on the date the employee’s coverage would become effec-  
tive, provided the requisite eligibility period had been satisfied,  
then the employee becomes eligible on the first day following  
his/her return to active employment.  
For full-time employees only, (excluding Full-Time Service  
Clerks and Porters) coverage is provided for eligible dependents.  
Eligible dependents include: a legally married spouse; unmar-  
ried children under age 19; unmarried children who are full-time  
students under the age of 23; and, an unmamed child over age  
19 who may be mentally or physically handicapped and depend-  
ent upon the employee for support, so long as the incapacity  
commenced prior to age 19 (or 23 if a full-time student).  
Eligible dependents (where applicable) become eligible on the  
same date the employee becomes eligible provided that they are  
not hospitalized or otherwise not in active service on that date.  
Dependents must also be in “active service” in order for their  
coverage to begin. This means that they must engage in all of  
the normal activities of people in good health of similar age and  
21  
gender. If dependents are hospitalized or not in active service on  
the date the employee's coverage becomes effective, they would  
then become eligible on the first day following their discharge  
from the hospital or return to active service.  
In the event of an intra-Company transfer of an employee cov-  
ered under a collective bargaining agreement with another  
United Food and Commercial Workers local and eligible for  
welfare benefits under that agreement, the employee shall be  
covered for welfare benefits hereunder.  
The waiting period shall be waived when hiring employees cur-  
rently eligible and covered by ShopRite, Foodtown, Stop &  
Shop or Grand Union contracts with Local 1262 providing this  
employment takes place within thirty (30) days. Fixed contri-  
butions will commence on the first of the month following hire.  
Coverage for all employees shall continue for up to three  
months during absence from work due to compensable or non-  
compensable injury or illness.  
Full-time employees with five (5) or more years of service who  
are laid-off shall continue to be covered for Health and Welfare  
for three (3) calendar months following the date of layoff,  
unless they are otherwise employed and eligible for benefits.  
For part-time employees reclassified to full-time, full-time  
Fixed Contributions will commence on the first of the month  
following reclassification. For employees reclassified to full-  
time who were not eligible for part-time coverage, 50% credit  
will be given for part-time service toward the full-time waiting  
period. Full credit will be given to employees converting from  
full-time to part-time who were not eligible for full-time cover-  
age.  
Full-time employees (with full-time coverage) involuntarily  
reduced to part-time shall continue full-time coverage for three  
months following the reduction. The first of the month there-  
after, applicable part-lime coverage will commence. The appli-  
cable part-time fixed contributions and coverage will com-  
mence on the first of the month following voluntary change  
from full-time to part-time for employees eligible for full-time  
coverage.  
Coverage will commence following re-employment of an eligi-  
ble employee who leaves employment lo enter the military serv-  
ice of the United States and who is entitled to re-employment  
under the applicable laws of the United States.  
Coverage shall be resumed on the first of the month following  
the return to work on the Employer's active payroll after illness,  
injury, teave of absence or recall from layoff providing the per-  
son is otherwise eligible for coverage and the coverage had  
been previously discontinued.  
Coverage will cease as of the last day of work for employees  
who quit, are terminated for cause or who are otherwise not  
actively at work and who do not have extended coverage as oth-  
erwise provided for herein. Coverage will cease as of the last  
day coincident with the extension of coverage provided for an  
approved leave of absence, layoff or absence due to compensa-  
ble or non-compensable injury or illness.  
Those full-time employees who retire on or after April 10, 1993

IV Retirees. Full-time employees who retire on or after January  
1, 1994 are considered Group V Retirees. Specific eligibility  
and coverage provisions for each class of retirees are set forth  
in the Plan Document.
