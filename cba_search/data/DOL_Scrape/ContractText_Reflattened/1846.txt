principal agreement, or terminated. For the purpose of negotiating alterations in wages and other terms  
and conditions of employment, either party may open this Agreement or any contract effectuated through  
automatic renewal by giving written “Notice of Opening” no later than sixty (60) nor more than ninety  
(90) days prior to the expiration date. “Notice of Opening” is no way intended by the parties as a  
termination of, nor shall it in anyway be construed as, a termination of this Agreement or any annual  
contract effectuated through automatic renewal nor as forestalling automatic renewal as herein provided.  
The parties reserve the right to economic recourse in negotiations, except during the interval between the  
giving of “Notice of Opening” and the expiration date.
