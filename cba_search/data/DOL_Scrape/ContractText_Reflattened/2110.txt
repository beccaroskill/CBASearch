Employer in writing of any changes to these amounts. Union authorization cards must be submitted  
prior to the fifteenth (15") of the month proceeding the date that deductions are to be made.

care provided that such activities have been approved by the Employee’s supervisor. Long  
distance telephone calls shall not be made at Government or Company expense.

at their required times. It shall constitute an offense for an employee to be absent from  
work or late reporting to work without prior authorization.  
Employees shall provide as much advance notice as possible of an absence or  
tardiness. In no case shall such notice be given less than six (6) hours in advance. Failure  
to provide at least six (6) hours’ notice to the Command Center or the Supervisor in advance  
will result in skipping of a step in the progression of discipline described below. A  
complete failure to provide notice, to respond to calls, or to appear — a “no call, no show”  
— shall be cause for discipline up to and including termination.  
Each unauthorized absence or late reporting for work will result in the following  
disciplinary progression, unless the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that  
mitigating circumstances rendered the event beyond the employee’s control.  
With respect to the first absence or late reporting within any consecutive 12 month  
period, counseling shall be given.  
With respect to the second absence or late reporting within any consecutive 12  
month period, a verbal reprimand will be given.  
With respect to the third absence or late reporting within any consecutive 12 month  
period, a written reprimand will be given.  
With respect to the fourth absence or late reporting within any consecutive 12  
month period, a one-day suspension will be given.  
With respect to the fifth absence or late reporting within any consecutive 12 month  
period, a three-day suspension will be given.  
With respect to a sixth absence or late reporting within any consecutive |2-month  
period, the employee will be terminated.  
Page 16 of 26  
It is expressly agreed and understood between the parties that this is a “strict  
liability” absentee policy.  
All disciplinary records shall be removed and expunged from the employee’s  
file after one (1) year, except those showing (a) harassment; (b) threats or violence;  
(c) insubordination; or (d) a pattern of misconduct.

Section 12.4 Standards of Conduct. It is acknowledged and recognized that the  
Company is in the business of providing security services to the United States Government,  
and that the provision of these services is highly sensitive. It is therefore essential and  
expected by the Company and Union that all employees shall act in a highly professional,  
courteous manner and shall be held responsible for their duties, functions and job  
requirements. Deviation from or failure to meet this standard shall constitute just cause  
and result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. It is expressly agreed and  
understood that the issuance of a 2820 by the Government shall constitute prima facie  
evidence of failure to meet this standard and shall constitute just cause for discipline.
