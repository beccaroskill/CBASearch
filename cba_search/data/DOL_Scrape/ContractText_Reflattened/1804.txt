wa  
Effective December 1, 2006, for employees employed as of November 21, 2006, the  
Company will “contribute” $10.00 per week, and $10.00 per week will be withheld from such  
employee’s pay. The combined $20.00 will be considered to be banked into an “escrow fund”  
until the point in time where the “fund” is equal to one (1) week’s pay for that  
employee. At that point in time, the employee’s pay will change-over to the above “paid for  
the previous week’s work” payroll method, and the employee will receive the full amount of  
the “escrow fund”. Thereby, the “escrow fund” pay(check) will serve as the change-over-  
paycheck to the new payroll timetable. In the event an employee covered by this change-  
over procedure should quit or be terminated for just cause prior to receipt of the full change-  
over payment, that employee would only receive his/her withheld monies held in the escrow  
fund; such employee would not be eligible to receive the $10.00 per week Company  
contributions to the fund.

(excluding travel allowance); provided, however, such Employer reimbursement shall not be  
applicable to any period of time during which said employee-juryman did not perform work for  
the Employer other than when prevented from doing so solely because of said jury service;  
and further provided that such Employer reimbursement is, in no event, to be applicable for a

### HEALTH AND WELFARE AND DENTAL PLAN  
### 
A. Effective November 1, 2003, the Company will provide health and dental benefits under  
Great West Life (health), Met Life (dental), and Vision Services (vision).  
B. Maintenance of Benefits: The employee's cost share of the benefits of paragraph A shall  
be as follows:  
Employee only - 10.9%  
(Employee + Spouse) or (Employee + Child) - 16.3%  
(Employee + Spouse + Child(ren)) or (Employee + Children) - 17.4%  
C. The Employer's obligation to provide coverage for an employee under the above Plans  
shall cease on the last day of the month in which the employment termination occurs. If an  
employee ceases to be actively at work because of accident or illness, the Employer will  
keep the coverage in force for a period not to exceed four (4) months.  
D. The Company will provide a “Plan-125” type benefit for the purpose of allowing  
employees who so elect to pay with pre-tax monies the employee's share of the cost for  
health and dental benefits under Article XVI. Participation in Plan 125 is voluntary. The  
Company will pay the administrative costs for the pre-tax payment of the employee's share of  
the costs of Article XVI benefits.  
E. Itis the intention of the Employer to maintain coverage that is essentially equal to the  
coverage in effect on December 1, 2003. However, the parties also recognize the probability  
of increases in the cost of benefits and are desirous of controlling costs to the greatest extent  
possible. The parties recognize that benefit coverage such as deductibles, co-pays, out-of-  
pocket-maximums, and/or co-insurance-percentages may need to be increased/decreased.  
Therefore, the Employer shall have the ability to “shop” for benefit coverage (the entirety of  
the health and dental benefits) that provides the greatest cost/benefit, consistent with the  
intent of all of the foregoing. In the event of a change in the health and/or dental coverage,  
unit employees will have the identical coverage as the General Manager, and the Union will  
be notified in advance of the change and provided with a copy of the new benefit coverage.
