satisfactory performance of work by an employee and may  
discharge any employee whose work is unsatisfactory or who  
fails to observe the safety precautions or other rules and  
regulations prescribed by the Employer for the health, safety  
and protection of his employees. However, no employee shall  
be discharged for defending the rights of any employee under

point a Steward whenever possible from Operating Engineers  
working on the job and the Union District Repre-  
sentative will, when making such an appointment, notify the  
Employer. The Steward shall perform full-time work for the  
Employer and he/she shall be subject to the same rules, rights  
and working conditions as other employees. Under no circum-  
stances shall the Steward have any authority to call a strike,  
stowdown of work or perform any other action which would be  
in violation of this Agreement.  
25. The Employer agrees that each new employee shall  
report to the job Steward before starting work if a Steward has  
been appointed for that particular Employer's job. The Steward  
shall be allowed sufficient time during working hours to perform  
all normal duties required of a Steward. No Steward shall have  
job priority but will be laid off in the same manner as any other  
Operating Engineer upon completion of his/her particular job  
assignment; twenty-four {24} hour notice to the Union prior to  
his/her lay off is required to give the Union time to select  
another qualified Steward to replace the laid-off Steward, but  
this twenty-four (24) hour notice is not required when a Stew-  
ard is discharged for cause by the Employer.

tions until satisfactory results are obtained.  
TRAINING  
27. The Safety Training Passport 16-hour program will  
be made available to all union members by the Union at no cost  
to the Employer. The program will consist of:  
Safety Awareness as required by  
OSHA 29CFR 1926.21  
Fall Protection as required by OSHA  
29CFR 1926.503  
Hazard Communication as required by  
OSHA 29CFR 1926.59

dangerous atmospheres are present so that an Operator is  
required to don a special protective suit and/or self-contained  
breathing apparatus at a private, state, federal or other desig-  
nated toxic/hazardous waste site, the Employer will notify the  
Union district office. Reasonable dress-up time and clean-up  
time will be allowed. The first qualified bargaining unit em-  
ployee on the job willbe designated the steward-safety person,  
who shall have access to company monitoring records and be  
kept informed of amounts of contaminants on the job site. A  
10  
sheltered “safe zone” area shall be provided. There shall be  
wash-up facilities on all toxic/nazardous waste sites. When  
hazmat training credentials are required, the Operator will  
receive a $.50 per hour premium added to his/her base rate.  
On such projects, it is expressly understood that if the  
employees’ immediate health and safety are in danger, the  
employee may discontinue operations, without penalty, until  
satisfactory results are obtained, or until such time as a recog-  
nized safety agent shall declare the equipment or operation to  
be safe. Ail Operating Engineers employees shall be advised  
by the Employer prior to employment as to the nature of the  
known hazardous waste and possible resultant physical  
injuries as may be required by applicable law.  
30. DRUG TESTING: The Employer and the Union are  
committed to a policy that promotes safety in the work place,  
employes health, and well being. In consideration of this policy,  
the Union and Employer agree that any employee found to be  
under the influence of, in possession of, or engaged in the  
distribution of drugs or alcohol on the job site shall be subject to  
disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.  
Within two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new  
Operator may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a  
prescription drug which may impair mental or motor function  
shall inform their supervisor in writing of such drug use.  
Employee involvement with drugs and alcohol can  
adversely affect job performance and employee morale. Inthe  
Construction Industry the consequences of drug or alcohol use  
or influence while on the job site can be disastrous. The  
Employer and Union, therefore, agree to the following policy to  
insure all employees of a safe and efficient job site free fromthe  
effects of drug and alcohol use or influence.  
All job sites or work areas are subject to random or  
massive drug screening. Any employee who is involved in an  
on-the-job accident resulting in an injury to aperson or property  
or whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion of  
probable cause of illegal drug or alcohol use impairment while  
on the job site, may be required as a condition of continued  
employment to submit to a test for alcoho! and/or illegal drug  
use which impairs the employee's ability to safely perform  
his/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a  
sampling of the employee’s blood, urine, or breath. Any em-  
1  
ployee who is asked to submit to such a test will be required to  
sign a consent form. If an employee who is asked to submit to  
a test refuses to do so, or refuses to sign the necessary consent  
form, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to  
and including discharge. Refusal to take a test or the submis-  
sion of an adulterated sample shall be determined the same as  
@ positive test result. The employee/member shall follow all  
requirements outlined in this section.  
All testing will be done by a reliable, established labora-  
tory. If this initial test screen result indicates positive findings,  
further testing of the same sample must be done to confirm the  
original findings before the laboratory can report a positive  
finding. The confirmation test will be conducted by an indepen-  
dent accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of  
American Pathology Laboratory and will utilize the more scien-  
tific Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry examination  
(GC/MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential  
between the employee, the Employer and the Union. The  
employee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wage and fringes  
for time required for drug testing provided results are negative.  
If the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee may  
be granted a leave of absence for the purposes of drug and  
alcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible such rehabili-  
tation programs are covered under the Ohio Operating  
Engineers Health and Welfare Program providing the em-  
ployee confines his/her self to a twenty-four (24) hour licensed  
rehabilitation medical facility.  
Until the employee presents certification of successful  
completion of the rehabilitation program, he/she shall be re-  
moved from the Employer's job site; shall be prohibited from  
registering under Article [Il of the referral of this contract and  
shall not be dispatched to work. Upon presentation of certifica-  
tion of the employee’s successful completion of the drug/alcohol  
rehabilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her  
original job with the Employer. If the employee is not restored to  
their original job, the employee will be allowed to register for work  
in the referral by registering a new work referral card. The  
employee shall, under either circumstance, for the next suc-  
ceeding twelve (12) month period, present to the District Repre-  
sentative monthly certification of negative drug/alcohol test re-  
sults. Failure to do so will result in denying the employee the right  
12  
to maintain his/her referral card in the register and utilize the  
referral or if working, to be removed from work.  
31. Harassment Policy: The parties to this Agreement  
mutually agree that harassment of any nature is not to be  
tolerated. Every person working under this Agreement shall  
immediately notify the Employer when a possibility of a prob-  
lem happens or exists.

32. Local 18 and its Branches, shall maintain registers  
of all applicants for referral. Applicants shall not be permitted to  
be registered in more than one office of the Union at any one  
time. All applicants will be registered in order of application,  
provided no person shall be deemed to be an applicant who is  
otherwise gainfully employed as an Operating Engineer or not  
immediately available for work. Registrations and re-registra-  
tions will be accepted during customary business hours. Appli-  
cants shall be classified in priority groups in accordance with  
the following criteria:  
GROUP A: All applicants who have worked as Operating  
Engineers at least 360 days, 90 days or more per year during  
the last four (4) years, and have been employed for at least 360  
days, 90 days or more per year during the last four (4) years on  
work as defined in Article | of this Agreement within the geo-  
graphical jurisdiction of Local 18, and who have lived in the  
State of Ohio, or in any county contiguous thereto, for at least  
one (1) year prior to application.  
GROUP A PREFERRED: Must have Group A eligibility.  
Group A registrants may voluntarily register in the Group A  
Preferred, however, registrants in this Preferred A status shall  
have at least fifteen (15) years employment or availability for  
employment in any one or more of the classifications contained  
in this Agreement and in the type or kind of craft work covered  
by this Agreement in the geographic area as defined by this  
Agreement. Referral in this group is limited to the following  
described equipment and wiil be given priority of referral from  
the Group A Preferred deck. Preferred A status employees will  
not be eligible for letter of request by the Employer: Welding  
Machines, Elevator, Conveyor, Pumps, Compressors, Gen-  
13  
erators, One Drum Hoist, Mono-Rail Hoist and Portable Heat-  
ers.  
it is further understood and agreed that when the  
Employer employs Operating Engineers not currently in their  
employ for any machines listed in this section, the Employer  
shail call the referral office servicing his/her job or project and  
request that an employee qualifying under the Preferred A  
Status be dispatched to service and operate said machine. Any  
Operating Engineer currently employed by an Employer can be  
used to operate any of the above listed machines. Apprentices  
shall not operate this equipment more than fifteen (15) days.  
Workmen registering in this Preferred A Group shall be  
ineligible to register in any other group and shall not work in any  
classification other than those specified in this section and only  
have recall rights for equipment specified in this section.  
GROUP A RETIREES: Must have Group A eligibility. The  
pension was set up to enhance the lives of retirees in their golden  
years. Retiring from the trades is by voluntary choice.  
A retiree is an equipment operator or mechanic who has  
applied for and is receiving a pension from any construction  
industry source.  
Upon retirement the retiree can onty register in this group.  
The Group A retirees will be referred to jobs only after the  
Group A classification and the Preferred A classification have  
been exhausted.  
The Group A retirees will not be eligible for letter of  
request by the Employer.  
GROUP B: Same as Group A, except that the employ-  
ment shall have been at least 270 days, three (3) years of 90  
days each. All fourth year Apprentices and Trainees shall be  
registered in this group.  
GROUP C: All applicants who have worked as Operating  
Engineers at least ninety (90) days per year during each of the  
last two (2) years, and who have lived in the State of Ohio or any  
county contiguous thereto for at least one (1) year prior to  
application. All third year Apprentices and Trainees shall be  
registered in this group.  
GROUP D: All applicants who have worked as Operating  
Engineers at least ninety (90) days during the twelve (12)  
months prior to application. All second year Apprentices and  
Trainees shall be registered in this group.  
14  
GROUP E: All other applicants and all first year Appren-  
tices and Trainees shall be registered in this group.  
GROUP F: Ail applicants who are “temporary employees.”  
All applicants who have attained eligibility in any of the  
foregoing groups shail not lose eligibility as a result of their  
failure to obtain the required days of employment during the  
applicable periods of time. All graduating Apprentices shall  
upon journeymen certification become eligible for Group A.  
When an applicant fails to register in his/her eligibility group  
due to reasons other than illness, as hereinafter defined, and  
does not notify the Union Hall, the resultant failure to obtain the  
required days of employment during the applicable periods of  
time shall cause the applicant to lose eligibility in that group.  
Any registrant requesting that their work registration card  
be placed on hold due to sickness or ill health must present to  
the Union a doctor’s certificate or statement certifying that the  
registrant will be under a doctor’s care for a minimum of thirty  
(30) days, and that such illness prevents the registered appli-  
cant from working as an Operating Engineer. A work  
card will only be placed on hold for a minimum  
period of thirty (30) days, and a maximum period of one  
hundred twenty (120) days. No registration cards willbe placed  
in the hold position for illness less than a thirty (30) day  
duration. Any refusals of dispatches due to illness for a period  
of less than thirty (30) days shall be counted as a refusal under  
the terms and conditions of the referral procedure.  
33. Inreferring applicants, the following procedure shall  
be followed:  
A. Applicants in Group A shall first be referred, and then  
Group A Preferred, then Group A Retirees, then applicants in  
the succeeding groups, in order, through Group E. In each  
group, the Union shall refer applicants in order of their places  
on the referral list.  
B. Registered Apprentices or Trainees shall be referred  
in order of their position on the referral tist.  
C. Employers shall have the right to reject any applicant  
referred for employment and shall immediately notify the Union  
in writing of such rejection. In the event a registrant is dis-  
charged by the Employer because of lack of sufficient ability,  
15  
and he/she does not exercise his/her rights under the Referral  
Board of Review and Arbitration under Paragraph 37, the  
classification or equipment from which he/she is discharged  
shall be stricken from his/her referral record and he/she shall  
not be dispatched to a job in that classification or on that  
equipment until he/she has:  
1. Taken training at his/her training site and has been  
certified, or  
2. Has presented to his/her dispatch office a letter from  
a previous Employer, in signed agreement with Local 18 work-  
ing within Local 18’s jurisdiction, stating that in the  
opinion the discharged registrant has successfully completed  
a job assignment in that classification or on that piece of  
equipment in his employment.  
D. actually employed, he/she shall  
notify the Union office at which he/she is registered within  
twenty-four (24) hours. Fatlure to do so is an imposition upon  
those registered and not employed and, therefore, such appli-  
cant will be barred from re-registering, unless and until he/she  
has made application to the Board of Review and Arbitration  
provided for in Paragraph 37 of this Agreement, and shows  
good cause for his/her failure to give such notice.  
F. When an applicant becomes employed, his/her  
name shall be removed from the register as soon as he/she  
shall have worked for a total of thirty-one (31) accumulative  
working days (one (1) day jobs shall not count). An Operator  
who relieves another Operator will not be charged for the first  
fifteen (15) days (only one (1) fifteen (15) day relief per registra-  
tion application card). All days after that will be counted toward  
his/her time.  
lf an applicant is employed for less than thirty-one (31)  
accumulative working days, he/she shall be restored to his/her  
previous position on the register when such employment termi-  
nates. Any applicant who quits employment or fails to show up  
for work assignment at starting time after being dispatched  
(provided he/she was dispatched the previous day), for what-  
ever reason, except accident verified by police report, shall be  
placed at the bottom of the applicable registration group re-  
gardless of the number of days worked and shall not be eligible  
16  
for request until he/she puts in a new registration card. When  
reason for employment termination is questioned, applicant  
must present a written termination slip evidencing reasons  
other than a voluntary quit before he/she is restored to his/her  
previous position on the register.  
An applicant for employment may not refuse referral to  
employment for any reason except that the applicant may  
inform the District Office in writing, before any referral, that he/  
she will not accept employment referrals in certain named  
counties within the District. If an applicant refuses a job referral  
for the second consecutive time, he/she shail lose his/her  
position on the register and go to the bottom of the list for his/  
her group.” If the dispatcher is unable to contact an applicant,  
the failure to contact shall not be deemed to be a refusal.  
F. Applicants must notify the Union office in which they  
are registered by telephone, or letter, or telegram, or in person  
of their continued availability for employment within thirty (30)  
days after the date of last registration or re-registration in order  
to maintain their places on the register.  
In order to equally distribute and defray the cost of ser-  
vices rendered by the use of this referral system, all individuats  
who make use of this referral system shall be required to pay an  
initial registration fee of $16.75 and another $16.75 for each re-  
registration thereafter, provided that such fee shall not exceed  
$16.75 in any consecutive thirty (30) day period (the aforestated  
$16.75 will increase to $17.25 effective July 1, 2005) and  
provided that such fee shall not apply to the following:  
1. Members in good standing of Local 18 or its Branches,  
International Union of Operating Engineers, whose proportionate  
share of the cost of this referral system is met by their regular dues; and  
2. Applicants for membership to Local 18 or its Branches,  
International Union of Operating Engineers, whose proportionate  
share of the cost of this referral system is met by their fees; and  
3. Members in good standing of the International Union  
of Operating Engineers who are paying trave! dues whose  
proportionate share of the cost of this referral system is met by  
the payment of their fees.  
"Does not apply to the Ohio or Kentucky Building & Light Commercial  
Agreements Referral.  
17  
G. shall use its best efforts to notify all registered  
applicants when work is available for them, but the Union assumes  
no responsibility or obligation for failure to locate an applicant.  
H. All applicants must submit a written resume of their  
experience and qualifications at the time of original registra-  
tions, and may be tested on the equipment they operate at the  
nearest available training site prior to being assigned a posi-  
tion on the referral list.  
|. Subject to this referral system Employers may hire  
through this referral policy, by name, former employees who  
have resided for at least twenty-four (24} months in the State  
of Ohio or in any county contiguous thereto, and have been  
employed by the Employer making the request during the past  
twenty-four (24) months within the jurisdiction of this Agree-  
ment. The Employer must make the request to the appropriate  
Union District Office and the employee requested must be  
registered on the District referral jist (Groups A through E).  
Employers may hire through this referral policy by name  
individuals in Group A for a production machine, or for a  
mechanic, or mechanic/welder, who has been registered on  
the out-of-work list for at least ten (10) days in the District in  
which the work is to be performed. Individuals shall have only  
one (1) request per four (4) month period from the last request.  
The request by name must be confirmed later in writing on the  
letterhead of the Employer and signed by either the Employer  
or the superintendent of the project.  
Nothing in the referral procedure shall interfere with the  
transfer of an Employer's employees on his payroll from one  
project to another project within the geographical area covered  
by Local 18. When transferring employees, the Employer will  
notify the Union District Office from which the employee is to be  
transferred.  
The Union agrees the transfer will be processed in an  
expedient manner.  
J. The purpose of the referral system is to provide nondis-  
criminatory employment opportunities. Individuals who register  
therein deserve a preference over those who do not. Therefore, it  
is agreed that in the event that the referral list is exhausted and the  
Union is temporarily unable to furnish qualified applicants within  
twenty-four (24) hours after receiving the request  
18  
(Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted), the Employer may  
temporarily employ others until the Union notifies the Employer  
that it has qualified registrants available for employment.  
Applicants hired by the Employer under this procedure  
shall be known as “temporary employees,” and will be subject to  
replacements. The Employer will notify the Union District Repre-  
sentative of the name, union affiliation (if any), date of employ-  
ment and social security number of such “temporary employee.”  
The Union will maintain a register of all such “temporary ernploy-  
ees” and such register shall be known as the temporary register.  
Such “temporary employees” may also be referred by the Union  
(when the referral list is exhausted) from Group F.  
Such “temporary employee” shall be subject to replace-  
ment by a qualified registered applicant under the procedure  
listed herein:  
1. The Union shall give a five (5) working day written  
notice to the Employer with whom the “temporary employee” is  
working and such “temporary employee” will thereupon be  
replaced at the end of the five (5) working day period provided  
the Union furnishes a qualified registered applicant.  
2. The Union will save the Employer harmless for any  
liabilities occurring under the application of the provisions of  
the temporary register.  
K. When an Employer states requirements for special  
skills or abilities in his/her request for employee applicants, the  
Union shall refer the first applicant on the register possessing  
such skills or abilities, regardless of the place or classification  
of such applicant on the register. If a contractor requests or  
requires that the operator be a Certified Operator, verification  
of the operator's certification is the responsibility of the Em-  
ployer. If the Employer notifies the Union in writing, within thirty  
(30) days of the employee’s discharge, of an Operator who  
had been in his employment and who had not performed  
satisfactorily, and the Employer does not wish this Operator to  
be referred to the Employer for future employment, the Union  
shall honor this written request.  
L. Any employee who quits a contractor without proper  
notice and is subsequently hired by an Employer with whom  
Local 18 has a contractual relationship without a proper referral  
by Local 18 shall be discharged by the Employer when it is  
called to his attention.  
19  
34. Employers shall give first opportunity to persons  
registered for employment, as provided herein, by calling or  
notifying the Union at any of its offices in the territory where the  
work is to be performed.  
35. Registration of applicants and selections of appli-  
cants for referral to jobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis  
and shall not be based on or in any way affected by Union  
membership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provi-  
sions, or any other aspects or obligation of Union membership,  
policies, or requirements. Itis mutually agreed that the Employer  
and the Union shall abide by all of the laws of the United States,  
the State of Ohio, the Commonweaith of Kentucky, and lawful  
orders thereof in nondiscrimination and fair employment practices.  
The Employer and the Union shall not discriminate against  
nor limit employment opportunities of any employee, applicant  
for employment or applicant for Union membership or appren-  
ticeship training because of race, color, sex, age, religion,  
national origin or ancestry.  
The Union agrees to furnish an Employer, at his request,  
any statement or data required under any regulations re-  
ferred to herein.  
36. In addition to the above Registration Groups there  
established a Short Term Job Group. The sole purpose  
of this Short Term Job Group is to enable registrants to acquire  
time to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Registration in  
this group is limited to applicants eligible for Group A of this  
referral and all fourth year Apprentices showing proof of need  
for additional time to qualify for unemployment benefits.  
Applicants’ referral out of the Short Term Job Group will  
be limited to jobs of two (2) days or less duration in a calendar  
week or eight (8) days or less duration in a calendar month on  
equipment listed on their registration cards. Any refusals of  
jobs will cause the registrant's card to be removed from the  
Short Term Job Group deck. Dispatches for short term jobs as  
defined above will first be made from the Short Term Job  
Group. If the dispatcher is unable to fill the short term job order  
from the Short Term Job Group he/she will proceed to fitl the  
order from Groups A through F in accordance with the referral  
rules. Dispatcher should notify Employers when dispatching  
from the Short Term Job Group. The Employer reserves the  
right to request dispatch from Group A.  
20  
Since this Short Term Job Group is intended to provide limited  
employment for those needing credit for unemployment compen-  
sation, the Union shall, through its business agents, remove from  
employment any Operating Engineer who has accumulated more  
than two (2) days per calendar week or over eight (8) days in a  
calendar month—as a result of the Short Term Job Referral Group.  
Registrants in the Short Term Job Group will not be  
eligible for any recall or request provisions of the referral as  
herein described. Employment received asa result of the Short  
Term Job Group referral will not provide eligibility for Employer  
recall when the registered in Group A, Preferred A,  
or Group A Retirees deck. Apprentices or Trainees will not be  
permitted to register in the Short Term Job Group except as  
noted above. Registrants may not register in the Short Term  
Job Group or Group Aor Preferred A or Group A Retirees deck  
at the same time. The Employer shall not be permitted to  
transfer employees dispatched from the Short Term Job Group  
from one project to another project.  
The Union will save the Empioyer harmless for any liabili-  
ties occurring under the application of the provisions of the  
Short Term Job Group.  
All the remaining rules with regard to the operation of the  
referral shall be applicable to the operation of the Group A,  
Preferred A and Group A Retirees except as modified above.  
37. Any registrant or any Employer who may feel ag-  
grieved by the operation of this referral system shall have the  
right to and mustfile his/her grievance, in writing, (10)  
days after the occurrence of the event concerning which he/  
she complains with a Board of Review and Arbitration consist-  
ing of one (1) representative of the Union, one (1) representa-  
tive of the Employer, and an impartial third member to be  
selected by agreement of the Union and the Employer, and the  
decision of this Board shall be final and binding on all parties.  
38, This statement as to referrals shall be posted in all  
places where notices to Employers and applicants for employ-  
ment are customarily posted, including all offices of the Union;  
all offices of the Employer.  
49. A Labor Relations Division Representative of the  
AGC of Ohio may inspect the referral register at the Union  
District Office at any time during normal office hours.  
21  
40. Allofficers and business representatives of the Union  
who have had previous work experience in any one or more of  
the job classifications contained in this Agreement shalt be  
deemed to be employed at the trade and it is the intent of this  
section to provide that upon return to the employment in  
the trade, he shall do so with the same preference as if he  
had continually worked at the trade and shail be eligible upon  
registration for Group A.
