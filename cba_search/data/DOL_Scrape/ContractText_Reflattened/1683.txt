### VACATION SAVINGS FUND  
### 
1501 - The parties have established a Southwest Carpenters Vacation Trust. Each Contractor  
shall make payments in the amounts designated in Section 1501.1 of the Southwest Carpenters  
Vacation Trust.  
1501.1 - Effective July 1, 2005, Contractors shall pay the sum of one dollar and six cents ($1.10)  
per hour for each hour worked by employees covered thereby to Trustees of the Southwest  
Carpenters Vacation Trust. The amount of fifty cents ($.50) per hour for vacation and sixty cents  
($.60) per hour for check-off dues 1s incorporated in the wage rates set forth in the wage rate  
section. The one dollar and six cents ($1.10) per hour contribution should be deducted from the  
employee’s pay due after all applicable taxes have been withheld and forwarded in the manner  
established by the signatory parties hereto.  
1502 - The contributions so made shall be deemed to be, and shall be treated as, subject to  
withholding tax and Social Security and Unemployment taxes, a part of the total compensation  
payable at the end of the individual employer’s payroll period during which such work is  
performed or paid for, but the full per-hour payments shall be transmitted to the Plan.  
1503 - The provisions of Paragraphs 1202, 1203, 1204 and 1205 are incorporated into this  
Article by reference.  
1504 - Subject to the following conditions, the Contractor agrees that he shall, if he is furnished  
with his employee’s written authorization to do so, deduct the sum of sixty cents ($0.60) per hour  
or the amount of Supplemental Dues that are lawfully required by the Union from the amounts  
required to be paid as outlined in Article 18 to this Agreement for each employee covered hereby  
for each hour worked or paid for in each payroll period commencing July 1, 2005 as Check-off  
Dues. In implementing the foregoing, the Carpenters Southern Administrative  
Corporation has been designated as Agent for the purpose of receiving and holding written  
authorization cards and for receiving, holding and allocating and distributing the dues moneys.  
1505 - Said Check-off Dues shall be transmitted to said Agent concurrently with, but not as a  
part of, the Employer’s monthly vacation contributions with respect to his employees covered by  
this Agreement to the Carpenters Vacation Savings and Holiday Plan (Vacation Trust). All sums  
deducted by the Employers pursuant to the provision of this Article shall, from the instant of  
their deduction, be considered dues if proper authorization shall have been furnished. All other  
sums transmitted by the Employers pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall, from the  
instance of their transmittal, be considered vacation-holiday contributions if no such proper  
authorization shall have been furnished and shall be held by the Vacation Trust for the account of  
the employee. Prior to the deposit in the separate bank accounts of the Agent, on the one hand,  
and the Vacation Trust, on the other, the bank shall separate the funds transmitted into dues and  
vacation-holiday contributions, respectively, based on whether or not a proper dues deduction  
authorization shall have been filed. The bank shall then deposit such sums in the account of  
either the Agent or the Vacation Trust. The Union shall bear the entire responsibility for  
furnishing the written authorization referred to above. All costs incident to receipt,  
Administration and remittance to the Union of the Check-off Dues payment shall be borne solely  
and entirely by the Union. This provision shall not reduce the obligations of the Contractor to  
pay the full amount of vacation contributions specified in this Agreement. All written  
authorizations referred to above shall be irrevocable for a period of one (1) year from the date of  
the execution and shall renew automatically from year to year thereafter, unless the employee, by  
written notice served upon the Local Union and/or the Agent not more than twenty (20) days and  
not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration of the first year or any year thereafter, shall  
have revoked such authorization.
