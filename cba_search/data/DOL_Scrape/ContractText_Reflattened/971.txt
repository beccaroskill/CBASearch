### ARTICLE XXIX  
### CENTRAL PENSION FUND  
### 
1. The Employer agrees to contribute to the Central Pension Fund,  
4115 Chesapeake Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20016, in the amounts as set  
forth in Article XXVII for each actual hour paid (excluding holiday not worked) to  
the Engineers Joint Benefit Fund 101 Intrepid Lane, PO Box 100 Colvin Station,  
Syracuse, New York, 13205-0100 or any other depository selected by the  
Trustees, in the mode and manner as determined by the Board of Trustees of

Contractors of America, New York State Chapter, Inc., and Loca! Union 17 of the  
International Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO.  
2. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,  
the parties agree that any employer who becomes delinquent in the payment of  
contributions due to the Central Pension Fund after notice has been served upon  
such delinquent Employer shall be tiable for not only the amount of contributions  
due, but in addition thereto, any interest, costs and fees of collection. Legal fees  
due shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the amount of said delinquency

### ARTICLE XXX  
### DRUG/ALCOHOL ABUSE POLICY AND PROGRAM  
### 
The Employers and the Union affirm that construction jobsites subject to  
this agreement must be alcohol and drug free.  
Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by medical, public health  
authorities, the Employers, and the Union as a disease. Excessive use of  
alcohol or other drugs by workers impairs their ability to function, contributes to  
increased absenteeism and the violation of safety rules. This in turn disrupts  
work schedules with consequent dissatisfaction among the majority of workers  
who are sincerely trying to do a conscientious job. This combination of factors is  
recognized as having a potentially damaging effect on the American construction  
industry and it endangers the job security of the worker and the safety and well  
being of everyone at the jobsite.  
The Employers and the Union express their joint determination to, deal  
cooperatively and constructively with the problem of substance abuse among’  
employees represented by the Union.  
To this end the Employers and the Union have agreed to diligently work  
together to develop a program which involves the appropriate means for  
identifying those persons with drug or alcohol problems and the appropriate  
measures to be taken when these problems are identified.  
The Employers and the Union will negotiate a new Drug and Alcohol Abuse  
Policy by September 1, 2005.  

### ARTICLE XXxXI  
### NON-DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT  
### 
The Employer and the Union mutually agree that they will comply  
and cooperate with all laws, codes, rules, regulations, executive orders and  
administrative decisions, whether State or Federal, dealing with non-  
discrimination in training, membership, employment, job tenure, promotions and  
every other matter covered by such laws, codes, etc., not herein expressly  
mentioned. The use of masculine or feminine gender in this Agreement shall be  
construed as including both genders.

### ARTICLE XXxXll  
### SUCCESSORS  
### 
1. This Agreement for on-site heavy and highway construction as  
provided in Articte Ill, Section 1, and in Article V, shall be binding upon members  
of the LRD/AGC, Western New York Region, at the expiration of the previous  
Agreement; during the course of negotiations; on the effective date of this  
Agreement; and contractors who become members of the LRD/AGC, Western
