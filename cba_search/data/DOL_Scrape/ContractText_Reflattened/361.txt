of an inability to perform the primary functions of the iob APSA shal! be notified, in writing,  
of ihe name of each member of the bargaining unit to be placed on ¢isplaced status concurrently with such  
notice to the individual.  
643 The goal of placing employees in displaced status is to provide an opportunity for the  
employee to seek a new position or work assignment. Hence, an employee ir cispiaced status would  
normally be assigned work during the displaced period. If an emplovee elects tc seek erapleyment within

one days an employee may elect to terminate employment and receive notice benefits and severance

during the ninety-one day period in displaced status.  
625 Disability Leave - Return to Work

find suitable work if the employee’s position has been filled or eliminated during the leave, or if the  
employee is no longer able to perform that type of work. An employee returning from temporary disability  
leave normally returns to the same organization and position. An emplovee mav be put in displaced status  
if his or her position has been eliminated or filled due to a critical need, or 1f the employee can no Jonger  
perform the primary functions of that position.  
647 An employee on temporary disability leave or Long-Term Disao lity (L.TD) may participate  
in a rehabilitation program that allows the employee, under approved circumstances, to return to work to his  
or her previous position or similar position on a part-time basis. The employee will receive full-time  
regular benefits from the Corporation, as well as pay for hours worked. and where the employee elected  
LTD coverage. proportionally reduced disability benefits from the insurer, provided the insurer approves  
the individual's rehabilitation program.  
15  
648 Termination Pay  
649 Employees who voluntarily terminate employment receive no termination pay. Employees  
terminated involuntarily for reasons other than a reduction in force receive two (2) weeks’ termination pay  
if employed for six (6) months or more, or one (1) week’s pay if employed for less than six (6) months.  
Employees terminated for cause sufficient to render continued employment detrimental to the corporation's  
interests or as a consequence of ongoing corrective action receive neither advance notice nor termination  
pay.  
650 An employee who is terminated in a reduction in force shall receive severance pay in  
accordance with the Corporation’s severance pay policies (see Appendix E, Employee Programs, Section 9,  
Severance Pay). If a person who has been so terminated is rehired, such person shall be rehired as a new  
employee unless the rehire is within a period of one (1) year and the person rehired repays to the  
Corporation the sums he or she has received as pay in lieu of notice and severance pay to the extent such  
pay exceeds the product of the employee’s weekly wage at the time of the reduction multiplied by the  
number of weeks the employee was unemployed. Any sums so returned shall constitute the full extent of  
the severance pay available for such employee in the event of a subsequent reduction except that such  
employee shall thereafter accrue additional weeks of severance pay at the rate of one (1) week of severance  
pay for each year of subsequent employment up to a maximum total of nineteen (19) weeks.
